Yet I had never met him and have never seen a photograph. In the haste with which he and my grandmother were removed from their home in the foothills of Hungary’s Carpathian mountains in June 1944, family snaps were lost.But it was not just Sandor and Fanya who came into my mind on my visits to the death camp. I thought, too, of my uncles, Danny, Ference and Ignatz, who died in work camps after they were taken from their families at the outbreak of war.And I remembered my two aunts and a cousin.          Russian soldiers with liberated inmates at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in 1945Miraculously, they survived the brutality of those who guarded them in Auschwitz, the excruciating hunger pangs and the penetrating cold which made their bones ache in the bleak mid-European winter beneath the flimsy, rough-cotton, concentration camp garb.And there was another uncle, my father’s brother Martin, who emerged from his own odyssey of hell in the camps where he was tortured after his escape attempt was thwarted.The 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, commemorating the moment Russian troops uncovered the horrors that lay within this vast complex in southern Poland, was marked on Thursday at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, Israel’s memorial to the Holocaust. Prince Charles was among more than 40 world leaders to attend.Today, Holocaust Memorial Day — and the actual anniversary of the liberation — will be honoured at Auschwitz itself and in London. But with each passing commemoration, the distance of time reduces the number of those who were witnesses to the atrocities.Members of my own family who were affected have passed on in recent years. My father Michael, who came to Britain as a refugee after the war had broken out, died in 2018.The uncle who survived the camps has also gone. Amazingly, the three other survivors — my father’s two sisters and niece — live on, now in their 90s.         The entrance to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland pictured this monthTheir immense fortitude, the spirit which kept them alive through the worst horrors of the 20th century, remains intact.But for these women, who experienced first-hand the barbarity of the Nazis and their fascist Hungarian collaborators, recent years have not been easy as echoes of the past have returned in the form of anti-Semitism.Here in Britain, this most tolerant of countries, anti-Semitism in the Labour Party dominated headlines during last year’s general election campaign.         Alex Brummer has written about how the holocaust impacted his familyChief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis felt the need to caution that the ‘very soul of the nation is at stake’. That did not prevent swastikas being daubed on buildings in the London suburb of Hampstead.Which is why, on this anniversary, it is more important than ever to remind the world where anti-Semitism can lead — because there can be no starker illustration of it than Auschwitz-Birkenau.My grandparents were dairy farmers and life was hard. My grandfather was up before crack of dawn every day to do the milking. But there were relaxing family moments, too.On Sabbath afternoons, in fine weather, he would gather the children around him under the overhanging pear tree in the garden, reading from The Bible and studying with the older boys.In the evenings, he would be joined on the terrace by friends from the village they would drink a little schnapps, tell stories and play cards and draughts.His mother, meanwhile, would busy herself in the kitchen preparing her specialities, including rolled cabbage leaves filled with meat, rice and spices, served with paprika and tomato sauce.         The remains of the barracks and main building at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration campMy father Michael left home at 14 to become apprenticed to a glassworker in Pressburg — now Bratislava in Slovakia. He later trained as a naval officer at a college near Genoa that had been established by Zionists.In 1938, as the grip of Nazi Germany tightened across Europe, my father decided to join his elder brother Philip who was a rabbi near Liverpool. Before he left, he returned to visit his parents in Hungary and was beaten up by fascist thugs when he arrived at the station in his home town close to the Hungarian-Czech border.But he managed to see his family and resolved then to take his younger brother Martin with him. At the crossing into Czechoslovakia, however, Martin was turned back by border guards and my father continued to Britain alone. Six years later, in 1944, Adolf Eichmann, architect of the Final Solution, issued orders for Hungary’s Jews to be rounded up and transported to the death camps.For most of my childhood, the Holocaust was a forbidden subject, only talked about in knowing whispers. But over the years, piece by piece, I have pulled together the story of those family members who entered the gates of Auschwitz.I learned that it was the courage and tenacity of my cousin, Shindy — then a teenager — who helped to keep my two aunts, Rosie and Sussie, alive amid the inhumanity. It was she who bargained for bread and made the deals that ensured their survival in the camp.My father made his way through a Europe already at war and eventually arrived at London’s Victoria station — and, by accident, in the ladies’ waiting room. There, he was befriended by an ‘elegant English lady’ who helped him across the city and put him on a train for Liverpool. From that single act of kindness, he developed a lifelong admiration for British tolerance.         President of the World Jewish Congress Ronald Lauder, Holocaust survivors and former prisoners pictured at Auschwitz-Birkenau ahead of the 75th anniversary of its liberationIt was only after the war, in 1947, that my father and his elder brother Philip — both by then settled in Brighton — received a telegram out of the blue from the Swedish Red Cross.It said that they had three young women by the name of Brummer who claimed to have relatives in Britain. Was this so? Could they be returned to the family? Would my father and his brother be willing to pay the passage to the UK?It was a joyous moment. Nothing had been heard of them in the years since the war ended, and it was assumed that they had perished in the gas chambers like my grandparents.Meanwhile, my father’s younger brother Martin had been moved between work camps and death camps. It transpired that, on an attempted escape from one camp, the Nazi guards seized him and tied him down on the railway lines to punish him. They left him there for many hours in the bitter cold and only cut him loose seconds before an approaching locomotive bore down on him.Martin’s survival — he died five years ago in Israel — and those of the three women has always felt like a small victory against the vicious cruelty that cost my grandparents their lives.But still the shadow cast by the Nazis will always fall blackly upon my family, which is why I felt it so important to go to pay my respects at the place where they fell.I have now been twice to that place of death to bear witness, to heed the words of Nobel Peace Prize-winning author Elie Wiesel: ‘Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to life as long as God himself. Never.’         The group are pictured walking around the camp almost 75 years after it was liberated by Russian soldiers when they entered southern PolandOn my first visit in the Nineties, we drove past cultivated fields and white-painted houses with bright orange roofs on the hour-long journey from Krakow airport to Auschwitz.By the time we crossed those infamous railway tracks and saw the most chilling station name in the world, the sky had darkened, with a swirling wind and pelting rain. The horror of what faced us became real, and a dull ache grew in the pit of my stomach.Today, this is not some remote facility it is surrounded by industrial buildings with shops and petrol stations, their architecture blending into that of Auschwitz 1 — the main camp — itself. It is a death camp in suburbia.And yet the smell of burning corpses — which decades later still permeates the nearby crematoria — seems to linger here, too, a horrific reminder of what took place inside the gates with their iron sign that reads ‘Arbeit macht frei’ (Work brings freedom).There is nothing immediately alarming about Auschwitz 1. The reconstructed barracks, surrounded by grass verges and lined with trees, could be mistaken for a housing estate. But at Block 4, there is a quiet, terrible reality.In a stark room, where the smell of chemical preservative takes one by surprise, human hair is piled up like a mountain.Shaved from Jews before they were led to gas chambers, much of the hair is grey now, turned so by time and poor conservation. Yet still I searched for a trace of red — a family trait — as if it could be possible there was a direct link to be found here. We sheltered from the bitter weather next to Block 10. This was a gruesome spot, where Nazi doctor Josef Mengele experimented on women.         A guard tower standing vacant at the edge of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in PolandAnd my mind flashed back to the hushed tones of my childhood: visiting an aunt in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, her health permanently damaged by her time in the camp, after she had given birth to a tiny baby kept alive only by the skills of modern medicine.The physical scars may have healed but the psychological impact has cascaded down the generations. The survivors in my family live with the past every day.My Aunt Rosie lost her sense of smell because of the stench of the camps. The filth she was forced to live with left her with an obsession over cleanliness.When I last spent time with my Uncle Martin (my father’s younger brother), his body began to shudder and he was quickly moved to tears as he remembered his personal torment in a different death camp.And if you set foot in one of these places, even for a few hours, it is easy to understand why survival was truly a life sentence.How could it not be so if you had witnessed monstrosities such as Auschwitz’s ‘Wall of Death’, where thousands of prisoners, having been tried by Gestapo kangaroo courts, were summarily shot and their bodies dragged away on carts to the permanently smouldering funeral pyres. Next to that wall today, barbed wire stands bleakly against the sky.         This aerial image shows the remains of the barracks for prisoners at Auschwitz II - Birkenau camp in December last yearNearby, one can climb down into the only gas chamber not destroyed by the SS as Russian troops approached. Standing under the grates in the ceiling, through which the Zyklon B gas was released on to naked Jewish bodies, tears flowed again down my face. That faint smell of burning, from the crematorium next door, intensified the overwhelming effect.There are rough wooden barracks as far as the eye can see, punctuated by the chimneys of the Nazi death factory. Inside, the roughly hewn wooden bunks, which each held five or six souls, are intact. Seeing them, I recalled the stories of my aunts huddling together for warmth.Grass now grows around the buildings but at the entrances, where our feet sank into the mud and ashes, one could almost smell the fetid stink of human decay.We walked for a mile or so down the side of the railway track that brought in the cattle trucks of Jews, Romanies and political dissidents from every corner of occupied Europe. Journeys of 1,200 miles or more, without food or water, journeys on which the corpses would eventually outnumber the living.I recalled my cousin describing her departure from Hungary: the Jews begging through the cattle-truck openings for water from the Hungarians who had been their childhood friends and neighbours. Instead, they were offered salt.The tragic roll call of the members of my family who perished — my grandparents Sandor and Fanya, my uncles Danny, Ference and Ignatz — must never be erased.And for the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of survivors and refugees, who have enjoyed good lives in Britain, it is fitting that the Duchess of Cornwall, with world leaders and other dignatories, will today share in our grief at Auschwitz, standing shoulder to shoulder with the last survivors in tribute to the million who were brutalised, starved and slaughtered.They — we — will remember them again and weep for a generation that must never be forgotten."},{"url":null,"title":"ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER asks real Profumo story locked vault","story":"Share this article Lord Denning concluded that there had been no threat to national security and cleared the security services of any involvement in manipulating the outcome of Ward\u0027s trial.Ward himself was in a coma when the jury returned its guilty verdict. He had taken an overdose of sleeping pills the night before, after hearing the judge\u0027s brutal summing-up from the dock in the Old Bailey.He died three days later and a potentially damning testimony about the conduct of leading politicians died with him.At the time, many regarded Denning\u0027s published report — it became a bestseller — as a whitewash. This position gained renewed credibility in 1993, when it was revealed that then Prime Minister John Major had ruled that the materials and documents gathered in the course of preparing the report could not be made public under the usual \u002730-year rule\u0027.          A poster for Stephen Ward: The Musical (pictured) which was written by Andrew Lloyd WebberInstead, the full dossier was to remain under wraps for a further 70 years.It was rumoured that Major was so intrigued, he had asked to see extracts from the full report before agreeing to lock it away. What he read evidently convinced him.Some gossips have drawn scurrilous inferences from the fact that a sketch by Ward of Prince Philip, whom he had treated for a back problem, had made its way to Lord Astor\u0027s country home, Cliveden — where John Profumo first spied Christine swimming naked in the pool.But the impression I get from my own enquiries is that the secrets hidden in Denning\u0027s full report are far more serious than any alleged indiscretions by a member of the Royal Family. After all, the Netflix drama The Crown alluded heavily to Philip\u0027s occasional visits to Cliveden, and the Official Secrets Act was not invoked.When I raised the issue in the House of Lords — I was made a Conservative peer in 1997 — my question was batted away.Afterwards, one or two knowledgeable souls hinted to me that the papers might no longer exist in the National Archives at Kew.They said the report might have been quietly \u0027lost\u0027, just as the transcript of Ward\u0027s trial had been lost.The only possible explanation for such an undemocratic action would be that Denning uncovered something of the utmost gravity.What that could be, we can only speculate — but remember that 1963 was also the year MI6 mole Kim Philby fled to Russia after years of spying for Moscow.         Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, 71, (pictured) continues to ask why the real story of the Profumo affair is still locked in a vaultDuring our conversation, Mandy Rice-Davies simmered with anger at the injustice she felt had been done to Stephen Ward.\u0027He was not a pimp,\u0027 she said. \u0027He just loved people.\u0027Her loyalty was fascinating. She could easily have resented Ward for dragging her into a life of vice.When she met him, she was just 16, a policeman\u0027s daughter who had worked as a glamour model and a dancer in Soho. Ward introduced her to a thuggish landlord named Peter Rachman, who was notorious for renting out his slum tenements to immigrants at extortionate rents.For Mandy\u0027s 17th birthday, Rachman bought her a Jaguar even though she hadn\u0027t yet passed her driving test.This was a world of sleaze which, as a 13-year-old pupil at Westminster School when the Profumo Affair broke, I could not begin to comprehend. But what I, and everyone else in the country, found unbelievable was that girls like Mandy and Christine had been welcomed at Cliveden and some of the grandest homes in England.The man who made that possible was Mandy\u0027s friend and corrupter, Stephen Ward.Over the decades, I often contemplated writing a musical around the Profumo Affair, and every time I came back to the central figure of Ward.He was undeniably charismatic, counting Royals, film stars, peers and spies among his chums.Few who knew him spoke ill of him. Instead, they remarked on how elegantly dressed, how generous, how sweet-natured, how oddly innocent he was. No man in England, it has been said, could wear sunglasses with such raffish charm as Stephen Ward.So I was intrigued when, at a friend\u0027s birthday party, I was introduced to the veteran journalist Tom Mangold with the words: \u0027This is Tom. He was the last man to see Stephen Ward alive.\u0027Tom, a reporter at the Daily Express in 1963, had befriended Ward during his trial.On the evening after the judge\u0027s closing remarks, Tom went to Ward\u0027s flat in Chelsea and found him despondent. If he had stayed over, Ward would probably not have taken the lethal overdose of drugs — but Mangold had to get home that night for family reasons.Mangold\u0027s interest in the story has not abated, incidentally: in a BBC2 documentary broadcast last night, he argued that the full Denning Report remains secret because its author had uncovered details of a long-running and depraved affair between another Cabinet minister — not Profumo — and a prostitute that posed a far greater security risk.But if I was intrigued by meeting Tom, meeting Mandy left me hooked. With the playwright Christopher Hampton and lyricist Don Black, I embarked on turning Ward\u0027s story into a stage spectacular.Some context: I was not a well man at the time, suffering from serious complications after treatment for back pain by (oh, the irony) a highly recommended osteopath. I was spaced out on super-strength painkillers.Looking back, I realise morphine and musicals don\u0027t mix. Large parts of the writing of Stephen Ward: The Musical are a blank to me. I don\u0027t recall how I got to the show\u0027s first night in 2014, for instance.I am proud of many of the songs and truly believe that, although it was deeply flawed, it had the bones of a terrific musical. But it closed after three months, causing me to recall the words of U.S. theatre impresario Jimmy Nederlander Sr, who once told me: \u0027There is no limit to the number of people who won\u0027t buy tickets to a show they don\u0027t want to see.\u0027Perhaps if I\u0027d called it Mandy And Christine: The Musical, it would still be playing to packed houses. Who knows?Mandy Rice-Davies loved the show. Sadly, she died in 2014 from cancer. If Christine Keeler ever came to see the production, she kept it quiet.Stephen Ward desperately wanted to be a fully paid-up member of the Establishment. Yet it was the Establishment that eventually destroyed him, possibly to protect its own.Ward had pleaded with MI5 to let him be an agent, gathering intelligence on his high-society friends. Perhaps, unwittingly, he was on the fringes of a conspiracy that even now could shake this country to its core. I wonder if we will ever know.

As a result, he was hired by Tina Brown as Tatler’s society photographer, with an insider’s eye for the edge between observation and satire. When Brown moved to New York in 1984 to edit Vanity Fair, Jones moved too, in 1988.Nearly a decade later, in 1997, he was sent to photograph Vanity Fair’s annual Oscars bash by Brown’s successor as editor, Graydon Carter. He was struggling to find a good image until he noticed Mick Jagger sitting by himself looking bored, the world’s least likely wallflower. “Madonna crossed the room and sat down next to him,” Jones recalls. “She started talking and he became quite animated. Then Tony Curtis came along and sat down at the same table on the other side and started monopolising Madonna.

Fiction can’t be far behindRoland Barthes was speaking metaphorically when he suggested in 1967 that “the birth of the reader must be ransomed by the death of the author”. But as artificial intelligence takes its first steps in fiction writing, it seems technology may one day start to make Barthes’ metaphor all too real.AI is still some way off writing a coherent novel, as surreal experiments with Harry Potter show, but the future isn’t so far away in Hollywood. According to Nadira Azermai, whose company ScriptBook is developing a screenwriting AI: “Within five years we’ll have scripts written by AI that you would think are better than human writing.”Self-promotion aside, if there is the possibility of a decent screenplay from ScriptBook’s AI within five years, then a novel composed by machines can’t be far behind. But it’s hard to shake the impression that, even if such novels eventually turn out to be “better than human writing”, something would be lost.Perhaps the feeling comes from an idea that would be anathema to Barthes: the idea of literature as communication.If a book is “a heart that only beats in the chest of another”, as Rebecca Solnit suggests, then it seems two parties are required: someone to write and someone to read. So when AI writes fiction there seems to be a missing piece, a void at the heart of the text where meaning should reside.Barthes would have none of this, of course, insisting that “it is language which speaks, not the author”. In terms which strikingly anticipate the workings of software currently at the cutting edge of artificial writing, such as OpenAI’s GPT-2, he argues that a text is not a “line of words … releasing a single … meaning (the ‘message’ of the Author-God)”, but instead a “tissue of citations, resulting from the thousand sources of culture”. “The writer can only imitate a gesture forever anterior, never original,” Barthes continues. “If he wants to express himself … the internal ‘thing’ he claims to ‘translate’ is itself only a readymade dictionary whose words can be explained (defined) only by other words, and so on ad infinitum.”And he must be on to something. Imagine yourself, some years in the future, pulling a novel by an unknown author off the shelves and finding that it is really good. Would you be any less moved by the story if you were then told it had been produced using groundbreaking AI? If all you had were the words in front of you on the page, how would you even know? Those who scoff at the idea that AI could ever pass this literary Turing test haven’t been paying attention for the past 50 years. Computers can now drive cars, recognise faces, translate between languages, fill in as your personal assistant, even beat the world champion at Go – achievements that are often dismissed as “just computation” even though an expert of the 1970s would have classed any one of them as a signature ability of human intelligence.Should publishers decide the future of literature is written in code, there may still be some hope for authors. A shift to AI-generated novels could only ever be a short-term strategy. As Barthes intuited and OpenAI’s latest algorithm demonstrates, it’s certainly possible to assemble writing from other writing. But even if this patchwork prose becomes “better than human writing”, it would be only drawing on a finite well of inspiration. Train your AI on the sum total of human literature thus far and all you’ll get is a mass of references: “a gesture forever anterior, never original”. No one who witnessed the phenomenon that was the Fifty Shades of Grey series could doubt that imitation can be lucrative for a while. But when even an imitator as skilful or as lucky as EL James finds her sales on a downward curve it’s clear that no matter how feisty your stallion at first appears, flogging it will only get you so far.Barthes’ belief in the primacy of the word, his dogged insistence that “life can only imitate the book”, leaves his recipe for literature missing a vital ingredient: the inidual experience that any human writer facing the blank page cannot avoid. Without the raw input of the complicated business that is life, even the most talented AI can only rearrange the books it ingested in its training – enough for a few good years in publishing, perhaps, but hardly a sustainable model for literary culture.Maybe I’m thinking too small. Maybe any publisher looking forward to the death of the author would only need to expand the training programme for their writing machines. Perhaps they could hook their AIs up to the daily news, wire them into Spotify, encourage them to make new friends on Twitter – and feed it all back into the work. The resulting algorithms would be very different to human beings, of course. But perhaps they would be enough like thinking, feeling beings that their fiction would be communicating something rather marvellous after all.• Richard Lea writes for  books"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f328ae4230d567c94a6f1fbd38df45cbfbe43a8/161_124_745_447/master/745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b214ecdfc88be09d1655df36080db594","title":"humpback whales bunny chow and golden beaches why you should visit durban","story":"Desperate for a dose of winter sun? South Africa’s Durban delivers 320 days of sunshine every year, as well as surfing, foodie adventures and sensational land and sea safariOnce seen as the quiet cousin of cosmopolitan Cape Town and fast-paced Johannesburg, the natural wonders and cultural charms of Durban and its surrounds put it firmly on South Africa’s must-see map. Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.The best place for a first-look at “Durbs” – as the locals call it – is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.Shimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world’s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.With miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa’s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade – try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf – will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.From May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde’s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn’t enough, you can often spot dolphins ing in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time’s environmental research.Oceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you’ll find a neat cross section of the city’s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha’s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.But when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don’t leave without braving the famous “bunny chow”: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You’ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (£4.19).It’s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It’s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.There’s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.A 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You’ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers’ market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa’s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views – of breaching whales and the ocean – but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there’s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.Another 30 minutes’ drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort’s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.South Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours’ drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.Or head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.So now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing’s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.How to bookWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

Over four weekends they will discuss a range of issues with experts and decide on a set of recommendations for how the government can reach its target of net-zero emissions by 2050.Assembly member Leia, 20, from Darlington, said giving up her time for the cause was an easy decision to make: “You don’t get an opportunity to influence government policy very often and climate change is really important.”Another participant, Amanda, 56, a healthcare project manager from Kent, said: “I was really chuffed to be chosen. There were some things which I didn’t know about that I’ve learned today, which is really interesting, but I’ve always been quite green.”Invitations to the assembly were sent out to 30,000 households chosen at random, and of the over 1,500 people who responded asking to be considered, 110 were selected by a computer to be representative of society. There’s a mix of ages, genders, ethnic backgrounds and education levels, but also a range of views about the climate crisis.A citizens’ assembly is a group of people brought together to discuss an issue or issues, and reach a conclusion about what they think should happen, according to\u0026nbspthe definition\u0026nbspput forward by the House of Commons library.Citizens’ assemblies give members of the public the time and opportunity to learn about and discuss a topic, before reaching conclusions. Assembly members are asked to make trade-offs and arrive at workable recommendations.Facilitated by experts and combining small-group discussions with large-scale debates and a series of votes, members meet over a series of weekends with the goal of removing the conflicts of interest and tribal loyalties that can hamper politicians in reaching a conclusion.The people who take part are chosen randomly so they reflect the wider population in terms of demographics – age, gender, ethnicity and social class.The number of members involved can vary. A recent citizens’ assembly, formed to examine social care provision in England, had 47 members who were English citizens and eligible to vote in UK general elections.Citizens’ assemblies, and other similar methods, have been used in the UK and other countries, including Australia, Canada and the US, to address a range of complex issues. One of the most prominent to take place in recent years was the assembly established by the Irish parliament to address abortion after a decision had been made to have a referendum on the issue.Chris, a 32-year-old production engineer and father of two from Oxford, was unsure of the severity of the problem. “I wasn’t sure if it was a crisis. I’m not a climate denier as people will quite quickly say. Climate is real, it does change, it has changed. I appreciate man is changing it. But whether we’re at the level of crisis – I hadn’t seen enough information.”He was keen to hear directly from experts, and was pleased to see opinions being distinguished from facts. “My biggest fear coming here is that a decision would be made purely based on emotion with no logical steps or thought about the implementation or the impact.”The assembly heard from speakers at organisations including Natural England, the New Economics Foundation and Wellcome, and were given the chance to ask questions. Some of these were practical – “What’s more environmentally friendly, British beef or avocados?” – while some were more ethical – “How can we ensure the cost of changes don’t affect poorer people disproportionately?”Participants could hold up a yellow card if a speaker was going too fast, or a red card if they needed something explained or clarified. “It’s about distilling down the enormous complexity of climate change into small pieces of information that are accessible, balanced and meaningful for people, so it is quite a tall order,” said Prof Lorraine Whitmarsh, the director of the UK Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations, and one of the assembly’s expert leads.“Some people are probably totally comfortable with a lot of what’s been covered today, and some people will have never really heard anything of this kind before.”The day culminated with a talk from Sir David Attenborough, who was keen to give his thanks to the volunteers for giving up their time.“If you have a parliament of a fixed length of five years, it is very difficult to persuade politicians that they should give money and time and attention and worry to an issue which is not going to come to a climax – and people won’t know if it is successful or not successful – for 10 years, 15 years hence,” he said.“Your very existence here means members of parliament are taking it seriously. The people in this country ought to be extremely grateful to you, as indeed am I.”Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, observed the morning session and said she was impressed by the level of engagement from members. “The buzz in the room was brilliant. I just think it’s so important that politics is done with people, not to them … Look what happened with the gilets jaunes in Paris – people have to understand and feel as if they are part of the process.”She said her biggest concern was that the assembly discussions were based on the assumption that net-zero emissions should be achieved by 2050 and not earlier, but organisers said there would be time at the end of the process for members to discuss this if they wanted to.The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\u0026nbsp • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.• Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels. The government signed legislation last year to commit the country to net-zero emissions by 2050, although the Green party campaigns for a 2030 deadline, a target also supported by Labour.At just 17, Max from Hertfordshire was one of the youngest members of the assembly, and he was optimistic over the impact it could have: “If this whole thing ends up making a big difference, and the government really does listen, it means we’ll be leading a new movement internationally, and we need to be the leaders of a better tomorrow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3dc95181d849e44a30f9f2fd810ce45dcbdbb18/612_502_3433_2060/master/3433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6da03d54dcabd2aad45fd505273f2855","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, including white-tailed eagles and a detained lion cub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/271b08e039341a07fbad581a64376a6a2d78b3cd/0_3198_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c4443a0f93861a33507befbc1951a76","title":"observer food monthly 20 best potato recipes","story":"Roasted, chipped, mashed: a celebration of the power of the potatoLancashire hotpot, fisherman’s pie, Jane Grigson’s shepherd’s pie: few foods comfort like an old-school potato dish.

With not much in the way of action to talk about, however, the 16-year-old became the subject of post-match chatter, as a possible £30m move to Manchester United looms. The Birmingham manager, Pep Clotet, praised the teen’s character. Mark Robins, however, was even more effusive. “Jude Bellingham is outstanding,” said Coventry’s manager. “The power and pace at 16 is there for everybody to see. He’s going to be a top player.” The midfielder might look to previous youthful sensations who made the move to Old Trafford, such as Nick Powell or even Wilfried Zaha, and know there is no guarantee of continued progress. But at this point, and at such a tender age, it appears the stars are aligning for Bellingham. Paul MacInnesIf the flagship successes of Frank Lampard’s reign tend to be young and British, Mateo Kovacic’s prowess indicates the Chelsea manager is no one-trick pony. Underwhelming under Maurizio Sarri, notable largely for predictable substitutions involving Ross Barkley, the Croat has become a high-energy, high-class playmaker for Lampard. “I watched him last year and I liked him from afar,” said Lampard, who played a part in the decision to buy Kovacic. “It maybe wasn’t the easiest year for him.” It helps that his midfield is less rigid – “I never want it to be absolutely structured” – but Kovacic showed the ability to unlock Hull with a penetrative pass from deep. “I just saw a natural talent in the way that he can take people out of midfield and travel quickly with the ball,” Lampard added. “We have got a really good relationship, he loves to talk about his game and is very intelligent. I love working with him.” Richard JollyBilly Sharp is 34 next month. He has not scored since the opening day. But he produced a performance of revved-up, state-of-the-art centre-forward play at the Den, finding interesting spaces and standing out as a luminous presence in a muted game. Sharp has been around for so long it might be assumed his game would be all about the narrow areas close to goal at this stage. Not so here. The run to make space for Mo Besic’s opening goal was a piece of instinctive footballing art. At times Sharp stood on the touchline and let his midfield flood past. It isn’t hard to see why United fans and indeed their manager are so fond of a player who showed here Chris Wilder’s coaching and his eye for unusual movement have been eagerly received. Sharp has another year left on his contract. He looks good for it, a lesson in old dogs taking on new tricks. Barney Ronay“The last thought in my head as a I go to sleep tonight will be ‘what if’,” acknowledged Oxford’s manager, Karl Robinson, after Marcus Browne, his Middlesbrough loanee forward, missed a very presentable chance to book a fifth-round place. “Browny’s such a talent but his finishing is useless.” Such unvarnished honesty is rare among carefully PR-tutored Premier League managers but this was a day for candour with both Robinson and Steve Bruce admitting they would have much preferred extra-time andor penalties to an energy-sapping replay. That match could be worth £500,000 to Oxford but they are chasing promotion and Robinson says his players are “at breaking point”. Bruce, meanwhile, was furious to see his winter break plans ruined. “It was supposed to be a week off,” he said. “But what’s the point if they shove replays in. It’s ridiculous.” Louise TaylorThe idea of the FA Cup as “a great leveller” is one of English football’s hoariest cliches, yet at Shrewsbury a veteran central-defensive duo comprising a World Cup finalist and a Champions League winner were given the fright of their lives by a frontline made entirely of lower-league journeymen. Which is no slight whatsoever on Shaun Whalley, Callum Lang and Josh Laurent and Jason Cummings, a quartet who were everything their opponents weren’t: purposeful, precise and supremely unflustered. But Shrewsbury’s comeback demonstrated how abstract notions such as momentum and belief can still trump the hard currency of talent and pedigree. It made for a fantastic second-half spectacle as a gang of third-tier attackers ran riot against the likely Premier League champions, capped with a full-on pitch invasion by jubilant home supporters. Try telling them the FA Cup has lost its magic. Alex HessOf Manchester United’s summer signings, Daniel James has lately struggled and Aaron Wan-Bissaka is a fine defender unsuited to the club’s attacking traditions. Harry Maguire has also been the subject of concern, culpable amid multiple defensive pratfalls. It seems, though, that Ole Gunnar Solskjær cannot bear to be without his captain. While those other signings were rested at Tranmere, Maguire, playing through a torn hip muscle, soldiered on and should draw confidence from his performance. Playing left of a defensive trio allowed him to stride forward in the fashion that made his name at Hull and Leicester. His goal was beautifully struck before it deflected off Peter Clarke. He even got a rest when substituted just past the hour. The formation suggested a way forward for Solskjær and his most trusted lieutenant but tougher tests than this await, starting with Manchester City on Wednesday. John BrewinWest Ham are in a mess. The recruitment department is in pieces and was further stripped back when Manuel Pellegrini and his director of football, Mario Husillos, were fired. Pellegrini and Husillos both used their sons as scouts – they have departed too – and the dysfunction is deeply worrying given that West Ham, who were deservedly dumped out by 10-man West Brom, need signings before the transfer window shuts on Friday. David Moyes, who has his eye on the Slavia Prague midfielder Tomas Soucek, has made little impact since replacing Pellegrini and was unable to promise there will be much activity this week. David Sullivan, the club’s powerful co-owner, has resumed control of transfer negotiations and is under increasing pressure to get an unbalanced, injury-hit squad out of a hole. Jacob SteinbergIn what was the most routine of wins for Manchester City, where few forced themselves out of second gear to thrash the 10 men of Fulham, David Silva reminded the country of his greatness. The Spanish magician is leaving the Premier League at the end of the season, drawing the curtains on a decade in England. Since his arrival from Valencia he has arguably been the best player in those 10 years but his powers looked to be waning this season, no surprise for someone who turned 34 this month. Sunday, however, was another masterclass of skill, passing and intelligent running. Silva also showed his aggressive side to win the ball for Gabriel Jesus’s first goal, proving he still has the desire. We only have him for a few more months, so should cherish him before he departs for the final chapter of his career.

Some supporters might have felt RB Leipzig had already overindulged on that score during the Bundesliga’s hibernation period, with only a couple of high impact contributions from the red-hot Timo Werner rousing them from their slumbers against Union Berlin last week to take the points that maintained a healthy lead at the top of the table.Seven days later and Leipzig were still having trouble switching on for the full duration of proceedings, although the order of service was inverted this time around. Nagelsmann’s team began the afternoon by breathing the sort of flames Germany’s top flight has become used to in the last couple of years. They ended napping at the fireside as Eintracht Frankfurt turned up the volume and took over the party. Having had 12 efforts at goal to the home side’s one before the break, Lepizig were caught cold by Almamy Touré’s beautifully struck opener and rarely looked like getting back into it, before Filip Kostic profited from defensive confusion to finish them off in stoppage time.After scoring at least three in their previous nine Bundesliga matches, this was one heck of a comedown. Leipzig’s players admitted they’d been put off their stride by “robust” opponents, as Peter Gulacsi called them, while Konrad Laimer praised Frankfurt for having “defended really well from the first to the last second”.Yet it never really felt as if effort was the issue. “How nice it is when football professionals listen to their coaches,” Frankfurter Allgemeine’s Peter Hess wrote on Sunday morning. “Nagelsmann had advised his Leipzig before the game not to think so much about tactical things, but rather to get themselves to the right emotional level.” One wondered whether Leipzig had been so taken with that idea of physical engagement that they overlooked their more habitual smarts. They had swept Union aside the previous week with a rush of adrenaline, rather than any significant change of approach, riding the visceral thrill of Werner’s brilliance. They tried to do the same here in response to Touré’s wonder strike but ran aground against opponents that felt as if they were prepared.“In the first half we were clearly inferior, and sloppy,” said Eintracht’s coach, Adi Hütter. Yet their own preparation served them well. They were always likely to be chasing their tails in the first half of the season, attempting to replace their magical attacking trio of Sébastien Haller, Ante Rebic and Luka Jovic. Just as things had looked like unravelling before Christmas, they have been rewound up in 2020. This was a second straight win, partly informed by some big returns. Kevin Trapp, back to banish some fairly ordinary goalkeeping to distant memory, was tidy and influential before the break, and David Abraham also looks good after returning from the long ban that followed his bizarre assault on Freiburg’s Christian Streich.And then came Touré. Djibril Sow revealed the dressing room ribbing the French right-back had suffered after missing “a huge chance” at Hoffenheim last week. Touré retorted that he would set the record straight this week, but nobody imagined anything quite like this. The former Monaco defender had already looked the part in the adjustment to a back four, with Frankfurt solid in a 4-4-1-1. This rocket, so unexpected it had striker Bas Dost giggling while discussing it in a post-match television interview, was a welcome bonus.Nagelsmann and his charges did not feel much like laughing, even after a week in which they won the race to sign the feted Spanish attacking midfielder Dani Olmo. Leipzig have Borussia Mönchengladbach and Bayern up next. We’ll quickly find out if they have the mentality to carry on and reach the peak.• Bayern were meant to be tested by Schalke but after Robert Lewandowski breached the defence of one of his favourite victims in the sixth minute, it became a question of how many. Hansi Flick’s team – and especially Thomas Müller – were scintillating, the visitors were rabbits in the Allianz Arena Saturday night headlights and it would have been worse than 5-0 without VAR’s interventions. “You need several things to go for you if you want to win in Munich,” reflected Schalke’s coach, David Wagner, “and today none of those things happened.”• The Erling Braut Haaland show continued OK, his contribution wasn’t quite as pivotal this week as he came on to score the fourth and fifth goals in Dortmund’s 5-1 win over Köln on Friday night, but that left the Norwegian teenager with a barely believable five Bundesliga goals in 56 minutes of action. “I just think it’s a shame that Erling is letting up,” grinned goalkeeper Roman Bürki. “Three goals in Augsburg and only two tonight.” That Dortmund have scored 10 in two games in 2020, closed the gap at the top and still look vulnerable is perhaps a conversation for another day.• Gladbach were back in business after last week’s slump at Schalke, but they made heavy weather of beating Mainz via Alassane Pléa’s double – right up until Florian Neuhaus’ spectacular chip from way out over Robin Zentner’s head. Schalke’s keeper escaped near catastrophe at Borussia-Park two years ago when he took his eye off the ball and attempted to kick the penalty spot but he wasn’t so lucky this time around.• Friedhelm Funkel described speculation over his security as Fortuna Düsseldorf coach as “malicious”, but the chief executive, Thomas Röttgermann, has for weeks shied away from explicitly backing him and Sunday’s 3-0 defeat at Bayer Leverkusen has done him no favours. When Rouwen Hennings isn’t scoring, neither do they and Funkel badly needs a result against Frankfurt next week, if he makes it that far.• Fortuna now prop up the table after Paderborn’s impressive 2-0 win at Freiburg, with the quicksilver Christopher Antwi-Adjei opening the scoring after a storming run. They couldn’t stay up, could they?"},{"url":null,"title":"what pokemon can teach us about storytelling nintendo games","story":"Since 1996, the Pokémon games have exerted a fascination for fans, telling imaginative stories and encouraging a generation of players to question everything they see“This is it? This is the game?”I am in Italy with my partner, and just like every beach holiday since 1999, I have booted up Pokémon. This particular version is Pokémon Sun for the Nintendo 3DS, but all the games are fundamentally the same: you’re a child leaving home to catch and train tiny monsters so you can defeat various bosses and bad guys. My boyfriend, who has never played Pokémon, has just watched me eviscerate a grunt trainer with my level 41 Mudsdale.“It’s so … slow.”I consider, for the first time, what the Pokémon games look like to a person who has never played them. They are slow. A huge portion is just you, a 10-year-old, walking around and being assaulted by bats. The “battles” you enter with other trainers are fundamentally lacking in drama, and mostly consist of you smashing the same one or two moves over and over again. And the “moves”? You see very little of them. Rattata uses “tackle” and this is signified by a rat animation inclining slightly forward.Why have I been playing this game for 20 years? Because there are two different but adjoining games going on in Pokémon. There is one you play on your console, the plodding, multiple choice-based, “gotta catch ’em all” game that birthed an anime dynasty, then there is another that happens entirely in your own head.If you’ve ever played Pokémon, you know exactly what I’m talking about. The guilt you feel when it’s time to bench your Pidgeot – the one who started with you as a humble level 4 Pidgey on Route 1 – because you know he can’t take you to the dizzy heights of the Indigo Plateau. The overwhelming sense of gulping-for-air urgency when you and your team emerge, limping and faint, from another endless cave of poisonous Zubats and aggressive trainers. The strange existential panic when you use a thunder stone on your dainty Pikachu, so he may evolve into a hefty daddy Raichu. The game encourages you to evolve your Pokémon, bench the weak ones, and do whatever you can to succeed. The weirdly intense emotional state this summons is not a result of the slow gameplay mechanics but a cumulative effect of the writing. The games are essentially road movies. You journey through different towns, dropping in on lives already in progress, stories already in motion. And like any road movie, the visitor is only ever told as much as he needs to know. There are no Super Mario-style “Find the princess!” prompts. You are asked, simply, to read the room.One visceral example of this is Lavender Town, which you experience as a vague, unfinished ghost story. You arrive in this small village. Something is obviously wrong. Nothing is growing, there are no water features, and a shrill, repetitive 8-bit tune plays. You learn that this is the home of the only Pokémon graveyard. It is the first time we are introduced to the concept of death. We know Pokémon “faint” if they lose a battle, but healthcare being free and medication cheap, death is not something we’ve had to confront yet. But now we know: Pokémon die and they are mourned.That’s not all. Something terrible has happened here, and recently. One of the characters explains: “Ghosts appeared in Pokémon Tower. I think they’re the spirits of Pokémon that the Rockets killed.” So Lavender Town is haunted because of a massacre led by Team Rocket, something we hear nothing more about.The Pokémon games are full of stories like this: half-written, euphemistic, full of hints and easter eggs, and characters who allude to things that often never happen. For the first few hours of Pokémon Blue and Red, you are led to believe that a big plot with a Clefairy is about to kick off, and it simply never does. It creates a sense that you are living in a vast, complex world full of lost tales and broken people. Take the gym leaders. These are the game’s grimy local politicians, whose moods and preferences govern an entire region. The more you play, the more you read into their sad little lives. Brock’s backwoods gym is so dull you can practically hear your rubber soles squeaking on the floor as you destroy his Onix. At Lt. Surge’s deranged Electric-type gym you’re forced to sort through trash before he’ll even speak to you. Female-led gyms tend to be more elaborate – do they have to work harder to gain credibility? Is there inherent sexism in the gym leadership world? Maybe that’s why Erica has more trainers than anyone else. Maybe it’s a feminist thing. Maybe Erica is the AOC of Pokémon.From the beginning, Pokémon has encouraged this kind of close reading. Satoshi Tajiri, the president of Game Freak and creator of the franchise, began his career as a writer. He made a video arcade fanzine, also called Game Freak, which became hugely popular for its gamer tips and lists of easter eggs. In 1999, he gave an interview to Time magazine about the mysterious and elusive Pokémon named Mew, which was added to Pokémon Red and Blue at the last moment as a hidden extra. “There were 150 characters, and Mew was number 151,” Tajiri explained. “It created a myth about the game, that there was an invisible character out there … It kept the interest alive.”For decades, fan theories about how to find Mew circulated through forums. Most speculation centred on a small truck parked near a ship named SS Anne at Vermilion Harbour. The truck is only accessible with the aid of some crafty trading with another player for years, many players believed that Mew was hidden behind that elusive vehicle.The sparse storytelling has led to players filling in the gaps in other creative and fascinating ways. The world is mostly populated by children and elderly s, and your own father is absent. Lieutenant Surge, an Electric gym leader, alludes to combat, and is one of the few middle-aged men in the game. To many fans, the natural conclusion is that we are living a decade or so after a war so devastating that it claimed an entire generation of men. Suddenly, the lush forests, the free healthcare (didn’t the NHS begin after the second world war, after all?), the societal emphasis on having strong Pokémon who are willing to fight for you – it all makes sense.As a novelist, I’m keenly aware that people won’t commit to a story unless it engenders an ideological pact between writer and audience it has to encourage us to fill in the gaps and overinvest emotionally. I would feel ashamed to undertake such a close reading of the Pokémon games, if I weren’t absolutely sure that these theories live in the hearts and minds of millions of fans who spent their childhoods starting adventure after adventure, each more or less identical and yet all filled with imagination. These fans are easy to find. All you need to do is whisper the magic words: “I like shorts. They’re comfy and easy to wear.” Trust me, they’ll understand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b5df53eea4f1707b11f8fda0e6af1f266f69c2/0_3_5227_3137/master/5227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=068cda3cfd40c38f1040488550f3e168","title":"its incredible what they see housing associations take on county lines","story":"Housing officers are using their local knowledge to spot abuse and exploitation, particularly ‘cuckooing’ of vulnerable residents by drug gangsHousing associations are playing a growing role in tackling county lines crimes, using their knowledge of local communities to spot early signs of abuse and exploitation.In the north west of England, the exploitation of young people by drug gangs – known as “county lines” crime – is a serious problem, not just in poorer areas but in York, Harrogate and places with good transport links. Now lawyers, housing associations and police are building networks of support to try and provide innovative solutions to the crisis.One firm of solicitors told the  they are increasingly contacted by housing associations for help in responding to exploitation, in particular “cuckooing”.Cuckooing is a term for the takeover of a house owned by a vulnerable inidual by drug gangs from outside the area to use as a base.Darren Burton, head of housing at Forbes Solicitors, says housing associations have unique access to vulnerable communities.“Our clients provide social housing to the most vulnerable in society, making their tenants a target for criminals. There will often be dozens of people visiting the target address, causing antisocial behaviour, dealing and using drugs.“Housing associations are eyes and ears on the ground. More and more housing officers are reporting the signs of county lines and cuckooing to us. We are getting more calls than ever from housing associations asking for help with this issue.”Burton points to high-rise blocks where vulnerable people, who may have learning disabilities or mental health problems, can become isolated. “They are befriended and next thing they know the flat is taken over and someone from the gang is sleeping in the box room. A housing association can join up the dots they have always been there on the ground.”The ultimate legal sanction to stop cuckooing in a property is a premises closure, and these are on the rise across the UK. With the National Housing Federation, Forbes is lobbying for housing providers to have more statutory powers to close properties where there is evidence they are used for exploitation.But while Burton and his colleagues do work with the police, they also try to use street-level knowledge of families to help in other ways.“For example, one property we are looking at, it’s a hive of activity and the police know about it. So that might result in a premises closure. But we always start at the point that legal action is the last resort, particularly where there is a young person or family involved.“We have a case where a young person is living with his grandfather because his parents can’t look after him due to drug problems of their own. He gets involved in postcode gangs and bringing knives and drugs into the property. His grandfather is worried but the local housing association know this family because they have been in the area a long time so are able to offer help.”The firm has joined with Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Organised Crime Unit to build a network across the region looking for solutions.In one case where a man was dealing drugs from a property, the firm worked with police and a housing association to get a partial closure, which allowed the man’s partner and children to keep using the home but barred other visitors.Detective Inspector Andy Farrell of the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit told the  that these partnerships are increasingly vital in fighting child exploitation.“Across the region, areas with good transport links are vulnerable to cuckooing, like Harrogate, York and then over to the coastal areas of Scarborough, high areas of social deprivation. It’s really important now that we upskill housing associations and enhance their understanding of county lines. For example, we work with them on partial home closures so we don’t leave potential victims homeless.”He believes the deeper understanding now of how exploitation works is helping to tackle the crime in the longer term. “Now we are actually understanding that children who may have been criminalised previously are actually being exploited. Let’s look at early intervention, look at siblings of those who are being exploited and how we can ert them we will hopefully see that impact in the future.”Peter Fahy was Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police until 2015 and is now chair of a housing association, Plus Dane Housing. He says housing associations have unusual access at a community level, in areas where cuts have removed many welfare checks.“I had always been struck as a police officer that the closest relationship was with the local housing association and their housing officers. We know that in our housing stock there are people who are incredibly vulnerable, the HAs will know who those vulnerable people are.“For example, housing associations go into every property at least once a year to do a gas safety check and it’s incredible what they see. You have repair staff seeing child protection issues, or noting when elderly people are incredibly vulnerable. It’s about helping these staff understand the signs and know what to do about it.”It is not just cuckooing and drug dealing that housing associations are seeing up close, Fahy says.“Cuckooing is extremely worrying, but beyond that are other things like pop-up brothels. This is an extremely crucial housing issue. Criminals take over a house for a brothel through short term lets or Airbnb. These are operated from properties with very exploited people. It’s extremely hard to get them to speak, they have a fear of the exploiter reaching right back into their own home country or their family.”“There is a very high level of drug taking in our society. If you talk to youth charities they will say there is nothing we can do – kids are offered £1,000 a day to carry drugs and it’s hard to help them once they have got involved. There is little else for them to do in their communities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fd5eb050a5816cd20e351ab3b79be035b4bb295/0_0_5513_3308/master/5513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb4dcb44fe8645517cb1cf992b3b8879","title":"mogadishu left reeling as climate and conflict spark rural exodus","story":"Forced from their homes by floods and fighting, 800,000 people have crammed into informal settlements in the Somali capital. Now efforts are afoot to bolster local resourcesThe number of Somalians being pushed out of the countryside and into the capital Mogadishu has reached an unprecedented high, putting pressure on the city’s already poor infrastructure and threatening its faltering recovery from three decades of conflict.More than 800,000 internally displaced people dwell in informal settlements across Mogadishu, according to the office of the mayor. They are crammed into makeshift shelters with little or no sanitation and limited access to the most basic services. There are “critical” levels of malnutrition, according to an assessment by Somalia’s food security and nutrition analysis unit.Scattered over 700 sites across the capital, families mainly consisting of women and children share common latrines and survive on one meal a day.Last week, Goobjoog News, a local radio station in Mogadishu, reported that about a dozen children had died of starvation in one encampment in Kahda district. Among them, said the station, were young twins whose mother had been killed in last month’s truck bomb explosion.Every morning, women from the these camps head into the city centre, looking for casual jobs such as clothes washing. With no family or clan connections to the local host community, they face abuse and sexual exploitation.Mogadishu, second on Demographia’s 2015 ranking of the fastest growing cities in the world, has limited capacity to integrate such a large number of displaced people into its urban development system.“The most significant challenge posed by conflict and natural disaster induced displacement is its impact on rapid and unplanned urbanisation and the rural exodus,” said Dr Hodan Ali, head of Benadir regional administration’s durable solutions unit.“Mogadishu is emerging from 30 years of conflict. The infrastructure, basic services and local government capacity are extremely limited and, as such, its ability to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and impoverished members of the city is small.”Capitalising on the gap left by a weak government and the lack of a formal camp management system, an illicit business has sprung up, with “gatekeepers” soliciting land for new arrivals, linking them up with aid agencies, and in return taking a cut of what little aid they may receive.Humanitarian organisations with limited access to the camps due to security restrictions are left with little choice but to collaborate with the unofficial gatekeepers, in effect paying – and empowering – illicit middlemen.More people arrive in Mogadishu daily, driven to the city by multiple climate shocks and violence between al-Shabaab, Amisom and the Somali national forces. Last year alone, more than 100,000 people arrived in the capital, many of them returnees from refugee camps in Kenya and Yemen.Nationally, over 2.6 million Somalis are displaced within the country, with Mogadishu hosting the largest concentration of people forced from their homes. Many in the city have not had a permanent home since the civil war broke out in 1991.However, with funding from donors including the UK government and EU, the local authority has been trying to strengthen its urban resilience capacity to absorb and integrate the city’s mass displacement camps. The Mogadishu municipality established a dedicated durable solutions unit in the mayor’s office and last year developed a policy for internally displaced people.Somalia’s overall humanitarian situation remains critical, with more than 5 million people in need of assistance according to figures jointly released by the UN and federal government of Somalia. The recent flooding in many parts of the country, which affected over half a million people, has compounded the already dire humanitarian crisis.Last Monday, the durable solutions unit launched a five-year strategy to address the growing number of displaced people in the region.“The strategy over the next five years focuses on strengthening local government to respond to the basic and protection needs of its citizens in good time, with adequate resources and be accountable to the people,” said Ali.However, the greatest immediate uncertainty for people displaced to Mogadishu remains forceful evictions, since most are staying on private land. Last year alone, more than 100,000 people were pushed off temporary settlements.“We hope to ensure that even in the first year of the strategy, we see a minimum of 30,000 people who are now displaced move out of the displacement towards development,” said Ali, speaking at the launch event.“The biggest challenge we have in Mogadishu is that the majority of the investment goes into aid and handouts. I don’t think that is an effective way of utilising hundreds of millions of dollars and having to see the conditions we have in the camps.“So it is really important to pull all these resources to have one common output. We hope to have more engagements and discussions with our international partners to ensure that we are all working for the same goal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d77c9a350bd77478321525a09eed8cc6af38f3/0_517_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcc7368196d4b681607e118575c12f79","title":"how has your workplace treated bereaved parents","story":"As paid leave for bereaved parents is being introduced under Jack’s Law, we want to hear what parents experienced at work after they lost a childBereaved parents are now entitled to two weeks’ paid leave from work under the new Jack’s Law.We want to hear from bereaved parents who had to juggle the grief, trauma and practicalities of their child’s death with the demands of their employers.

I would have told you how I could never give up cheese and how I worried about a vegan diet being healthy. I knew that they weren’t the strongest nor the most informed of reasons, so I would have added that I only bought meat when I could afford to buy organic and British, and always bought free-range eggs. I would have wanted you to know I was informed about what was “good” or “bad” farming practice, and I shopped accordingly.I had been a vegetarian on and off since I was a teenager, and cared deeply about the planet. I recycled diligently, carried a reusable water bottle, signed petitions to address the climate disaster and joined protests. I bought cruelty-free makeup, was fervently against animal testing. I was a conscious and conscientious shopper and consumer: I considered the planet when I made choices.For almost my whole life I had been concerned about the planet. As a child, I’d lecture my hairspray-wielding nan about CFCs in primary school I held a bake sale to raise money for the RSPB, the British bird-protection charity, after the Shetland oil disaster in 1993. I was mindful of the environment, and proud of it.Just not mindful enough to make a huge lifestyle change that would be disruptive. Even these days, veganism is frequently inconvenient in that you are always having to check packaging (items you think are safe may have changed their ingredients), trust other people when they are preparing food for you and check everywhere you go in advance for vegan options.So how did I end up a vegan? It all started when I met my friend Sophie’s partner, Rey. We were having a barbecue in Burgess park in south London, and Sophie and I had to wait to eat because Rey and his friends wanted to cook first as they were vegan. They weren’t righteous or aggressive about our food choices, and we didn’t roll our eyes or make jokes about theirs. We had a nice day out.When Sophie and Rey announced they were expecting a baby, she told me she was going vegan, and would raise their child as a vegan. I’m embarrassed about it now, but I was concerned – all my knowledge of veganism came from random snippets of internet lore. What about calcium? What about protein? What about vitamins? Wasn’t it dangerous? Sophie very patiently told me what she knew, and directed me to look things up for myself.So, I did visiting websites, reading leaflets, watching documentaries and filling in the gaps of my knowledge. What I learned started to stick: I became vegetarian again, lapsed and then went back to it. I couldn’t reconcile what I had learned about the realities of the meat and dairy industries with the person I believed myself to be. I asked Sophie – for the first time – why she decided to become a vegan. She wasn’t like me, a so-called advocate for the planet and animal rights. In fact, she was probably the last person I’d expect to become a vegan. “Because I don’t need to eat meat, eggs or dairy,” she told me. “Things don’t have to suffer or die for me to live well.”That was the moment it clicked. Consuming meat and dairy was admitting I was OK with animals suffering and dying for my pleasureconveniencesurvival. But I could choose something different. So I did.I became vegan two years ago. Of course, I am in a position where being a vegan is easy: no food allergies or relevant health issues, enough money to buy speciality vegan ingredients to liven things up, no dependents, time to cook. The impact that it has had on me has been huge. I have seen an improvement in my overall health – an unexpected benefit tighter friendships with vegan friends (it’s the new smoking in terms of social connection). Before I became vegan, I was never much of a cook, but now it has become a hobby. I love experimenting and finding ways of “veganising” food I used to eat.More than that, it has begun to change every aspect of how I live as I try to always minimise suffering, and do my best for the planet. I am lucky to live in a town with eco-friendly refill shops. I have started making my own body moisturiser, cleaning spray, laundry detergent and “toilet fizzers” to cut down on disposable plastics and chemicals. I question where things I buy come from: who made them? How did they get here? How long will they last? I am trying to be a better consumer, even if it is inconvenient sometimes.In the end, what it came down to was having the courage of my convictions to embrace veganism. Now I am proud to be walking the walk.Hold Back the Tide by Melinda Salisbury is published by Scholastic in March (£7.99).

But when it comes to healthy skin, eyes and having bags of energy, the research tells another storyBefore you read this article, can I just check you’ve drunk enough water today? You might want to refill your bottle because, remember, if you wait until you feel thirsty, you may already be dehydrated. No one is sure where this advice came from, but it’s all over the internet.As we get older, our sense of thirst can get fuzzier and that is when dehydration can become a threat. It is a similar story for children, too. So perhaps the advice to drink water before you feel thirsty was originally aimed at parents and the elderly but now healthy adults are putting away gallons of water in a quest to be their best selves.There is a dearth of facts when it comes to hydration. Pharmaceutical companies aren’t interested in researching the benefits of a free resource and dehydration isn’t a pressing public health issue requiring government funding. This leaves a profitable grey area for the drinks industry to exploit. Water is, it would have us believe, a purifying fast-track to glowing skin, bright eyes and bags of energy. Galloway says detoxing with water is “a load of rubbish. Your kidneys do a very good job of sorting out what you need to retain and what you need to get rid of.”Will water make your skin better? While dehydration isn’t good for your skin, says Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist and honorary senior lecturer at the University of Manchester, “once you hit a certain level of fluid intake, providing you are healthy, any excess water will be peed out.”That is, unless you drink more than you can pee. Amanda Burls, an emeritus professor of public health at City, University of London, warns that drinking too much water can kill. Water intoxication occurs when the amount of electrolytes in the body becomes imbalanced by excessive water intake, disrupting brain function.Dehydration is said to be the most common cause of headaches and in 2015, Burls wrote a critical appraisal of the evidence. She concluded: “Chronic mild dehydration may trigger headaches. Increased water intake could help. A small trial shows modest benefit however, a larger, methodologically sound, randomised controlled trial is needed to confirm efficacy.” There is that grey area again.In the US, popular advice is to drink eight, 8-ounce glasses of water – about 2 litres – a day: the “8x8 rule”that originated from a recommendation by the nutritionist Dr Fredrick J Stare in 1974 (he actually suggested six to eight glasses).In the UK, the NHS recommends six to eight glasses, or up to 1.2 litres of “fluids” daily, pointing out that we obtain fluids from food. But it is the 8x8 rule that has become a health-goal meme with “the 8x8 challenge”.How much you need to drink is governed by how active you are, the weather and your physiology. Tellingly, if you seek water-consumption advice from a quietly reputable US source such as Harvard Medical School, instead of the 8x8 rule, you get “four to six cups” a day for healthy adults and all beverages count, even diuretics such as coffee, tea and booze. Don’t they make us pee more so we end up dehydrated?In 2016, Galloway tested the hydrating potential of a range of drinks and found a litre of beer was no less hydrating than a litre of water. Similarly, a litre of instant coffee, containing 212mg of caffeine, was as hydrating as water. Milk was even more hydrating, and effective as a hydration solution for people with diarrhoea. While not a green-light to binge on high-calorie drinks, it’s good to know that a cup of tea or half a lager still count as water intake.How many of us are seriously dehydrated? No one knows but Galloway once studied fluid intake among workers in a Cardiff call centre and found that, to keep their ratings up, many would restrict their fluid intake to avoid loo breaks. “We imagine similar behaviour with long-distance lorry drivers,” he says. If we’re ingesting enough water, he adds, we should probably be going to the loo “somewhere between five and seven times a day”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90433d3c03860fe314f70ff0a7be1d77aab99f72/0_129_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a7409b80c7d30d104042c2d7b6591aa","title":"if i sell a buy to let property and buy another can i defer cgt","story":"A landlord appears to be hoping he can claim business asset roll-over relief to delay paying taxQ If I sell a buy-to-let property and immediately use proceeds to buy another, is the payment of capital gains tax deferred?SKA Short answer: no. You are clearly hoping that selling a buy-to-let property and buying another would make you eligible to claim business asset roll-over relief but it doesn’t. Roll-over relief lets you put off paying any capital gains tax (CGT) due on the gain from the sale of a business asset until you sell the business asset that you bought to replace it but only – among other things – if you are trading. And HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs (HMRC) doesn’t consider investing in a buy-to-let property as trading.HMRC does, however, have special rules that mean that if you make money from furnished holiday lettings you would be eligible to claim roll-over relief if you sold a holiday let and bought another one. To count as a furnished holiday letting – and so qualify for roll-over relief – the property must be furnished and available for letting for at least 210 days in the tax year and let as holiday accommodation for at least 105 days. More information on who can claim the relief – and how to do it – is available in Helpsheet 290: Business Asset Roll-over Relief published by HMRC.

The site had been evacuated by the Nazis just days earlier. Thus ended the largest mass murder in a single location in human history. Precise numbers are still debated, but according to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, the German SS systematically killed at least 960,000 of the 1.1 million to 1.3 million Jews sent to the camp. Other victims included approximately 74,000 Poles, 21,000 Roma, 15,000 Soviet PoWs and at least 10,000 from other nationalities.

A clock counting down the last hour will be projected on to No 10 Downing Street, and Nigel Farage will host a celebration in Parliament Square where flagpoles will fly union jacks.But there will be nothing like the torchlight procession that marked the august occasion on 1 January 1973 when the prime minister Edward Heath was joined in Brussels by his predecessors Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home and a chorus of leaders from across the political ide to witness the accession of the UK into the European Economic Community.Friday will mark the start of what is likely to be an uphill battle to get a trade deal done by the end of the year, not to mention all the non-trade issues that must also be resolved including security and intelligence cooperation, fisheries, data, education and research collaboration. Yes. Although everyday life will remain the same and the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union until the end of the year as part of transition arrangements, the withdrawal agreement will be a legally binding international treaty. It carries sanctions for any “backsliding or half measures”, as Michel Barnier’s adviser Stefaan de Rynck pointed out last week in London. We know little of the plans for the negotiations, and parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit has been restricted. The House of Lords EU committee has invited but failed to get Stephen Barclay to appear to explain the next stages, sources say.“The UK is five days away from entering into a highly complex and potentially extensive set of negotiations with the EU, and from entering into quite an elaborate joint institutional architecture with the EU to manage the withdrawal agreement. But we know little in detail about how either of these are going to work on the UK side, in terms of institutions and process,” says Brigid Fowler, a senior researcher with the Hansard Society.While business has been clamouring for the government to reveal its Brexit vision beyond the joint aspiration of a tariff-free, quota-free deal, little is known about Boris Johnson’s specific goals.Johnson is doing everything he can to expunge the word Brexit from the British lexicon. He has already reduced parliamentary scrutiny of the next phase, and his government has given only clues as to what the goals and red lines in negotiations will be.Negotiating mandates setting out wishlists and red lines are usually published by both sides before they enter into trade talks. Until Sunday, when the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr that they would be published, it had not been clear that Johnson would do so at all.The prime minister is expected to give further clues in a keynote speech in the next fortnight, but parliament’s involvement in approving the negotiating mandate was removed from the Brexit bill.“Essentially, the government seems to be planning to rely on normal mechanisms for ministerial accountability to parliament. These put the government in control of what information is made public and when,” says Fowler.A reshuffle is expected in early February and some departments are expected to be axed. Barclay’s Brexit department will close on Friday and there could be changes to the function of the Treasury, the Department for International Trade, the Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.Michael Gove, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, continues to head a special Exiting the EU operation committee, known as XO, and is expected to continue to have a key role in the next phase.HMRC will be one of the key cogs in the Brexit chain as work must start urgently on the complex arrangements for Northern Ireland that will affect all businesses trading on both sides of the Irish Sea. Expect an early clash between the EU and Johnson, who has repeatedly claimed there will be no checks on goods, in contradiction of the withdrawal agreement.New border systems will be needed for the rest of the UK, and the EU and HMRC will be frustrated in designing them until the shape of the deal is known, possibly not until the summer. HMRC is short of key personnel and recently advertised for a deputy director to take charge of EU exit, who “will be responsible for providing the strategic direction for the project, delivering all the operational, communications and business changes needed in readiness for the UK’s exit.”A former head of HMRC has said it could take five years to get the sort of IT system proposed for Northern Ireland up and running.Expect plenty of sabre-rattling on both sides, but negotiations are unlikely to begin before March. The European commission kicked off its 30-stage process in agreeing its negotiating goals before Christmas and these are expected to be signed off by member states at a meeting on 25 February.David Frost, who replaced Oliver Robbins as the chief negotiator, is expected to lead a team of about 30 calling on expert knowledge from civil servants and trade experts. Some have suggested the government should hire as many as possible from the Canadian team that sealed Canada’s new deal with the EU.Under the withdrawal agreement, a joint committee of EU and UK representatives to oversee implementation of the treaty can sit from 1 February.While the powers of the committee are known, we know very little else. The appointments process, the size of the committee and how often it will meet has yet to be disclosed. One senior source said the committee would not be as influential as speculated.This remains the single most contentious part of the Brexit deal because of the checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. De Rynck said last week that the EU and the UK would have to be “very disciplined” if they were to get a new system for trading in Northern Ireland ready for 31 December.Brussels and Irish political leaders are already alarmed by Johnson’s repeated declarations that there will be no checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, even though some of these will be mandatory.Helen McEntee, Ireland’s minister for European affairs contradicted him directly on Sunday telling Sky News’s Sophy Ridge: “There will be no checks on the island of Ireland, we’ve been very clear on this.”Underneath the joint committee will be a specialised committee and working advisory group to establish the Northern Ireland protocol.Northern Ireland businesses have urged the government to set up the working group urgently so that the detail of the checks can be determined quickly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youMore than 1,280 infected and 18 cities in lockdown in China as officials try to stem spread of virus which has reached Europe, the US and Australia.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside\u0026nbspChina, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, with the 14 people tested for the virus all proving negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected.\u0026nbspThere were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World\u0026nbspHealth\u0026nbspOrganization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital.Japan has chartered evacuation flights to take out 560 Japanese citizens who are confirmed in Hubei and the US consulate in Wuhan is arranging a charter flight on Tuesday to evacuate its personnel and some other Americans.Asked if he supported flying Britons back from Wuhan, and elsewhere, Hunt told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think I would be very sympathetic and I’m sure the Foreign Office would be too.”He added: “This is a very difficult time of year for the NHS – it is the most difficult time. But, again, my experience is that the NHS does know how to cope with these kinds of emergencies.”“IThe thing that will be difficult is the knock-on impact on other NHS services,” he said.“It would be very, very challenging for the NHS in terms of the regular workload but I have absolutely no doubt that, when it comes to doing what comes to necessary to isolate the virus and keep the public safe, our doctors and nurses will do exactly what they need to do.”The World Health Organisation is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.UK in China, the official Twitter account of Britain’s embassy in Beijing, tweeted: “We are working to make available an option for British nationals to leave Hubei province.”Providing details of a 24-hour helpline British nationals could use if they required require assistance, it added it was continuing to monitor developments closely and was in close touch with Chinese authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3d566ce49228eb66532b2ed46dcfcc0b171f113/0_0_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7900101566aa4f2d48f6dc7ec4d0a64","title":"english councils set to miss carbon emission targets","story":"Despite their climate pledges, many local authorities do not even know how much carbon they produceMany councils in England don’t know how much energy they use, a new survey reveals. The findings make it “inconceivable” that they will become carbon neutral within 30 years, as the government has mandated.ECA energy adviser Luke Osborne said the findings were “highly concerning”. Without immediate changes, “it is inconceivable that councils are going to become carbon neutral in less than 30 years”, he said.Of the 49 councils in the survey that stated they would be carbon neutral by 2030, 11 do not know their current carbon footprint.Council buildings pump out large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2). On average, a council HQ building emits 1,234 tonnes of CO2 a year, according to ECA. Overall, English council headquarters emit more than 250,000 tonnes of CO2 a year – the equivalent of 150,000 return flights from London to New York.Many councils have older, energy inefficient buildings, said Osborne, but there are simple measures that could be implemented quickly, such as switching to LED lighting and monitoring occupancy levels. “There is a lot of rhetoric out there, but very few action plans,” he said.But experts say councils are still not doing enough, due to government cuts and the lack of national standards on climate action. “There are some brilliant plans, but they tend to be in the larger metropolitan areas, driven by local leaders and metro mayors,” said Jess Britton, a research fellow at Exeter University. “Declaring a climate emergency and having a realistic plan are two hugely different things.”Britton’s research into local climate strategies includes a call for a new national framework on climate action, which she said would enable councils to bring local organisations together to tackle the crisis. Environmental law firm ClientEarth said last September that dozens of councils were set to miss the government’s net-zero target for 2050 and warned of a collective failure by local authorities across England to plan adequately for climate change. Council climate pledges have to jostle with local development demands. Manchester city council’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2038, for example, has not only been criticised for being unambitious, but explicitly excludes Manchester Airport, which is part-owned by the council, and where a new £50m car park is being planned.  Last week the Local Government Association, which represents local authorities, held its first climate emergency conference for councils. Chaitanya Kumar, head of climate and energy at the Green Alliance thinktank, said government cuts have made it difficult for councils to tackle the climate crisis, despite growing pressure from citizens to act. “Very, very few authorities have the resources, financial, technical or otherwise, to make the changes they need,” he said. Councils are concerned about the imposition of any statutory duty to act over the climate crisis unless they are also given additional resources, he added. This weekend, the first-ever UK citizens’ climate assembly took place, at which 110 people gathered to come up with a plan to tackle global heating and meet the government’s 2050 target. It remains to be seen how the national assembly will marry up with various local groups being convened in places such as Devon and Oxford, said Britton.

As a member of Team USA he won gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. His 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in 2006 is the second-highest single-game total in NBA history. In his final game in 2016 he scored 60 points against the Utah Jazz, the most of any player in his last contest.On Saturday night LeBron James passed Bryant to become the third all-time leading scorer in league history, which Bryant celebrated with a tweet congratulating his former opponent and Olympic teammate.A titanic figure who inspired a generation of basketball players nationally and internationally, Bryant made his debut in 1996 at 18 and played 20 seasons for the Lakers before retiring. Bryant and the center Shaquille O’Neal led the Lakers to the remarkable feat of winning three consecutive titles from 1999-2002 – something accomplished by just two other franchises – and won two more titles between 2008-2010 after O’Neal’s departure. After his retirement, Bryant secured himself as a Los Angeles legend and one of the most iconic athletes in world history.His stardom reached well beyond Los Angeles, as he led the league in jersey sales five times over the course of his career and is believed to have sold more jerseys internationally than every NBA player except Michael Jordan. The son of Joe “Jelly Bean” Bryant, who played in the NBA for eight seasons before becoming a star in Italy, Kobe Bryant was arguably the most worldly of any NBA star in history – he could confidently conduct interviews in Spanish and Italian – and was instrumental in raising the sport’s international profile.His international popularity may have even dwarfed his national celebrity, as he was routinely met by mobs of fans – he once had to escape a reported 15,000 adoring supporters when landing in China for an appearance in the late 2000s – wherever he travelled.Within the game Bryant will be remembered as one of basketball’s most ferocious competitors, tireless workers and demanding teammates. With an intense, often ruthless insistence on attention to detail and fundamental soundness, Bryant’s mastery of basketball mechanics – proper defensive positioning, sound mid-range jump shooting and unparalleled toughness – made him one of the game’s most admired players in an era dominated by Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan.Much of Bryant’s appeal to aspiring athletes came from what he called “The Mamba Mentality”, which Bryant famously described as “if you see me in a fight with a bear, pray for the bear”. His singular obsession with discipline, winning and enormous personality made him one of the most polarising players of his time – he endured public fallouts with O’Neal, the coach Phil Jackson and several onerous contract negotiations with Lakers management. His public legacy was chequered by a 2003 sexual assault scandal, when a 19-year-old hotel employee accused Bryant of raping her in a hotel room. Bryant admitted to committing adultery and issued an apology to the accuser but denied the assault allegations. The criminal charges were eventually dropped and the parties settled in a civil lawsuit.What was never questioned was his devotion to the game of basketball, the admiration that he inspired across the league and the love he had for his four daughters, one of whom, Gianna, died with him, aged 13. He memorialised his career in his Academy Award winning short, Dear Basketball, and became one of the game’s most vocal proponents in retirement. He became central in the development of his daughter Gianna’s career, serving as a coach and mentor to her teams and emerged as a major influence in women’s basketball.Gianna is the second of his four daughters, between Natalia, 17, three-year-old Bianka and seven-month-old Capri.Bryant routinely visited the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks as an informal advisor and worked with other women at all levels of basketball. One of the last viral photos of Bryant was him offering pointers to Gianna, herself a promising teenage prospect, during a game last month.Bryant’s loss is a seismic one not just for basketball but for a generation of Los Angeles natives whose bedroom walls were adorned with his posters and the countless iniduals he inspired over the course of his 20-year career. The loss of a legend who matured from basketball superstar to devoted family man (husband of Vanessa) to global basketball ambassador is a palpable tragedy that left the world shocked, grieving and reminiscing about the thrills he delivered over the course of three decades. As the longtime NBA coach David Fizdale told ESPN on Sunday : “The Lakers are the heartbeat of LA and Kobe Bryant was the blood running through it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01ab048d62ec35c148dd3965f1eb1b7db1712360/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc48966f0b57c388effb07e181e65bfe","title":"tell us about your favourite kobe bryant moment","story":"We would like to hear from you about the NBA great, who has died aged 41Kobe Bryant, the former LA Lakers star and one of the greatest basketball players of all time, has died in a helicopter crash in Los Angeles county.Over a career ning 20 seasons, Bryant won five NBA championships and two Olympic gold medals. He was also named an All-Star 18 times before retiring in 2016 as the league’s third-highest all-time scorer.The NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, said: “He will be remembered most for inspiring people around the world to pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of their ability”.“Kobe was a leader of our game, a mentor to both male and female players,” said Magic Johnson, another Laker great, while civil rights activist Jesse Jackson said: “Kobe was instrumental to so many people.

But here is a question that may fox some of you: name a sports star who has been banned recently in Britain for doping? Go on, have a think. And no, Tyson Fury doesn’t count given his ended in 2017.Does London City Royals’ US-born basketball guard AJ Roberts, who received a two-year punishment for cannabis, ring a bell? Or Henry Hadfield, a League 2 North rugby union player who also got two years for a prohibited stimulant he insists was in a pre-workout drink? No? Me neither.That, I suspect, is why many athletes and anti-doping activists were so furious at reports last week that the Ukad chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, was apparently reluctant to hand over Mo Farah’s blood and urine samples to the World Anti-Doping Agency without “credible evidence” of banned substances. Their concern wasn’t just that Ukad is losing the war on doping, but that it wasn’t even fully engaged in the battle.Jessica Judd, who competed for Britain over 5,000m at the recent world athletics championships, was blunter than most. After admitting that she was “embarrassed” by Ukad’s stance, she then warned that athletics “is dying a drug-fuelled death”.Others flagged up the fact that Ukad refused to hand over Farah’s samples when the US Anti-Doping Agency began investigating the Nike Oregon Project in 2015, where the Briton was training at the time. And nor did it speak to the German journalist Hajo Seppelt when he claimed that an unnamed British athlete had taken EPO in Kenya. Ukad’s response – that it worked closely with Usada and conducted its own 14-month investigation into Seppelt’s claims – was met with scepticism.Ukad was even trolled by Russia, which warned that its stance was “creating a wall of mistrust in the country’s anti-doping system and, accordingly, its athletes”. You might raise an eyebrow. But imagine if the Russian Anti-Doping Agency withheld samples from athletes who worked with a banned coach. Wouldn’t Ukad be sceptical too?Yet all this negative publicity was easily avoidable. It all started 10 days ago when I asked Sapstead about Farah’s samples and the Wada investigation into the Nike Oregon Project. I expected a factual but formulaic response. Something like: “We haven’t been asked yet, but if they come knocking of course we would help.” Instead she performed the PR equivalent of bicycle kicking an innocuous cross into her own net.Only days later did Ukad release a statement saying that Wada hadn’t actually asked for the samples. It also might have made sense to point out that a new, more sophisticated drugs test, which is said to allow blood doping to be identified several months after banned performance-enhancing drugs such as EPO are used, is being developed. That is potentially very significant. As things stand, if someone microdoses EPO it can be undetectable to testers within hours.Sapstead’s comments came at the launch of a detailed and impressive Ukad report on the rise of steroids in British gyms. During her presentation she also highlighted Ukad’s education programme, which for some athletes starts as young as 10. No one doubts this is needed, but it is hardly a core function. Anti-doping chiefs should wake up desperate to stop cheats, eat their three square meals thinking of ways to catch cheats, and sleep uneasily if they fail. If not, they are not doing it right.Towards the end of Sapstead’s presentation I asked her how confident she was that all British Olympians heading to Tokyo could be trusted. “I am never going to pin my colours to the mast and say all athletes are clean,” she replied. “We have seen time and again that sophisticated cheats can beat the system. To prove that someone is clean you would literally have to be testing them every single day.”I don’t disagree. Sapstead did promise that Ukad would “move into the 21st century a bit more” by using more data profiling to catch cheats, but admitted that would take time, effort and money. How much is unclear.Ukad’s budget is £11m a year but its three investigators are stretched as it is. It also has far fewer powers than its equivalents in Austria, Italy and Germany, where it is a criminal offence not only to traffic and supply performance enhancing drugs but also to dope and elite athletes can be punished financially for sporting fraud. Increasingly I am persuaded that Britain should follow suit.“The constant discussion we have in the organisation is about this chicken and egg,” Sapstead admitted. “Do we not get the findings because we think we are doing a good job with education, and the athletes are generally clean? Or is it because the athletes are sophisticated, or we are not doing the testing in the right places?”The quiet tragedy is that a decade after Ukad was founded, we are still no nearer to knowing the answer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8ea6f61f5632ba6d579944253d70d71b4713232/0_272_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3c4aa122b9090776a3df549cd9ba35e","title":"kobe bryant a life in pictures","story":"A look back at one of the most storied careers in NBA history, following the death of the former LA Lakers basketball player in a helicopter crash"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e1fe5eb952edd0037b5d1cfb5e2b4f4f5d287a5/0_22_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=953b91a601c7a2458b4e76b4be81c328","title":"australian open nadal v kyrgios plus zverev and kerber in action live","story":"Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 6-5* Nick Kyrgios: The stress is rising and it’s fair to say that Nick Kyrgios is no longer having fun. After a correct challenge with Nadal leading 30-15, the Australian began to mouth off at umpire James Keothavong as he criticised the officiating. As Kyrgios seethed, Nadal produced a big serve to complete an uncomplicated service hold. A tiebreak looms.Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 5-5* Nick Kyrgios: This time, it was Kyrgios’ turn to face a nerve-wracking point on his serve at 30-30. He shrugged off any nerves and crushed two unreturned serves to hold.Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 5-4* Nick Kyrgios: Incredible. Nadal survives the toughest hold of the set. Kyrgios dragged Nadal back to deuce from 40-15 and then he beautifully opened up the court and before missing an easy forehand. After scuppering a third break point, Kyrgios once had Nadal on the ropes at deuce. This time, Nadal desperately defended every last shot and when Kyrgios unloaded on a forehand down the line on the run, he flipped the point with an incredible crosscourt forehand in response, ending the point in one attacking blow. On his fourth game point, Nadal finally held to move to within a game of the set.Nadal had lost 4 points on serve all set. He just lost 4 in one game. The pressure is rising.Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 *4-4 Nick Kyrgios: That was some hold from Nick Kyrgios. At 15-0, Kyrgios attempted an underarm serve that landed in the net. Nadal was all over the following second serve, ending the point with a violent forehand down the line winner and then riding the momentum to 30-40.Down break point and after a heavy-handed drop volley on the previous point, Kyrgios scuppered the danger with an absurd, gorgeous dropshot off his serve. From deuce, two huge serves. Danger averted. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 4-3* Nick Kyrgios: At the moment, Nick Kyrgios is enjoying this match as much as the fans who paid to watch. As Nadal drilled a 141kmh backhand passing shot past him before holding to 15 with a serve and forehand combo, he was laughing. Both players are playing extremely well now and showing the breadth of their hand skills.Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 3-2* Nick Kyrgios: After a series of quick holds, Nadal inched ahead with another love hold. At 40-0 and on a short ball, Kyrgios feigned to hammer the ball away before throwing in a drop shot. Nadal chased it down and responded with a slick, angled no-look passing shot winner. Kyrgios was laughing as he returned to his chair, Nadal was not.Let’s have a score update:Over on Margaret Court Arena, Angelique Kerber and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova are in the midst of a ridiculous, high quality slugfest. Kerber just saved three set points, the final saved with a sweeping forehand combination, to push them into a second set tiebreak. Pavlyuchenkova has hit 52 winners, 28 unforced errors and she’s losing.On Melbourne Arena, Alexander Zverev is well on his way to reaching the quarters without dropping a set. He leads Andrey Rublev 6-4 *4-3.Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 *1-1 Nick Kyrgios: The pair opened with two holds, but the holds could not have been more different. While Nadal’s hold was to love, Kyrgios watched a Nadal backhand down the line passing shot fly past him for 0-30. How did Kyrgios respond to the 0-30 deficit? He crushed a forehand down the line winner at 0-30, then reeled off three unreturned serves in succession to hold.Alexander Zverev is having a lovely time on Melbourne Arena. He now leads Andrey Rublev 6-4 *1-0 with a break in the second set.According to Mats Wilander on Eurosport, a woman in the crowd kept on calling Nadal’s name between points. Kyrgios’ response? “He’s married”Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 Nick Kyrgios: Kyrgios levels! As Nadal tookhis final stand in the second set, the game opened with long, gruelling rallies. Nadal dumped a backhand into the net at 15-15, but then he responded at 30-15 by sweeping into the net behind a huge backhand down the line. Kyrgios shook off the pressure without thinking twice, slamming down two aces in a row to hold and take the set. Game on.Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-5* Nick Kyrgios: As expected, Nadal has recovered from the earlier blip and he sealed another hold with a bread-and-butter serve and forehand combination. Kyrgios will attempt to serve out the set.Rafael Nadal 6-3 *2-5 Nick Kyrgios: The tennis has become obscenely good here. Kyrgios opened with a sickly sweet angled drop volley and then he immediately returned to the net and dispatched another lovely drop volley. Kyrgios closed off the hold to love with a final huge forehand, backed up with another pointedly loud and long grunt. He stands one game from levelling the match at one set all.Rafael Nadal 6-3 2-4* Nick Kyrgios: Nadal responds with a quick, businesslike love hold and a running forehand winner so good that it had Kyrgios giggling like a child. This is getting fun.Rafael Nadal 6-3 *1-4 Nick Kyrgios: Absolutely no problems for Kyrgios in this service game. If there was any doubt that the momentum had shifted, he made it clear by opening the game with successive aces and punctuating each with loud, drawn out grunts. Nadal dumped a backhand long on the final point to hand Kyrgios a hopeful love hold.Rafael Nadal 6-3 1-3* Nick Kyrgios: Out of nowhere, Nick Kyrgios breaks! Kyrgios was finally rewarded for his perseverance through his opening service game as Nadal dumped a forehand into the net at 15-15 and then a backhand into the net at 30-30. The rallies are long, gruelling and tactical in these slow conditions and after one such exchange, the Aussie flicked an incredible running passing shot winner past a seething Nadal.On Margaret Court Arena, Angelique Kerber has taken the first set 7-6(5) against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and the score is 2-2 in the second set. Pavluchenkova led 5-2 and played a great set, but the 2016 champion seems to be finding her feet and, most importantly, her grit.Andrey Rublev and Alexander Zverev are just starting on Melbourne Arena. Rublev leads 2-1 on serve.Rafael Nadal 6-3 *1-2 Nick Kyrgios: Kyrgios is looking a lot happier than he was 10 minutes ago. A much better hold from the Aussie he slammed down his 9th ace of the day and dismounted with a drop shot-lob combination, leaping into the air as it landed in. After tossing a bit of abuse towards his camp, he is now laughing and joking with them.Rafael Nadal 6-3 1-1* Nick Kyrgios: After the endless drama on Kyrgios’ serve, Nadal marches through a hold to 15, sealed with an ace down the T. Easy.Rafael Nadal 6-3 *0-1 Nick Kyrgios: Goodness, that was tough. Kyrgios opened up the second set with his back to the wall, Nadal desperate to snatch a break to open the set. Kyrgios immediately fell down double break point before pegging Nadal back to deuce by winning long rally that included a Kyrgios tweener. After a long tug of war, Kyrgios found his magic hands and two beautiful forehand dropshots before closing with an ace. The Aussie could not afford to lose that game.After their win, Coco Gauff and Caty McNally dedicated their celebration to Kobe.Rafael Nadal 6-3 Nick Kyrgios: The world number one takes the first set. Quite a routine set for the Spaniard - he took advantage of one weak service game from the Australian and easily held onto his serve. These slow conditions and aren’t helping Kyrgios, but neither is the opponent across the net.Rafael Nadal *5-3 Nick Kyrgios: After a couple of quick holds from both, Nadal looked to make another move by reaching 15-30 on Kyrgios’ serve. This time, Kyrgios found two important first serves to move up 40-30 before playing a decent drop volley. Nadal chased down the dropshot and sent his response wide, handing Kyrgios another hold. The world number one will serve for the set.You thought the Coco Gauff story was over for another tournament? Think again. 15 year-old Gauff and 18 year old Caty McNally just recovered from a set and break down to defeat the 10th seeds in doubles, Shuko Aoyama and Ena Shibahara, 4-6 7-5 6-3 to reach the first slam quarterfinal of their careers. They will face second seeds Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic.Rafael Nadal 4-1* Nick Kyrgios: Nadal consolidates the break fairly well. The Spaniard opened his service game on fire, with a searing backhand crosscourt winner followed by a forehand down-the-line winner. Kyrgios showed some encouraging signs by pegging him back to 30-30 by grinding through a couple of physical points and forcing a Nadal error. At 30-30, Nadal found two great unreturned first serves to seal the hold.Here are Nadal’s comments on Kyrgios from Saturday. Nadal was asked if he likes the Australian:I don’t know him personally, honestly, to have a clear opinion. Yeah, my answer is better to... It’s clear, of course, that when he does stuff that in my opinion is not good, I don’t like. When he plays good tennis and he shows passion for this game, he is a positive player for our tour, and I want my tour bigger, not smaller. So the players who make the tour bigger are important for the tour. When he’s ready to play his best tennis and play with passion, is one of these guys. When he’s doing the other stuff, of course I don’t like.Rafael Nadal *3-1 Nick Kyrgios: Nadal breaks first. The good news for Kyrgios is that he slammed down two aces and a service winner to lead 40-15, but otherwise that was a dire service game. From 40-15 up, he dumped two consecutive drop shots into the net. After an ace to generate a third game point, he missed two easy backhands in a row. On the third deuce, he missed an easy open court backhand. He then lost his serve with a backhand well long. A bit of a mess. “F*ck, man,” he says.Rafael Nadal 2-1* Nick Kyrgios. This time, a quick love hold from Nadal to retain his early lead. Some great serving from the world number one to reach 40-0 and then he closed it off with a moment of pure class, hooking a gorgeous angled forehand for a clean winner while on the run.Rafael Nadal *1-1 Nick Kyrgios. A quick hold for Kyrgios to open his account. Nadal very quickly showed that he will be going after his forehand whenever he can at 30-15 he crushed an inside out forehand that just skidded out. Kyrgios sealed his first hold of the day with a service winner. There will be many more.Rafael Nadal 1-0* Nick Kyrgios: The world number one seals his opening hold, but it wasn’t easy. Nadal double faulted twice in the game, including at 40-30 to bring them back to deuce. From deuce, he found a big serve and then forced a Kyrgios error with a firm crosscourt backhand to hold.There is no love lost between these two and Kyrgios has always been very happy to discuss that. Here are Kyrgios’ comments on Nadal during his wide-ranging interview with Ben Rothenberg on the No Challenges Remaining podcast last year.“He’s my polar opposite. Literally my polar opposite. And he’s super salty.“When he wins it’s fine, he won’t say anything bad, he’ll credit the opponent - ‘he competed well today, he’s a great player’ - but then as soon as I beat him, it’s just like ‘he has no respect for me, my fans and no respect to the game’. I’m like ‘what are you talking about? I literally played this way that I beat you the other previous times and nothing changed’.The players are on-court. Kyrgios is a huge NBA fan and he unsurprisingly warmed up wearing Kobe Bryant’s laker jersey. As he sat down in his chair, Kyrgios was crying.So, where will this match be won? Rafael Nadal narrowly leads the head to head 4-3 with the pair splitting their matches in 2019. Kyrgios famously toppled Nadal in Acapulco, with the Aussie playing an underarm serve and complaining about Nadal taking his time between points. Nadal followed up a few months later with a statement win at Wimbledon. Ever since Kyrgios burst onto the scene at Wimbledon in 2014, shocking Nadal in four stunning sets in the fourth round, this has been one of the truly gripping matchups of the past 6 years.There is no big match player like Nick Kyrgios. On any given day against a lowly ranked opponent, he could find himself drawn into endless rallies but he almost always elevates his game against the elite. His first priority will be to take care of his service games, but he will also be looking to keep points as short as he possibly can. He will flatten out his groundstrokes and thump winners off both wings and he will throw in a constant variety of drop shots and net forays to keep Nadal off balance.For Nadal, serving well will also be key and so it’s helpful that he is in the serving form of his life. He will also look to slip into the net when he can and he spend a lot of time working on Kyrgios’ backhand and moving him side-to-side when he can. He will certainly look to be aggressive and open up his forehand down the line, but he will also force Kyrgios to be perfect, to always find the huge forehand winner or perfect dropshot on the biggest points. If Kyrgios is not perfect, he will lose.A solid upset to start the morning as Stan Wawrinka takes out US Open finalist Daniil Medvedev. A result like this has been coming for the three-time slam champion in recent months. He has played well for a while now but he just hasn’t quite been able to reach his top level over 5 sets against the very best. He did today.As we wait for the night session to begin, one match is reaching its dramatic conclusion. 2014 champion Stan Wawrinka has rediscovered some vintage form against 4th seed Daniil Medvedev and he currently leads Medvedev by a double break in the fifth set at *5-2. He is on the brink of perhaps his best win since he underwent knee surgery in 2017.Hello! Welcome to day 8 of our Australian Open coverage as the first half of fourth round action comes to an end. Tonight’s session will feature three singles matches: On Melbourne Arena, 22 year-olds Alexander Zverev and Andrey Medvedev will fight to reach the quarters. Rublev has been the in-form player this year and he is currently on a 15 match winning streak having won two tournaments in the first two weeks of the year. On Margaret Court Arena, 2016 champion Angelique Kerber will attempt to return to the quarterfinals when she faces last year’s quarterfinalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who scuppered Karolina Pliskova in the third round.But most eyes will be on Rod Laver Arena as Nick Kyrgios takes on Rafael Nadal in front of his home crowd for the first time. The world number one has mostly coasted through the tournament playing high quality tennis and he still hasn’t dropped a set. Kyrgios arrives in the third Australian Open fourth round with the crowd firmly behind him. He has played well and fought even harder, edging out a 5th set tiebreak win over 16th seed Kharen Khachanov to reach the fourth round. The question is how his body has recovered after the first four and a half hour battle of his career, and if he has recovered, whether it even that be enough to topple the in-form world number one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3886d79e51b791131bef6ebb8fcdb5cdb92256d9/0_423_4222_2533/master/4222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f83c884c8c9d48732ad9f5a8eef4b733","title":"south africa v england fourth test day four live","story":"A couple more before we return. “Hi Adam.” G’day, Peter Salmon. “I think we forget a couple of things when we get cross at batsmen getting out after drinks.

But it isn’t so much Susan from reception as something they know is going to happen at the top of the hour. To that end, I wonder why more hasn’t been done to prepare for the break so they don’t leave the zone? Steve Nicholson is with us as well on players commentating while on the field. “I clearly remember (mid 1960s?) Denis Compton doing this while playing in a televised match between (I think) Old England and the Lords Taverners. Compton (who was obviously long retired from 1st class cricket playing but a regular tv commentator) wore the microphone while he was bowling, and informed viewers what he was intending to do with his next ball. I don’t recall if he also wore it while batting - but in any case, the BBC had probably gone over for the 4.00 race at Catterick by then.”This needs an post all on its own, as I’ll be watching it very closely. “All lovers of round averages need to stop what they are doing a pray to Alistair Cook’s Cricket Gods (TM) that Faf is out for a score of 54,” writes Paul Gilham. “That will leave him with an average of bang on 40. At which point he surely should do the decent thing and bunk the West Indies tests to leave his Test career there.”Yes! Speaking of Cook, in his final innings I spent the better part of a day going back and forth with Andrew Samson as we watched him track to the number he required to guarantee a career average of 45. From memory, that was 80. Of course, he went on to make a lot more than that before he was done. Righto, let’s get though some emails. “This has been done a few times,” Bertie Wooster says of the task linking players from dawn of Test Criket time. “The war is an issue (Hutton is needed there) and then there’s a bit of fiddling in the 70s. I *think* the answer is eleven. Shaw takes you 1877-80, then Grace, then Rhodes. Rhodes played with Ames. Ames played with Hutton. Hutton played with Close. Close played with Woolmer. Woolmer played with Gooch. Gooch played with Thorpe. Thorpe played with Bell. Bell played with Root. That’s 11. Toodle pip.”Beautifully done. Let’s assume Root plays for another eight years? Root might play with... Athers’ son, who is making his way nicely through the junior ranks. Sky Cricket are now showing a package on his 185 at Jo’burg in 1995, if you fancy it.Now to Alistair Connor is ing deep into my mind. “It’s not cricket, it’s an earworm,” he says. “From my youth. You set me off in Over 4 with your need for round numbers and right angles. So here’s your new theme song : Never leaves a gap unfilledAlways pays on timeAlways fits the billHe comes well preparedCube top, squared-offEight corners, 90 degree anglesFlat top, stares straight aheadStock parts, blockheadAs the kids say, I feel... seen. A quirky addition from Mark Slater. “While his test appearances are not likely to have featured in the missing gap mentioned in the 20th over discussion, I think there should be recognition of Fred Titmus of Middlesex and England - who played first class cricket in as many decades as did WG Grace (because Mike Brealey spotted him in the crowd and invited him to bowl on a wet pitch some few years after his official retirement). To think that the powers that be would not allow such a thing to happen nowadays.”If only so! Not quite the same, but always liked the story about the day Harry Redknapp let an angry fan come on a play for West Ham. Brian Withington on drinks-break psychology. “May I be the first to offer advice for any batsman facing a drinks break: ‘Make sure you end up at the non-striker’s end going into the break’. However, we might then need to start investigating the prevalence of run outs the ball before a drinks break, but that’s for another day.”It’s definitely a thing and absolutely shouldn’t be these days. A cheeky lookalike from David Brown before I hit send “Are Rassie Van Dussen and Laurence Fox related?” I feel dirty including the name of the latter in the OBO.29th over: South Africa 90-2 (van der Dussen 39, du Plessis 0) Far more chilled out from RvdD off Root after the loss of Elgar, taking a single into the legside. du Plessis defends the rest. With that, we have reached LUNCH. South Africa are still 376 runs away from their notional target at the end of a hard-fought session, England eight wickets away. But the visitors return to their dressing room on a positive note with Stokes removing Dean Elgar just minutes before the interval. 28th over: South Africa 89-2 (van der Dussen 38, du Plessis 0) I thought that would be lunch but it’s not - we must be making up some time in this session. du Plessis, playing what will probably be his final Test innings on home soil, defends the one delivery he has to deal with to complete the successful Stokes over.The Stokes bouncer does it again! He went at Elgar’s body from the get-go in this spell and gets his wicket with it now. The opener was unable to access his pull shot in time, the hurried stroke instead coming off the splice and back to the bowler. 27th over: South Africa 89-1 (Elgar 24, van der Dussen 38) Lunch time? PARTY TIME! van der Dussen is really going after Root, sweeping him for four then launching him over long on for SIX! Have that! Helped by four byes down the legside earlier in the over, they have reached their 50 partnership in 70 balls. Good times. So, Root’s last three overs in Test cricket have had 54 runs taken off them. 26th over: South Africa 75-1 (Elgar 24, van der Dussen 28) So much for shutting up shop before a break, van der Dussen’s approach is to go through the gears. After taking Root on in the previous over, he’s hammered a stand-and-deliver slap from the crease off Stokes through extra cover, his sixth boundary out of 28 runs. “Good morning Adam (rather early morning in snowy Ottawa).” Welcome aboard, Nicholas von Malzahn. “Easier than Paul Headon’s head-scratcher (over 20): has anyone other than Rhodes played Tests in five different decades? Warm thanks while I’m at it for OBO coverage.”My pleasure. I know that Brian Close and Sachin Tendulkar ned four and Shoaib Malik recently participated in his fourth decade of white-ball cricket for Pakistan. But surely Rhodes stands alone with five. I’ll double check at lunch.25th over: South Africa 69-1 (Elgar 23, van der Dussen 23) Root brings himself on - the only spin option for England this week, of course. van der Dussen starts positively, taking him on with a reverse sweep second ball, striking it expertly down to the rope. He plays an even better stroke later in the set, jumping down the track and getting to the pitch, clipping beautifully out to the midwicket boundary. A third boundary to finish, back to that trusty reverse sweep. After having a lot of trouble against the turning ball last week, the Proteas No3 is backing himself.24th over: South Africa 57-1 (Elgar 23, van der Dussen 11) Stokes is fuller at Elgar this time around, jumping around the wicket to slam a shorter ball in there. They exchange singles behind square to finish. There’ll be four more overs until lunch. “Andrew Milligan’s observations n exact decimals and rounding had me dangerously close to resurrecting last summer’s NRR inspired debate about 0.9 recurring (ie 0.9999... ad infinitum) being exactly equal to one,” writes Ian Forth. “Dangerously close.” I reckon I was on the OBO that day? Let’s steer clear of that for now!23rd over: South Africa 55-1 (Elgar 22, van der Dussen 10) Three maidens on the bounce for England, Curran v RvdD quickly turning into a good little contest.“Your point about batsmen getting out immediately following drinks may not be recorded, but I’d take a stab at once every other innings.” Feels right to me, John Starbuck. “When it happens once, the rest of the side may be more attentive.”It feels like a logical area for a team psychologist to look into. They all have one.22nd over: South Africa 55-1 (Elgar 22, van der Dussen 10) Ben Stokes is into the attack for the first time today. It’s a different approach from the all-rounder to the other seamers used this morning, banging it in at Elgar. But the opener has been around long enough to know full well what was coming, handling it comfortably. “Evening Adam.” A good evening to you, Phil Withall. “With regard to Ian Forth’s 10th over email. One of the few benefits of getting older is the ability to recall obscure things that have little interest to the younger generation. I’m on a mission to befuddle and confuse anyone younger than me with obscure sporting facts, for instance, I believe that Derek Randall was the first on field player to provide live commentary, during a game at Don Valley stadium in Sheffield in the late 1980’s. A game that also included a very young (1819 year old) Sachin Tendulkar.”You might have to define live commentary for me, here? As in, he was mic’ed up? Bob Woolmer and Hansie Cronje tried their own version of that during the 1999 World Cup, you may recall. Always thought it was harsh to crack down on that.21st over: South Africa 55-1 (Elgar 22, van der Dussen 10) Curran gives Rassie something to flick and he takes full advantage, moving into double figures are his reprieve on zero. The all-rounder is still getting a fair bit of conventional swing. “Hi Adam!” Andrew Milligan, welcome to the OBO. “I was intrigued by the discussion of round averages so had a look on statsguru. According to that, Vettori has scored 4531 runs and been out 151 times (174-23).This actually works out as 30.0066. So they are truncating his average to 2dp rather than rounding up to 30.01 which would be the correct thing to do. The most runs scored with a truly exact average I can find is Keppler Wessels with 2788 @ 41 (71 innings 3 not outs).” Controversy! Ian Forth, what say you? One decimal point or two? It is, when you think about it, kinda bonkers that we measure batting averages by two DPs, no?20th over: South Africa 50-1 (Elgar 21, van der Dussen 6) Woakes to van der Dussen, forced to use his bat throughout, giving him nothing. Maiden.“Morning Adam.” Hello, Paul Headon. “Loved your little nugget about Wilf Rhodes. It got me wondering (Knowledge-style) what the smallest number of players is, in a list from first test ever to most recent test for each nation, where each player must have played with or against the preceding player in the list. W.G. Grace to Wilf Rhodes gets you from 1880 to 1930 in one mighty leap, but how many other players are required to cover 1877-1880 and 1930 to 2019? I haven’t got time to research it this morning, but a fun one to throw out to your readers…”Thank you! Yes, we have done this one before. I know that Brian Close and Graham Gooch are involved Alec Stewart and Jimmy Anderson too. There are gaps! One challenge is that Hammond didn’t quite crossover with Close, from memory.19th over: South Africa 50-1 (Elgar 21, van der Dussen 6) The 50 is up for the hosts, Elgar driving nicely past mid-off his fourth boundary of the morning. Curran did beat him on the outside edge earlier in the over - a lovely bit of bowling - but on the whole, he’s looked far more comfortable than has been the case of late.18th over: South Africa 46-1 (Elgar 17, van der Dussen 6) Big Rassie is off his pair with a classy pull shot off Woakes down to the rope, along the turf all the way. Shot. He then pushes a couple behind point to finish. That’s better.“Early play has done nothing to dissipate the after effects of a classic anxiety dream,” writes Brian Withington. Good morning to you. “Report deadline approaching fast, first half written but second half still just section headings with no text. And someone’s debating what shade of paper it should be printed on! I’m sure this has no read across to the cricket whatsoever, and was more likely triggered by my son limping off to A\u0026ampE two weeks before crunch FA Vase 5th round tie. Nothing broken, fingers crossed. A wicket or two now would be nice.”I’m meant to be writing down my dreams at the moment but neglected to do so when starting this OBO earlier. I do know it was equally anxious. Standard!17th over: South Africa 40-1 (Elgar 17, van der Dussen 0) Slammin’ Sam is back to Elgar and nearly completes a tidy maiden himself but going for the bumper to finish, it flies high enough over the lid for a wide to be called. Good set, though.“Good morning Adam, good morning everyone.” My man Greg Hensman! Great to see you pop up in my inbox. “You mention your group-estimation of the Test wickets Broad will finish on. Any thoughts on Anderson (this one might be a bit more tricky, what with managing the body and all)? Will he coast past Kumble? And presumably get nowhere near to Warne (that’d surely be way too much, even for the machine that is Anderson’s body)?”We did do that, but it was one pint later so we were less definitive. We did have him going beyond Kumble. Like Broad, we reckon they will take him to India and Australia but in a squad rotation. That might even apply to his output at home this coming season. Then again, he’ll clean up against the Windies and Pakistan. 16th over: South Africa 39-1 (Elgar 17, van der Dussen 0) ANOTHER big lbw appeal to finish! Umpire Joel Wilson was under pressure having gotten the previous one wrong but made the right decision here - there as an inside edge, which he detected. The end of a superb over from Chris Woakes, a wicket maiden.Malan will be furious with his dismissal, just after the break - how often do you see it? It was Woakes’ fullest delivery this morning. Sure, it did a bit in the air but it was never a delivery he had to play at in the first place. NOT OUT! Excellent review, it’s going over the top. The No3 survives a pair. For now, anyway... IS VAN DER DUSSEN LBW THIRD BALL? He’s given out on the field but after consulting Elgar, it has been sent upstairs for review. Stand by! First ball after the break! Malan has batted well but throwing his hands at a ball outside the off stump, he’s edged Woakes to the big hands of Stokes in the cordon.15th over: South Africa 39-0 (Malan 22, Elgar 17) Wood is hitting the high notes on the radar but Malan really doesn’t seem to mind, playing another really compact shot through cover from four. Not a lot of backswing all timing. A quick single closes out the first hour- positive running. He’s into the 20s. They take a drink. 14th over: South Africa 34-0 (Malan 17, Elgar 17) Woakes is digging into a channel just outside the off stump at Malan for the majority of the over before bringing an off-cutter back, played well to midwicket. He keeps the strike with one to cover.13th over: South Africa 33-0 (Malan 16, Elgar 17) Shot of the morning, Elgar lashing Wood’s first ball through cover point. Not a lot of footwork but he nailed the timing. An encouraging start from a man who could really do with a Leo Sayer. Oh, hold that positive thought: he’s beaten wafting outside the off-stump to finish.“Surely the most famous exact average is G. F. Grace’s 0.0,” notes Richard O’Hagan. “A pair on debut, fell ill during the game and died a fortnight later. It wasn’t his best month.”Cripes. Oh, that gives me an excuse to relay something I found the other day! I’m sure somebody else has written about it before but, well, I’m happy with it. It relates to Wilfred Rhodes. We all know that he was playing Test cricket when he was nearly 53 years old. But how about this. His first Test Match in 1899 was WG Grace’s final outing, at Nottingham against the touring Australians. His last Test, in 1930, was the match where Andrew Sandham made the first triple ton (325) in Test cricket, against the West Indies in Jamaica. Isn’t that cool? 12th over: South Africa 29-0 (Malan 16, Elgar 13) Edge, four! Malan went at the cut with hard hands, angling his bat so the ball went over the cordon. Earlier in the over, he had to get through a shout for leg before from Woakes who jagged back at him off the seam, but it made contact outside the line. A bit more going on now.11th over: South Africa 25-0 (Malan 12, Elgar 13) Wood is sure he has Elgar caught around the corner but it is turned dow! Technology confirms that there is no bat involved, it’s all hipthigh pad. Root, once again, is right not to review. He’s already consistently beyond 90mph, building with each delivery. This’ll be fun.“Morning Adam.” Hello, Chris Dew. “So you like right angles? The hotel 70 degrees in Colwyn Bay was anything but at right angles. Gone now, but I had many lovely afternoon teas there. At least Colwyn Bay still hosts the biannual thrashing of Glamorgan by Lancashire.”We spent a weekend staying in Colwyn Bay (albeit in an Airbnb) just before Christmas, a Babymoon of sorts. Absolutely loved the two brewries and Snowdonia Ale at the Pen y Bryn. Looped around to Conwy, Llandudno, Snowdonia (albeit, without climbing), Angelsey and Denbigh - where many of my family are from. Indeed, that’s where my grandad, the old scallywag, evaded courtmartial after the war and met my nan. In short, can’t wait to get back! 10th over: South Africa 25-0 (Malan 12, Elgar 13) Chris Woakes bowled magnificently in the first innings for limited returns, especially when the game was there to be won on that second afternoon. He’s into the attack now, replacing Sam Curran. He’s right on the button here too. Nice start.“Daniel Vettori has the most number of runs for a test batsman with an ‘exact’ average,” reports Ian Forth. “His is exactly 30.00. I made another slightly pedantic point to someone on a  forum the other day and the reply came ‘You’re old, impotent and out of touch. Comes to us all eventually. There’s always steam trains and writing letters to the local paper. Now I’m going to make cheese scones with my daughter’. I was chortling so much I didn’t even bother reporting her for personal abuse.” Great stat... even better sledge! 9th over: South Africa 24-0 (Malan 12, Elgar 12) Mark Wood it is, to replace Stuart Broad. What a joy he has been to watch bowl, bat and talk over the last couple of weeks. Elgar gets one to begin the spell, out to cover, Malan forced to get out the way of a quick bouncer soon enough. He’s stroking them well this morning though, able to time the quick down the ground for a couple to finish his over. 8th over: South Africa 21-0 (Malan 10, Elgar 11) A productive start to the Curran over, Malan pushing a couple through cover then pushing one to midwicket. Elgar is in on the act too, clipping the third ball in front of the square leg umpire for four. Lovely timing. I suspect we’ll be seeing Mark Wood very soon.“Morning Adam, morning everyone.” Good morning to you, Robert Ellson. “Have to say I have mixed feelings about Jerusalem. I was at the Galle Test last winter, where Billy the Trumpet played it from the top of the Fort, and the overall effect was both dodgily colonial and thrillingly magnificent. But I’m not sure he should go to his retirement without someone mentioning that he plays the wonderful solo at the end of this beautiful Divine Comedy song.” Yep, it’s contested space, that’s for sure. Every major political party has used it at one time or another. In fairness to the Barmy Army (I’m sometimes a little nasty about them on twitter) the did start the Jerusalem thing. Per the piece I posted, it was their idea back in 1998, which the ECB picked up in 2003. The marketing boss at the time had been to watch some professional wrestling and decided the England team needed some walk-on music. And there it was born for home Tests. 7th over: South Africa 13-0 (Malan 7, Elgar 6) Sure enough, Broad beats Elgar with his first delivery, around the wicket in at the left-hander, tailing away in the manner he did so magnificently and repeatedly to David Warner during the Ashes. But the opener keeps his cool, pushing one from the next delivery to give Malan the strike. Broad is up for leg before to the right-hander with a ball that slips past the edge and hits the back pad from wide of the crease but it hits him well outside the line and is missing the off-stump. Root was wise not to entertain a review.6th over: South Africa 11-0 (Malan 6, Elgar 5) Ooh, Curran finds Elgar’s inside edge when cutting and it was nearly all over for the opener - not far away from the woodwork. He’s off strike later in the over to backward point, which will now give Stuart Broad a chance at the left-hander for the first time in this innings.5th over: South Africa 10-0 (Malan 6, Elgar 4) That’s a lovely cover drive from Malan, getting well forward to Broad and stroking him through the line out to the boundary. Earlier in the over the England cordon were up for leg before when he missed a flick but it was going to miss leg stump. The series might be over for South Africa but there’s plenty of time here for Malan to leave a lasting mark.4th over: South Africa 6-0 (Malan 2, Elgar 4) Curran beats Elgar to begin with a delivery moving away both in the air and off the seam. He has another little victory later in the over when finding his leading edge, which spits out through the cordon for four. We talked a lot about Denly and Butter’s need of runs yesterday and the same applies to Elgar. His decline is getting problematic.“Morning Adam.” Hello, Michael Anderson. “On the topic of Philander’s pleasingly rounded stats, a score of 56 not out or 81 out in this innings would leave him with an overall test average of exactly 25. Unlikely perhaps but would be nice.”That’d be a thing of beauty - 5000 runs conceded averaging 25 when batting. I’m one of those aforementioned weirdos who likescravesneeds evenround numbers. And right angles, much to the enduring annoyance of my partner. 3rd over: South Africa 2-0 (Malan 2, Elgar 0) South Africa are off the mark via Malan, who tucks a couple off Broad through midwicket. It’s a less probing over than his first, the opener able to shoulder arms for the most part.I spent some time in the pub after the second day of this Test with Daniel Norcross and Andy Zaltzman trying to work out how many wickets Stuart Broad will finish with. We landed on 560. The assumptions: he’ll play every Test in England over the next two years but only every other in IndiaAustralia during the winter. And I can’t imagine why they would take him to Sri Lanka in March - let him rest.2nd over: South Africa 0-0 (Malan 0, Elgar 0) Slammin’ Sammy Curran has the new ball from the other end, as he has throughout the second half of this series. He’s generating some nice shape away from Elgar from the get-go, the opener defending when he has to and leaving the rest outside the off stump. Nice.An olddiscontinued email address of mine was featuring at the top of the page earlier today, which is fixed now. Hit refresh for it to automatically correct on your browster. If you want to get in touch at any stage, this is how you do it. 1st over: South Africa 0-0 (Malan 0, Elgar 0) Nice and full from Broad to begin, which is always encouraging. He beats Malan’s inside edge to finish, whacking into his back pad. There’s half an appeal but it is going well over the top. Nice start.There is a lot of love for Jerusalem as Billy the Trumpeter enjoys his final rendition before ‘retiring’ in his role. Four years ago, I spent too much time going back through the history of the poem, looking at how it became England’s cricket anthem. The piece featured in The Nightwatchman and is online these days.The players are on the field. Stuart Broad has the new ball, Pieter Malan the man facing up first. Three slips and a gully are his catchers, a short leg too. PLAY! What a gem from Andrew Samson. Of course, this is Vernon Philander’s final Test, which prompts plenty of discussion around stats. But they don’t get much better than this for those of us who always have their TV volume on multiples of five.An email from overnight to get us going. “All this mention of what we can and can’t hear on stump mic brings to mind some of the epic exchanges that we heard in the early days during World Series Cricket,” writes Scott Probst. “The best, and least repeatable were the conversations between those two poets Dennis Lillee and Garth Le Roux. Kept us up nights at boarding school, waiting for those two to go at it from either end of the pitch.”This always comes up in South Africa. I remember (fondly?) when Australia visited for the first time since readmission in 1994... you could hear everything. Shane Warne and Merv Hughes would have faced lengthy bans by today’s standards. “It’s not a minefield,” says Athers of the track on TV, “but there’s plenty there for the bowlers.” Indeed, there’s a healthy string of cracks at one end. Joe Root walks up and takes a look. “He’s the new Jim Laker,” Athers adds. The Sky coverage, both their callers on the SuperSport team and panels in London, has been excellent.Hello and welcome to the fourth day at the Bull Ring - the fourth and final day if the visitors have anything to do with it. They would never admit as much, but surely on days like today they arrive thinking about how wonderful life would be if they could wrap up the match half an hour before tea before settling into a lengthy session as the sun sets on the series and their successful Test tour.England have earned themselves a finish like that, just as their South African hosts are deserved the drubbing coming their way. It’s a simple game now, Joe Root’s men needing ten wickets to salute 3-1 with two full days to go. For Faf du Plessis’ charges, their target is 466 - colossal. So, the best they can do is resist and hope for rain. Indeed, they need to do what England did to them at this ground in 1995, but I can’t see any Mike Athertons floating around in this Proteas’ dressing room. We had a good old time on the OBO yesterday, let’s continue in that spirit throughout the morning do drop me a line or ping me a tweet. G’morning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d443dc2ba4e5ec4cff5174ead7db7b27e52495a/0_466_4421_2653/master/4421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=076c297600f1e67439bd31293585c7fb","title":"theatre access actors writers directors theatres accessibility","story":"Actors, writers and directors reflect on how far theatres have come in boosting accessibility for audiences and creativesMore stories are being told on stage by artists with disabilities. But the biggest problem is the architecture of theatres. Even if you have the talent to perform in some of these venues, just getting in the building is impossible. Actors and writers are told they can earn their stripes at the fringe level. How do you do that when accessible rehearsal rooms are the most expensive and every pub theatre is up a flight of stairs? I ended up opening my own rehearsal space, run by my production company, Aegis Productions.A huge step forward would be to establish quotas in West End ensembles. Ensembles, by definition, are meant to be everyone, so they should be inclusive. There is no reason why an ensemble for a musical can’t include a performer with a disability. These shows have the money and they should have the imagination. We need mainstream theatre organisations and producers to rise to the challenge of equal representation for disability.My show at the Finborough, Scrounger, was inspired by a case of discrimination I experienced when I was about to fly from London to Glasgow but ended up being removed from the flight, directly because of my disability. When the airline returned my wheelchair, it was damaged. The fallout from that incident made me very aware of the everyday injustices that are perpetrated by ordinary people. People who mean well often stand in the way of progress, because they are afraid of conflict. You see a lot of micro-aggressions and silencing, people saying things like: “Oh, it will be fine, don’t make a fuss.”And actually it won’t be fine, trying to get along and avoid conflict is how every political horror starts. This is a culture that prides itself on being progressive but also on avoiding conflict. I’m sorry, but you can’t have both. Progress and equality always mean confronting the status quo and that will always create conflict. I don’t like it, but I have to let go of the egotistical desire to be liked by everyone in order to not be complicit in the world’s injustice.Sophie Woolley: ‘Get the experts in’Venues need to employ deaf and disabled people – that is the best way to improve access. It’s about getting the experts in. Deaf people are really good at shouting and changing things because we have to be. We can’t be passive.I’m a writer and actor, and since 2013 I’ve self-described as a deaf cyborg. After I got my cochlear implant, I felt proud and decided to own my new identity.I didn’t train at drama college but started performing in nightclubs, pubs and galleries. I was going deaf when I made my early theatre work and I used interpreters in rehearsals, but I could not follow BSL-interpreted theatre. I preferred subtitles. I was conscious that I couldn’t enjoy the same cutting-edge productions that my peers could because of the lack of subtitled performances.At this time – around 15 years ago – there weren’t many shows that integrated subtitles into the stage design. I didn’t want anyone to feel the same sense of exclusion so I modelled best practice and made sure my work was creatively captioned.Even with my implant, I often need captions to properly engage with the performance. In big old theatre buildings such as the Old Vic, I can’t follow without captions in mid-size theatres such as the New Wolsey in Ipswich, I can follow everything. It all depends on the acoustic.In Augmented, my latest show, we have a really amazing lighting and projection designer, Joshua Pharo. He has the unique skillset of being able to do both lighting and video projection - that ensured our captioning was part of the show’s overall design. It’s exciting that more theatre-makers are playing with access as a theatrical form, like Midnight Movie did at the Royal Court. The Court now offers more than one captioned show per run, too. It just shows that we can change things. Access can be liberating and uplifting for everyone.Theatre is powerful and has a way of changing people’s perceptions. There is a social and civic responsibility here. As a director – and deputy artistic director of Birmingham Repertory theatre – I am passionate about representation, particularly those voices who have been marginalised historically.The Rep is part of a consortium of six venues (including Nottingham Playhouse, Stratford East, Sheffield Theatres, New Wolsey in Ipswich and Leeds Playhouse) which, with the company Graeae, have collaborated on the Ramps on the Moon programme. This is a commitment to having one mainstage show each year which is predominantly cast with deaf and disabled performers, as part of their season. That kind of commitment makes a real impact – off and on stage. If you were to remove a Ramps production, you would see the gap in work being presented at that scale. When Ramps finishes, what then? It needs to be a catalyst for all our theatres to make a genuine commitment to deaf and disabled artists, and audiences, in our big spaces.The next generation of deaf and disabled artists need to feel like there are opportunities for them to act, write, direct, design and produce just like their non-disabled counterparts. There’s much work to do. We can’t let them down.Jenny Sealey: ‘Everyone can make shows accessible’As the artistic director of Graeae I surround myself with tales from deaf and disabled artists who bring with them erse communication and access requirements. Together, we weave this into a theatrical narrative so it becomes an aesthetic artform.Graeae, along with other deaf and disabled-led companies, have been pushing the agenda for years. Since Reasons to be Cheerful (our Ian Dury-inspired musical by Paul Sirett) hit middle-scale stages, other directors have seen the richness of our aesthetic and the skill and talent within our community. This led to the Ramps on the Moon consortium. Things are moving on. Derby theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Globe and the National Theatre and are also casting more disabled actors and starting to work with disabled writers and directors.It comes down to attitude and a concern that employing deaf and disabled actors, writers and directors is going to cost more. It does cost more, but that is when Access to Work comes in. This government scheme supports the cost of audio describers, access workers, creative enablers (a term coined by Graeae where the conversation between enabler and artist is a creative collaborative process) and sign-language interpreters – although there is a cap on how much is paid out, which is very limiting. I work with interpreters almost constantly, so I have to have a “dry period” when my allowance has run out.To improve accessibility and representation throughout our industry, the answer is very simple – employ deaf and disabled people across the organisation (front of house, bar, marketing, senior management, board, etc) as well as on stage and backstage. Work with all creative teams to embed captioning, signing and audio description into the heart and design of all productions so that deaf and disabled audience members can enjoy any show they like rather than just on the “access night”. Graeae has been making every show accessible for more than 20 years and we are a small company. If we can do it, everyone can. Access is a human right – not a tag-on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23a5807d23ad1b44ef0a95750a9a75b97d48619c/0_0_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb477f1aeb4f479899bce46c9e5e40d1","title":"italy italian immersive language course learning holiday molise","story":"An immersive language course offers a glimpse of life and culture in little-known Molise and the skills to parlare away with the locals ‘Eccoci qua!” announces Fernando, pulling the minibus into the side of the road. Ahead of us, the hilltop town we have driven nearly three hours from Rome to reach shimmers in the late afternoon sun. Agnone is a picturesque settlement of some 5,000 inhabitants, all of whom – starting with Fernando, a local dairy farmer and occasional chauffeur – appear to have been sworn not to speak English to us.This isn’t hard, because the town is in Italy’s least-known province, Molise – a region so “undiscovered” that even the Italians have a standing joke, Il Molise non esiste. There are 10 of us – nine women and a man, from Australia, the US, the UK and France – and we are here for a total immersion language course called Live and Learn Italian.As its founder and director Jenifer Landor emphasises at our first evening together in an open-air pizzeria, it is not so much about the classes as the experience (lesson one: Italians think it’s weird to drink wine with pizza). Over the course of a week, this approach will take us up a mountain with artisanal baker Mercede and her devoted farm dog, and down into a 600-year-old wine cellar to sample Carlo’s wines, that are deemed so sensitive they are unable to travel beyond their home town (though he pours so generously that this is unlikely to be put to the test). We will make (and eat) ravioli in the kitchen of retired shoe-seller Maria, who has become a celebrated home cook, and meet up with the latest generation of the Di Nucci family, who forsook centuries of migratory shepherding – the transumanza – to set up a thriving cheese factory.We’re split into three groups on the basis of a written test and an interview with the three young teachers who will take charge of classroom tuition. It’s a little bit daunting but, as Landor says, it is to ensure nobody finds themselves bored or out of their depth. Complete beginners are discouraged from signing up, as they would miss out on the interaction with local people.“It’s up to you if you want to do the homework – you’re not schoolchildren,” she tells us. There’s a burst of ironic hilarity midway through the week when we discover the Italian for short cut (scorciatoia) but as my relatively advanced group quickly discovers, Italian is full of devilish prepositions and unlikely idioms, so it pays to do the legwork.Lessons take place each morning in an elegant former convent converted into a library and museum – its polished corridors flanked by rooms full of yellowing books. Only towards the end of the week do we discover a shuttered chamber containing a replica of the region’s most venerable artefact: La Tavola Osca. By now we are well-versed in the classical history of the area, having spent an afternoon being shown around an ancient amphitheatre carved into the hillside of a neighbouring settlement evocatively named Pietrabbondante.The original Osca (as it is affectionately called) is in the British Museum and is a small bronze tablet inscribed from right to left with the laws of the Samnite people, who ruled this part of Italy from the sixth century BC until the Roman empire took over. Their five tribes traded with Greece and worshipped Ulysses – and remains of their civilisation are still being dug out of the Molise hillsides. It is astonishing to sit on stone amphitheatre benches that Samnite stonemasons, chiselling away two centuries before Christ, smoothed into curves designed to mirror and support the human back – Italy’s first ergonomic seating, we are told.There is another copy of the Osca in the B\u0026ampB where four of us are staying – the family home of artist Tonina. Though she lives in a flat nearby, the four-storey house is full of her craftwork and her memories. She greets us each morning at a table groaning with breakfast delicacies – mounds of ricotta drizzled with a local liqueur, plates piled with cakes and bread, waiting to be slathered in homemade apricot and cherry jams. With the food comes the first of the day’s Italian conversation, for which we are sometimes joined by Tonina’s maths teacher sister: this isn’t a course for people with a limited appetite for carbs and chat any more than it’s for those who find walking a drag, though at least some of the breakfast calories are burned off by frequent yomps up and down Agnone’s cobbled streets.Nor is it a course for those with an aversion to being summoned by bells: Agnone is a town of 14 churches, most of them equipped with the massive clangers that are its claim to a niche sort of fame. The Marinelli bell foundry in the centre of town is said to be Italy’s oldest family business. Since the 14th century, the Marinellis have been sending their campane to churches and monasteries throughout the Catholic world, from Africa to South America. A video in its museum shows a succession of popes blessing the soon-to-be bells as sluice gates are opened to let moulten bronze surge infernally along channels in the foundry floor. It still makes 30 or more bells to order each year, and when we visit workers are about to crack open the latest huge clay cast. It’s a make-or-break moment that will reveal whether the painstakingly decorated bell will ring true or have to be fed back into the smelting vats.In the past, the town rang to the sound of gold-, iron- and coppersmiths, though almost all of the workshops are closed now – testament to the depopulation that recently led to Molise offering €700 a month for three years to anyone willing to live and set up a business in one of its smaller towns.There’s nothing much for young people to do here, sighs Tonina, though they all pile back for their summer holidays and the town’s historic winter warmer – the Ndocciata fire festival on Christmas Eve, which involves columns of men wearing necklaces of flaming sticks.Most people sign up to the course for two weeks, but by the end of just one I’m surprised to find myself chatting away a raffica, unabashed by my all-too-frequent errori – not least when I loudly mistake a fertility symbol carved into the amphitheatre for a bird that has lost a wing. (Without missing a beat, our guide finds a simpler synonym for phallus.)By the time we have rattled back to Rome in the minibus, several of us have come to an agreement: we’ll be back, but first we have to work off all those breakfasts.

She was earning $4.35 an hour carrying heavy trays and walking several miles a day – pumping breastmilk in the restaurant toilet when she could, and living in fear of her C-section scar reopening.“The biggest thing was that I was kind of scared. When you have major surgery like that and then you’re pushing your body so harshly,” said the mother of three from Bondurant, Iowa, who is remarkably phlegmatic about the experience.When she got home, Rebeschini would take over childcare duties from her husband Ron, 33, an optician, so he could go to work.“I remember every time I had to work I was like ‘please don’t reopen,’” she says of the scar on her abdomen. “I mean I was essentially risking my life.”Rebeschini’s experience is far from rare for America’s mothers. One in four women in the US return to work within two weeks of childbirth, according to the advocacy group Paid Leave US (PL+US).The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends women take at least six weeks off work following childbirth. But with no federally mandated paid family leave, for many women maternity leave is an unaffordable luxury.“If you look at paid leave rates between white families and families of colour, it’s even worse,” said Myra Jones-Taylor, chief policy officer at child development non-profit Zero to Three. “Parents just can’t afford to stay home with their babies.”Rebeschini, who left her previous job around a month before the birth, said financially she had no option but to work.Working shifts of up to 12 hours, she found the separation from her newborn agonising.“I would come home and the first thing I did was make sure that he was breathing … When you’re not physically there you just have to trust that he’s fine. You worry about the bond of being gone for so long … is he going to recognise you?” she said.She said she didn’t dare tell her new employer how recently she had given birth for fear of being considered a liability. While her manager was supportive of her pumping breastmilk, there was nowhere suitable to do it. “So I had to take my breast pump into the bathroom and hope that no one came in and saw me pumping.”Karter is now four years old, but Rebeschini worries about the potential impact of her early absence.Today she still experiences pain in her abdomen which she attributes to returning to work so soon.Rebeschini has since had a third child, Brody, who is now one. This time, she took two months off, but with no maternity pay it resulted in the couple falling behind on bills and having to declare bankruptcy – delaying their plan to buy a home.“You can prepare all you want to be off for a certain time and not have pay but it just doesn’t work. If we had paid leave, we wouldn’t have fallen so far behind that we couldn’t get ourselves out of a hole. We wouldn’t have that stain on our credit.”Dr Rebecca Jackson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco, said breastfeeding is one of the biggest challenges for women who return to work early – especially low-wage workers.“If you’re driving a bus, how do you stop that bus to pump milk?”After a C-section, she recommends women take eight weeks off and to avoid heavy activity to prevent complications. “A lot of women still have significant pain at two weeks after,” she said.Kirstin Moody, 36, a waitress from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, could only afford to take one week off after giving birth to her son Alex, now 13, by emergency C-section. The waitress ended up ripping her incision six times and as a result can no longer feel her lower stomach.“I would feel like I was on fire, like somebody would take a hot poker and just drag it across the bottom of my stomach,” Moody said. “I was on pain medication for some of the time but it generally doesn’t help because you don’t get to fully rest your body.”As a single mother, Moody depended on the help of family for childcare while she worked nights. Parting with her newborn son was intolerable.“Oh God it was horrible. I cried and cried and I would sit at work and I would cry.”Paid family leave has gained broad support and looks set to become a policy point in the 2020 presidential election, though there are still disagreements in Washington on how to pay for it.In December the White House held a summit dedicated to the subject and recently passed a law to give 2.1 million federal workers 12 weeks of paid parental leave. So far, eight states and the District of Columbia have passed their own family leave bills.But despite all the momentum, millions of women are still having to return to work after childbirth long before they are ready.“On the politician front at least there’s progress,” said Jones-Taylor. “But any time we have a mother who is going back to work bleeding that’s not good for mum, it’s not good for babies, and it’s really just not good for the workforce.”According to National Partnership for Women \u0026amp Families, the benefits of paid family leave in states that have introduced it include improved worker morale, time for parents to bond with their children, increased breastfeeding, more children getting vaccinations on time, cuts in children’s hospital admissions and reduced probabilities of having ADHD and hearing problems.Although some private companies are starting to catch up by offering paid family leave as a benefit, many women get around the inflexibility of the corporate world by starting their own businesses. But with no paid maternity leave, there is still pressure to go back to work.Jessica Mann, 35, owner of Chicago-based beauty company Ari Rose Body Care, was back at work five days after giving birth to her one-year-old daughter Lila.Her partner Bryant Ousley, 33, was working long hours in a new job and did not qualify for any parental leave, so Mann was also doing the majority of the care for their three children.“Being a small business owner I felt that there was no other way that things were going to continue going without me and so it was more of a necessity than anything,” she said. “And then of course it impacts your income. So we have a new baby and we have three kids, to not work and not have that income would also impact our household.”Virginia delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy was back on the campaign trail knocking doors two weeks after giving birth by C-section to her now two-year-old twin sons Alex and Xander, who were born premature and spent four months in neonatal intensive care.“I had tremendous back pain, shoulder pain, and you have to think that you’re just coming out of major surgery where you are literally being sliced open and giving life to human beings, it takes a lot out of your body. But I was in a position where there was no time to rest, I didn’t have an option to relax.”Caroll Foy, 38, who was then still working as a public defender, was on disability benefits – which in some states can be used for pregnancy – so she was entitled to a portion of her income. But with she and her husband Jeffrey Foy, 38, a supervisor at a non-profit, taking cuts to their paycheque, their finances came under strain.It was such a wake-up call that she has introduced a paid family leave bill in Virginia. “When you’re bringing a new child into this world and you’re expanding your family, your income shrinks … I want to make sure that other women and families don’t have to make the same painful decisions about being with their newborn baby or paying for their bills and keeping a roof over their head.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ced557dc1584e566ada471a958ea0053269c021/118_270_2332_1399/master/2332.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87330358fb6ceda3a43450ecd34dd747","title":"pennsylvania residents mariner east pipelines drinking water contamination","story":"A community in Pennsylvania says clay-colored water appeared during a drilling mud spill, but the pipeline company insists it’s not to blameEvery evening Erica and Jon Tarr load up their car with towels, toiletries, and dirty dishes, before driving their two-year-old daughter to a relative’s home to bathe, wash-up and eat a meal cooked in clean water.The Tarrs, who moved into their spacious detached home in semi-rural Pennsylvania last April, have relied upon bottled water and family generosity since June 2019 when their crystalline tap water first turned murky.Since then, they’ve spent more than $32,000 dollars on new equipment, lab tests, bottled water, repairing pipes and parts damaged by the turbid water. It still isn’t safe, and they don’t know why.“It’s sad and frustrating, I can’t bathe my daughter, wash my hands or do a load of laundry, it’s like living in constant crisis. We’re not the only ones in this situation, but we feel so alone,” said Erica Tarr, 31, a paediatric nurse.The clay-colored water appeared around the time of a drilling mud spill at a nearby construction site for the Mariner East 2 (ME2) pipelines – a beleaguered multi billion dollar project transporting volatile natural gas liquids from shale fields of eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania to an export facility in Delaware county, ready to ship to Europe to manufacture plastics.The ME2 horizontal directional drilling (HDD) project – which is subject to multiple criminal and regulatory investigations – has contaminated surface and groundwater sources in hundreds of mud spills, and created sinkholes in parks, roads and back yards since construction began in early 2017. HDD drilling is particularly susceptible to spills known as inadvertent returns, in which lubricating mud erupts through weak spots in the rock.But as the Tarrs’ tap water became increasingly turbid and the pressure plummeted, the pipeline company Sunoco Logistics, a subsidiary of Texas-based Energy Transfer LP, insisted the project was not to blame.The Tarr family, like 13 million or more American households, relies on a private well for drinking water which they – not regulators – are responsible for monitoring and keeping safe. So, in October they installed a sophisticated filter system and drilled a new well in their picturesque wooded backyard, a couple of hundred meters from the worksite.The water seemed fine for a few days, but then started smelling strongly of nail polish and burned Erica’s mouth when she tried brushing her teeth.Lab results detected toluene and MTBE – volatile organic compounds found in fuel.According to local records, an old Sunoco fuel pipeline leaked tens of thousands of gallons of hazardous liquids close to the Tarr’s new well back in 1992. It’s unclear whether the underground legacy contaminants were disturbed by the current construction work. (A geologist hired by the company found that ME2 construction activities did not impact the Tarrs well.)Then, in early January the tap water turned murky once again, John and daughter Evie got sick, and dark grainy sediment coated the cistern.“It’s a nightmare … living without water for so long is a nightmare,” said Tarr. “ It’s like we’ve been thrown to the wolves, left to figure it out … we can’t keep living like this.”The Mariner East 2 pipeline project stretches 350 miles through 17, mostly densely populated counties. It runs alongside the 1930s Mariner East 1 gasoline pipeline, recently repurposed to transport butane, propane and ethane – which are odorless and highly flammable.The US fossil fuel industry has surged over the past decade as a result of unconventional techniques that combine horizontal drilling and fracking to extract oil and gas from shale and other underground rock formations.ME pipelines have the capacity to transport enough ethane to manufacture just under a billion single plastic bottles every day, according to analysis by Food and Water Watch, a not-for-profit accountability watchdog.The project has been mired in controversies from the start:In early 2018 the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) shut down the project for a month and fined Sunoco $12.6m for what it called “egregious” violations of environmental laws during its first year of construction. Shortly after, the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) ordered a temporary shut down after sinkholes opened up at a construction site in West Whiteland Township, Chester county.In January 2020, the DEP issued a $2m fine for another series of drilling fluid spills in 2017 which contaminated Raystown Lake in Huntingdon county. Some were not reported for over 500 days.“There have been questions about the quality of the permits since they were granted in 2014 … there is a pattern of malfeasance that is established and known which was overlooked when permits were granted by the DPE and Wolf administration,” said Sam Rubin, from Food and Water Watch.A spokesman for Democratic governor Tom Wolf said he believes in strong environmental protection and responsibility for permit holders. “The significant fines, penalties, oversight and accountability by the DEP under his administration are evidence of exactly that.”Still, the project is also subject to ongoing criminal and civil investigations which include:“Only in Pennsylvania can an operator create a documentable track record over decades of serial destruction and contamination and continue to be permitted by state agencies and aided by legislators in further rolling back environmental protections,” said state congresswoman Danielle Friel from Chester county, who was elected in 2018 on an anti-pipeline ticket.Chester county commissioners have slammed the company for “appalling” lack of pipeline information, accusing the company of withholding safety information, putting profit over safety, and creating mistrust among residents – allegations Energy Transfer denies.Friel added: “Pennsylvania has a corruption problem. Through a massive lobbying, campaign finance and public relations effort, the fossil fuel industry has successfully manipulated our legislature, our local governments and regulatory agencies.”Lisa Coleman from Energy Transfer said: “We are committed to adhering to the rules and regulations specified in the approved permits as we complete the construction and restoration phases of our projects ... We believe our project was properly permitted by all agencies.”Despite mounting public opposition and fears about the company’s safety record, emergency plans and alleged criminal wrongdoing, Wolf refuses to halt the project.This intractable position has left communities dealing with contaminated water and environmental hazards feeling desperate.Rosemary Fuller – one of the Safety Seven – lives a couple of miles from the Tarrs in a large gated property where the family moved in 2003, smitten by the “idyllic peaceful” location. They signed a permanent easement – or right of way – over to the company in 2015 after being assured the project was safe and unobtrusive, according to Fuller, 60. The pipelines run along the main road which runs through the well-to-do semi-rural neighborhood.Almost five years later, noisy construction sites are dotted throughout the community, there are six sinkholes within a mile or so of Fuller’s house, and in November a valve site situated within this densely populated residential township leaked gasoline. Residents called emergency services after smelling the strange odour.Dangerous bacteria including E coli were detected in the Fuller’s well water last July, since then the family has relied on bottled water delivered by Sunoco.Last week, a film of petrol blue coloured grease was visible in the cistern and sink where Fuller brushes her teeth.The project has had a huge impact on the whole family: Fuller’s husband has incurable cancer which means his immune system is compromised, and therefore spends most of the week away from home to avoid getting sick from the water. Meanwhile Fuller spends her time analysing lab reports, risk assessments, and company documents which are spread across the kitchen counters and dining table.“It’s a nightmare, I’m dealing with this all day every day, when I should be with my husband. I have nightmares that my daughter drives into a sinkhole,” said Fuller tearfully. “I feel so unsure about the present and the future that I just want rid of my home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97a7d8bdc43b483daf7b6b2a14a5a04dfac19a9d/0_372_5578_3347/master/5578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09c8399194a3806bf1cdea9506b8a66e","title":"pete buttigieg mckinsey donations","story":"Forty employees have contributed to the former mayor’s campaign as experts say his ties have ‘cast a shadow of questions’Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg is taking pains to distance himself from McKinsey, the elite consulting firm where the former South Bend mayor worked after graduate school.But Buttigieg’s ties to McKinsey run still deep throughout his campaign, including through the ranks of deep-pocketed donors who help fund it. Forty McKinsey employees have donated to Buttigieg’s campaign, including those involved in the firm’s corporate restructuring, banking and biotech, private equity, pharmaceutical, defense industry and oil and gas isions.Those donors include top-tier employees for the firm. Gary Pinkus, the chairman of McKinsey in North America, donated $2,800. Adam Barth, from McKinsey’s Houston office who consults utilities for the company, donated $2,800. Rajesh Parekh, a senior partner who heads McKinsey’s pharmaceuticals and medical products practice, donated $2,000. Kurt Chauviere, a partner who specializes in banking and corporate restructuring for McKinsey, gave $1,000.McKinsey employees have also headlined or been slated to headline fundraising events for Buttigieg. And according to multiple analyses of Federal Election Commission filings, Buttigieg has received more donations from McKinsey employees than any other Democratic candidate in the 2020 presidential field.The ongoing support suggests that, at the least, Buttigieg will continue to face tough criticism about McKinsey throughout his time on the campaign trail, even as he pivots away from the company.The Buttigieg campaign has focused less on his time at McKinsey and more on what strategists call “kitchen table issues” – economic issues that affect everyday Americans. Buttigieg himself has penned op-eds and laced that subject area into his speeches. His campaign has also been running ads on digital platforms hyping his campaign’s economic platform.On Friday the campaign released an ad featuring the Iowa state senator Bill Dotzler describing how Buttigieg is “committed to raising the economic security of Iowans”. That ad is the latest in a series of TV and digital ads airing in Iowa and New Hampshire, focused on economic issues. The ads don’t cite his time at McKinsey.Buttigieg has removed the word “businessman” from his Twitter bio, said in a recent debate that his time as an associate at the consulting firm was not the “biggest part” of his career and called “bullshit” when a New York Times editorial board member suggested that Buttigieg was directly involved in a bread pricing scandal related to McKinsey.In the past Buttigieg more closely tied himself to the firm. When he ran unsuccessfully for state treasurer in Indiana he leaned heavily on his three years at McKinsey. But as some of the firm’s controversial dealings have come to light, he has taken extra steps to demystify anything he did at the company and also voice disagreement with some of the firm’s practices in recent years.Buttigieg has been dogged by pressing questions and criticism of his Buttigieg’s tenure there. Buttigieg, from the start of his presidential campaign, has emphasized that he worked more on grocery pricing and later revealed that other clients included Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Resources Defense Council, among others.Buttigieg has denied involvement in any of the controversial work the company did but that hasn’t stopped McKinsey from serving as a flashpoint for his critics or defenders.It’s unclear how the barrage of attacks will play in the Iowa and New Hampshire contests, which Buttigieg campaign officials recently told donors is key to his long-term prospects in the presidential race. Ian Bremmer, a political scientist and founder of the political risk and consulting firm Eurasia Group, said that Buttigieg’s McKinsey work is unlikely to prove to be a liability in Iowa.“It’s a New York thing. It’s a DC thing,” Bremmer said, adding most of the criticism about Buttigieg’s time at McKinsey has been “ludicrous” and “beyond stupid”. “He was a junior consultant. He was working 80 hours a week doing scuttwork on whatever client they tell him to work on. There is literally zero autonomy for these people.”Bremmer said that the criticism of Buttigieg really just “shows perniciousness in an attempt to smear the guy”.Some of the toughest news cycles for Buttigieg during the campaign have involved his fundraising practices, providing ammunition for opponents who say the candidate is too closely linked to corporate largesse.About a month after revelations about a fundraiser in a wine cave in California, the Buttigieg campaign has increased security to prevent leaks at fundraisers. Donors were asked to check their phones at a fundraising cattle call in Chicago over the weekend where high-ranking Buttigieg campaign officials, including his campaign manager, Mike Schmuhl senior strategist Michael Halle the national constituency director, Hasoni Pratts and the national policy director, Sonal Shah laid out the state of the campaign and their path through Iowa and New Hampshire.Buttigieg’s time at McKinsey was not a major topic of discussion, according to multiple Democratic with knowledge of the meeting.“I don’t think it’s a big deal for voters,” one Buttigieg donor said of McKinsey. “It’s a salient issue only for the elites, for the chattering class. But most voters don’t know what McKinsey is, let alone care that he worked for a supermarket chain and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.”But Murshed Zaheed, a veteran progressive strategist, said Buttigieg’s McKinsey ties won’t go away and are an ongoing liability.“I think what McKinsey has done is it has cast a dark pall over his campaign on a number of fronts because I think it has cast a shadow of questions when it comes to transparency and ethics,” Zaheed said. “His whole time at McKinsey really raises questions about his cosiness to Wall Street”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14464adf502fd32eb3c37b345aa86c52b852b023/131_414_3687_2212/master/3687.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdea0da7287475a7614463928b6090f8","title":"football whistleblower rui pinto behind isabel dos santos leaks luanda leaks","story":"Football Leaks founder passed on financial records of Africa’s richest woman, says lawyerA Portuguese man behind one of the biggest exposés in the history of football has been identified as the source of a leaked cache of financial records about the business empire of Africa’s richest woman, Isabel dos Santos.Lawyers for Rui Pinto, who is awaiting trial in Portugal on charges including alleged hacking and attempted extortion, said in 2018 he passed a non-profit whistleblowing organisation a hard drive containing data relating to Dos Santos’s business empire, which is estimated at $2.2bn.Pinto is the founder of Football Leaks, which revealed confidential information about some of the world’s leading teams, which resulted in inquiries by tax authorities into several top players.He was not previously known to be the source of the Luanda Leaks, a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts detailing the business operations of Dos Santos, whose father ruled Angola for 38 years before stepping down as president in September 2017.The Luanda Leaks project is based on a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts detailing the business operations of Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the former president of Angola.The files were initially obtained by the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).The documents, which cover a period between 1980 and 2018, have been reviewed by more than 120 journalists from 37 media outlets, including the , the BBC and the Portuguese newspaper\u0026nbspExpresso., the BBC and the New York Times were among 37 media outlets that earlier this month reported on the contents of the leaked documents, revealing the complex financial schemes that helped Dos Santos amass vast a fortune at the expense of the Angolan state. Dos Santos denies she became a billionaire through nepotism or corruption.The files were initially obtained by the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).On Monday, PPLAAF identified the founder of Football Leaks as its source, saying in a statement: “The source of the Luanda Leaks is the whistleblower Rui Pinto.”“PPLAAF is pleased that once again a whistleblower is revealing to the world actions that go against international public interest,” said William Bourdon, the president of PPLAAF and also a lawyer for Pinto.Bourdon, a French human rights lawyer who has also acted for Edward Snowden, added: “Like in the case of the Football Leaks, these revelations should allow for new investigations to be launched and thus help in the fight against impunity for financial crimes in Angola and in the world.”The ICIJ’s director, Gerard Ryle, said: “The leaking of this material to PPLAAF, and in turn to ICIJ’s media partners, provided indisputable evidence of unnecessary misery that was inflicted on the ordinary people of Angola, and the role of enablers who got rich by helping. The documents came from a concerned citizen – someone doing the right thing by the public.”Since the publication last week of the Luanda Leaks, Dos Santos has been named as a criminal suspect in Angola, where prosecutors are investigating alleged embezzlement and mismanagement of funds during her leadership of the state oil giant Sonangol.Dos Santos denies accusations of nepotism and corruption. She has previously denounced Angolan criminal inquiries and media reports about her financial affairs as part of a politically motivated “witch-hunt” by the new Angolan president.“The allegations … are extremely misleading and untrue,” she said in her most recent statement. “This is a very concentrated, orchestrated and well-coordinated political attack, ahead of elections in Angola next year.”In its statement identifying Pinto as the source of the Luanda Leaks, PPLAAF said “the disclosure of the documents to PPLAAF was not politically motivated”.The Football Leaks website, launched in 2015, said its mission was to “show the hidden side of football”. The information it obtained and eventually shared with journalists around Europe raised concerns about the financial practices of some of the world’s biggest football clubs.Pinto, who was operating from Budapest, was detained in Hungary in January 2019 and extradited to Portugal in March. Earlier this month, a Portuguese judge ruled he would stand trial.Pinto faces 25 years in prison if found guilty of all 90 charges against him, his lawyer said. The charges include attempted extortion and hacking into the secret information at a number of organisations. He denies all wrongdoing and has never accepted the charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52d91760da2bd453ffc3473d039bd8b3171e4995/984_789_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=699f38eec0f8701597df4f68b9a2c92a","title":"kim jong uns aunt reappears six years after purge rumours","story":"Appearance of Kim Kyong-hui next to the North Korean leader at a performance puts paid to talk of execution Kim Jong-un’s aunt has appeared in public for the first time in more than six years, ending speculation that she had been purged or executed after helping her nephew establish himself as North Korea’s leader.The official newspaper of North Korea’s ruling party, the Rodong Sinmun, showed Kim Kyong-hui seated next to Kim and his wife, Ri Sol-ju, at a performance to mark the lunar new year at a theatre in Pyongyang on Saturday.Her name was also mentioned in a report on the event by the KCNA state news agency.Rumours that Kim Kyong-hui had been sidelined, or possibly executed, gained traction after her influential husband, Jang Song-thaek, was executed by firing squad for treason and corruption in December 2013.Days after Jang’s death, state media named his wife as a member of the funeral committee for another senior official. But she was not present at a ceremony to mark the second anniversary, days later, of the death of her brother and Kim Jong-un’s father, Kim Jong-il, and her name had not been mentioned in KCNA dispatches until Sunday.Some observers believed she had become a victim of a series of purges her nephew ordered in an attempt to rid the ruling party of potential rivals. Others speculated that Kim Kyong-hui, a heavy drinker, had died due to ill health.The 73-year-old’s sudden appearance is being seen as a show of family unity as the regime seeks to pressure the US into making concessions to restart stalled denuclearisation talks.While she is unlikely to regain formal positions of political influence, her presence is hugely symbolic, according to Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Stimson Center in Washington.“The sudden appearance of major officials in a regime like North Korea’s is always massively important,” Madden told Agence France-Presse. “Even if she does not have a political office or formal position in the regime, making a personal appearance like this is a public demonstration of support for her nephew,” he added. “It is a strong expression of Kim family unity.”Before her absence from public life, Kim Kyong-hui – the youngest daughter of North Korea’s founder, Kim Il-sung – was a four-star army general and politburo member.She is said to have been instrumental in grooming her nephew to succeed his father, who died from a heart attack in late 2011."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Scheme to replace wards of court system delayed again due to lack of fundingTaoiseach says UK politicians were \u0026lsquovery badly exposed\u0026rsquo when it came to Irish affairsMet \u0026Eacuteireann issues yellow snow and ice warning for seven countiesFindings emerged from data gathered as part of project involving DCU and GAADCU research shows children\u0026rsquos skills in running and jumping plateau at the age of 10On the canvass: \u0026lsquoAs long as we have someone from Longford in the D\u0026aacuteil one person\u0026rsquoGrowing nervousness in Fine Gael as party trails Fianna F\u0026aacuteil in opinion pollsHe would remind you from time to time that it was as a defender he played for ArmaghShock and heartbreak in west Dublin at tragic deaths of three McGinley childrenBooks of condolence opened in Belfast, Derry following death of \u0026lsquohero of peace process\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute awaiting results of toxicology tests on bodies discovered in house last FridayMark Molloy, father of baby who died in Portlaoise hospital, steps down after six monthsGarda\u0026iacute are treating the incident as suspiciousTerence MacSwiney died on hunger strike for Irish freedom in 1920 in Brixton prisonAward-winning author donates books to D\u0026uacuten Laoghaire libraryWoman in her 30s arrested following incident at house in Gorey on Sunday morningTaking the Liberties: Extinction Rebellion Ireland campaigners knock on doors in inner cityPresident to attend 75th anniversary of liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi camp"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4152671.1580117072!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar blames british ignorance of ireland for brexit impasse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar meets  European Commission Chief Negotiator on Brexit Michel Barnier at Government Buildings in Dublin on Monday. Photograph: Tom Honan.British ignorance about Ireland was “very badly exposed” during the Brexit negotiations, according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Mr Varadkar told the BBC’s political editor Laura Kuenssberg that Irish people understand a lot about Britain, but the opposite is not the case. He criticised the political classes in Britain for their ignorance of Ireland though Britain has a “very colonial history”. He suggested that the British had underestimated the extent to which France and Germany would stand by Ireland in the Brexit negotiations. “There were people in Britain who thought France, Germany and Britain would get together at a big summit and tell the smaller countries what’s what. That is not how the 21st century works. It is certainly not how the European Union works.” Mr Varadkar also revealed details of the secret summit he had in October outside Liverpool with British prime minister Boris Johnson. It broke the deadlock in relation to Brexit. RapportThere the pair agreed a deal which would mean no hard border in Ireland and instead the border would be down the Irish Sea. Mr Varadkar described the rapport between the two men. “I think it is a simple story really. It was two guys in a room in Wirral talking on our own for more than an hour,” he said. “We got down to business and we talked turkey. Sometimes when you do these things without officials present, it is easier. It was one of those strange conversations where the prime minister said, ‘my staff will kill me for saying this, but if I said this, what would you say back? If I move on this, would you move on that?’“We found out very quickly that we had shared objectives and that we could work together. That was a crucial moment in Wirral. Eventhough it was not all sorted that day, I knew leaving Liverpool Airport that things were looking promising again.” The Taoiseach stated that that the EU will have the stronger hand in the forthcoming trade negotiations and that a trade deal cannot be agreed in a piecemeal fashion. “We have a population and a market of 450 million people, the UK it’s about 60, so if these were two teams up against each other playing football, who do you think has the stronger team?” he asked. “The final deal and the new relationship will have to be comprehensive. That is always the way with these types of relationships. When I hear people talking about piecemeal, it sound a bit like have cake and eat it. You can have a trade deal for the areas where you have an advantage and none where you haven’t. That’s not fair and it’s not something that will fly in Europe. ” He suggested that Mr Johnson’s view that a trade deal can be done by the end of December is too optimistic and that there may be an extension beyond that to get a deal done. Britain is due to the leave the European Union at 11pm on Friday night.

Afghan militias are believed to be involved in the battle on the Syrian government side. Smuggling himself across the border, he travelled to a suburb south of Tehran and signed up at a mosque. Most of the Fatemiyoun\u0027s volunteers were from Iran\u0027s large community of Afghan migrant workers and refugees, researchers and officials said.A far smaller number are recruited directly from Afghanistan, sometimes encouraged by pro-Iran clerics.Economic hardship has been recruits\u0027 main motivation, according to a recent report by the United States Institute of Peace which interviewed fighters and their families, while some also sought adventure, or were driven by religious sentiment.Mehdi\u0027s wages began as soon as he joined up, he recalls, but so did indoctrination as instructors tried to whip up the recruits\u0027 religious feeling. Veterans say instructors stressed that Shia holy shrines were in danger from Syrian rebels and the Fatemiyoun had a duty to defend them.Pro-government fighters in Al-Bab, Aleppo province, in November 2016“From that day I was receiving my salary. And they started to work on our mind,” he said. “Both Afghans and Iranians were training us. Afghans were telling us something about war and working with weapons, but Iranians were working on our minds. We had so many religious programs that we were thirsty for martyrdom. We were counting down to go to Syria and die,“ he said.“They were telling us that our beliefs are the only thing we have and we should defend them.”Training was often cursory. If commanders were short of troops at the front, recruits sometimes only had 10 days of training, recalled another veteran who gave his name as Ali Reza.If the situation was better, it could be twice as long.“Some were asking why Iran\u0027s military does not intervene directly, and Iranians were saying that they don’t intervene directly through their military because US forces are there and could create more pressure between the two countries,” Ali Reza said.The Afghan militias were thrown into the battle for Aleppo alongside regular Syrian forces, seen here during fighting in the city in 2016Both men were pitched into the battle for Aleppo. The Fatemiyoun were directed by Iranian commanders and employed to breach defences, or clear the way ahead of Syrian forces.Casualty rates were often appalling. “In one of my most intense fights, our group had nearly 50 members but when we reached the rear base, only three or four were unhurt,“ he said. ”Two of my friends were killed there, one had a fiancé. I saw the deaths of my many friends by my own eyes in Syrian front lines.”Mehdi said he had served three tours of six months each, before deciding he had enough. “First, I got enough money and now I don’t need as much,” he said.He also felt the shrines he had vowed to defend were no longer in danger. Many of the Afghans who fought at the peak of the war have demobilised, staying in Iran to take advantage of their new legal status, or returning across the border to family.Those returning to Afghanistan are often viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who doubt their loyalties.Shia religious and political leaders in Afghanistan have almost all opposed sending Afghans to join the Fatemiyoun.Yet if the call to defend the holy shrines again, Mehdi said he would return. “If I feel they are again close to destroying shrines, I will not hesitate and will go back.”Brexit latest news: Leo Varadkar compares trade talks to football and claims he\u0026#39s on the \u0026#39stronger team\u0026#39Passenger plane crashes in Afghanistan, officials sayKobe Bryant, NBA legend, killed along with daughter in California helicopter crashGroundhog Day: how the Punxsutawney Phil prediction at Gobbler\u0026#39s Knob forecasts the weatherFormer national security advisers say Huawei risks can be managed, as US ramps up pressureSuspected coronavirus carriers coming to the UK may not have been tested by mistakeCoronavirus: Foreign Office preparing to extract British nationals from WuhanCoronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China How will the Brexit transition period work?Brexit day: what happens after January 31?Trump did want to withhold Ukraine aid, John Bolton says, prompting calls for him to testify in impeachment trialSurge in prisoners serving life sentences makes overcrowding \u0026#39impossible\u0026#39 to end, says Cambridge studyThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayChinese premier Li Keqiang in Wuhan to lead emergency efforts as coronavirus deaths in China rise to 80  Monday morning news briefing: Kobe Bryant killed in air crashCouncils put climate emergency ahead of tackling deadly pollution, says studyComment: The baguette is on the brink, but the mushroom shows the way to a culinary comebackComment: As the Holocaust fades from living memory, it is more urgent than ever to teach its lessonsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/27/TELEMMGLPICT000222767093_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"foreign office preparing extract british nationals wuhan amid","story":"Wuhan has been placed on lockdown by Chinese authorities in a bid to contain the virusDepartment for Health \u0026amp Social CareThe Foreign Office is drafting plans to extract British nationals stranded by the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. The Government confirmed that it is working on making an option available for Britons to leave Hubei province which has effectively been shut down by Chinese authorities in a bid to contain the virus.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: We continue to monitor developments closely and are in close touch with the Chinese authorities. The safety and security of British nationals is always our primary concern.The Foreign Office recently updated its guidance to advise against all travel to Hubei province, which has been on lockdown for several days.But the guidance also added: If you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so. This is due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak.A medic guides patients to a hospital in Wuhan in central China\u0026#39s Hubei provinceOther countries including France, the United States and Japan have already mobilised plans to remove its citizens from Wuhan.The announcement came after Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, suggested UK citizens could be airlifted from China. Asked if he supported flying Britons back from Wuhan and elsewhere, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: I think I would be very sympathetic and I\u0027m sure the Foreign Office would be too.Almost 3,000 people have fallen ill and more than 80 people have died as a result of coronavirusMr Hunt said the NHS is well-equipped to deal with patients returning with the virus but warned that it could strain the service.This is a very difficult time of year for the NHS - it is the most difficult time. But, again, my experience is that the NHS does know how to cope with these kinds of emergencies.I think the thing that will be difficult is the knock-on impact on other NHS services, he said.I think it would be very, very challenging for the NHS in terms of the regular workload but I have absolutely no doubt that, when it comes to doing what comes to necessary to isolate the virus and keep the public safe, our doctors and nurses will do exactly what they need to do.Coronavirus everything you need to know puffEarlier on Monday, the medical director of Public Health England, Yvonne Doyle, said she would be surprised if coronavirus cases were not soon confirmed in Britain. As of yesterday, some 52 people across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have been tested for the deadly flu-like virus but all have returned negative.Professor Doyle told the Today programme: The important thing here is to be aware of the case definition of what constitutes a risk to the person and to the population. So if somebody is unwell..if they have a cough, if they have fever, difficulty breathing and of course if they have been connected to Wuhan those are the four criteria.Otherwise we have a lot of people who are just very worried but well.England\u0027s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty also said there was a fair chance cases would emerge in Britain as the overall number reported around the world climbed to about 2,744 including 80 deaths, which have all occurred in China.The current risk to the public remains low, the health department said, adding that the Government is continuing to monitor the situation closely.Members of a military medical team head to a hospital in Wuhan The announcement will come as a welcome relief to Britons inside Wuhan who have told of struggles to make contact with UK authorities.A pair of British teachers who have been working in Wuhan say they have not left their apartment for five days, that all transport has been stopped and there is no place to go and so we are pretty much stuck.Jason Neal and Sophie Hunt told BBC Breakfast said there had been no reassurance from the British authorities whom they have struggled to contact, possibly because of the time difference and them being closed over the weekend.They have about five days of food left and are keeping in touch with colleagues online while the scene outside is now like a ghost town.Mr Neal said: Even if the news is just to sit tight and nothing is going to change - I think it is just the silence that is disconcerting.We have not heard anything from outside of Wuhan for a week now.David Marland has lived and worked in Wuhan but returned to Britain last weekMathematics teacher David Marland, 34, told the  how he knew he had to call a doctor when he stepped off a plane at Gatwick Airport last week.For the past decade Mr Marland has lived and worked in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of a dangerous epidemic that shows few signs of slowing down.What’s more, Mr Marland lives only five minutes from the seafood market suspected to be the source of the virus, and walks through it nearly every day. Indeed a coronavirus case was recently confirmed in his apartment block.But when he called the NHS 111 helpline, as suspected carriers have been advised to do, the answer was unexpected.Instead of being called in immediately for a test, he says he was asked only if he had “the sniffles”. When he replied in the negative, the specialist on the other end of the line told him to call back if he started feeling unwell. With that, the conversation was over.Deadly coronavirus reaches Europe: in picturesOn Sunday, Mr Marland, 34, learned that the advice given to him may simply have been wrong. In a surprise announcement, Chinese officials suggested that carriers of coronavirus can actually spread the disease for up to two weeks without displaying any symptoms. If the Chinese are right, Mr Marland fears he and other potential carriers might be unwittingly carrying the deadly virus, and potentially spreading it to the public. Even his own relatives have asked him to stay away for fear of contracting the disease themselves.“I’m potentially a risk to other people,” he told the .“I’m still within the two week period so I could be spreading the disease everywhere without having any symptoms.”Passengers are being assessed at Changsha airport Numerous countries across the globe, including the UK, have introduced screening at airports in an attempt to identify people who may have coronavirus symptoms. But the limit here is that only those who are already ill will be picked up. So health experts say the most effective way to control the spread of viruses is an alert health system and high standards of infection control.Professor David Heymann, infectious disease expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that perhaps the most valuable element of airport screening is telling passengers about the signs and symptoms of a disease and what they should do if they’re worried.“Educating the public is key,” he told The .Chinese New Year revellers in London wore face masks to the celebrations amid the coronavirus fearsPeople wearing face masks have become a defining image of large disease outbreaks, and this one is no different, with cities in Asia already reporting shortages as masks fly off the shelves. But in reality, the thin material masks do little to stop a respiratory virus spreading. “The face masks that we see people wearing are surgical face masks,” said Dr Mark Parrish, regional medical director of the medical and travel security firm International SOS. “As you breathe in and out you\u0027re breathing air from outside the face mask. So it will stop a little bit but not hugely.”Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, added that face masks were proven to be effective in hospitals.Sanitary masks have become a defining image of large disease outbreaks“There are reports in literature that face masks in a hospital setting can protect health care workers. But there, they are being used for short periods by trained professions,changed frequently and properly disposed of. Those staff are also adopting good personal hygiene. “But in the general population it may even be the case that they’re not helpful at all,” he added.“If you don’t change them regularly enough, they could potentially start to trap viruses and eventually they can move through that mask into your respiratory tract.”  Dr Parrish added that heavy duty masks, called N95\u0027s, are far more effective than simple surgical masks for the general population. But these aren\u0027t fool-proof either. “These cause a tight seal around your nose and mouth so becomes harder to breathe air in - you don’t really want to give people with respiratory systems,” he said. Department for Health \u0026amp Social CareKobe Bryant, NBA legend, killed along with daughter in California helicopter crashBrexit latest news: Leo Varadkar compares trade talks to football and claims he\u0026#39s on the \u0026#39stronger team\u0026#39Groundhog Day: how the Punxsutawney Phil prediction at Gobbler\u0026#39s Knob forecasts the weatherFormer national security advisers say Huawei risks can be managed, as US ramps up pressureSuspected coronavirus carriers coming to the UK may not have been tested by mistakeCoronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China How will the Brexit transition period work?Brexit day: what happens after January 31?Trump did want to withhold Ukraine aid, John Bolton says, prompting calls for him to testify in impeachment trialSurge in prisoners serving life sentences makes overcrowding \u0026#39impossible\u0026#39 to end, says Cambridge studyThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayChinese premier Li Keqiang in Wuhan to lead emergency efforts as coronavirus deaths in China rise to 80  Monday morning news briefing: Kobe Bryant killed in air crashCouncils put climate emergency ahead of tackling deadly pollution, says studyComment: The baguette is on the brink, but the mushroom shows the way to a culinary comebackComment: As the Holocaust fades from living memory, it is more urgent than ever to teach its lessonsDuchess of Cambridge inspired by Anne Frank for Holocaust portraitsMatteo Salvini’s League party \u0026#39narrowly defeated in key regional elections\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/27/TELEMMGLPICT000222744794_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq15XUfPwoY7svuJOpueeorbXU7gd1mWUCWbCauCXAOdc.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"john bolton facing fresh calls testify impeachment trial amid","story":"John Bolton is under renewed pressure to testify in the president\u0026#39s impeachment trialThe US former national security advisor, John Bolton, is facing renewed pressure to testify in Donald Trump\u0027s impeachment trial after claims emerged the President told him he wanted to withhold security aid from Ukraine. In a forthcoming book, due to be published in March, Bolton apparently wrote that Trump admitted he wanted to keep back hundreds of millions of dollars until the country helped him with politically charged investigations, including into Democratic rival Joe Biden.Trump\u0027s legal team has repeatedly insisted that the president never tied the suspension of military assistance to the Ukraine to investigations that he wanted into Biden and his son.The account immediately gave Democrats new fuel in their pursuit of sworn testimony from Bolton and other witnesses, a question expected to be taken up later this week by the Republican-led Senate.The trial resumes this afternoon with arguments from Trump\u0027s defense team.Bolton\u0027s account was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the manuscript on the condition of anonymity to discuss the book, The Room Where It Happened A White House Memoir, ahead of its release March 17.Donald Trump denies telling Bolton he wanted to withhold military aid to UkraineWhen the Times report went online last night, the seven House Democratic managers immediately called on all senators to insist that Bolton be called as a witness and provide his notes and other relevant documents.Senator Chuck Schumer, the Senate\u0027s top Democrat, issued the same call.Trump denied the claims in a series of tweets early Monday. I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens, Trump said in a tweet.In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.Trump said people could look at transcripts of his call, and statements by Ukraine President Vlodymyr Zelinskiy that there was no pressure for such investigations to get the aid.Bolton, who acrimoniously left the White House a day before Trump ultimately released the Ukraine aid on September 11, has already told lawmakers that he is willing to testify, despite the president\u0027s order barring aides from cooperating in the probe.Bolton served in the Trump administration from April 2018 to September last yearAmericans know that a fair trial must include both the documents and witnesses blocked by the President that starts with Mr. Bolton, the impeachment managers said in a statement.First, though, Trump\u0027s legal team will begin laying out its case in depth, turning to several high-profile attorneys to argue against impeachment.The lawyers revealed the broad outlines of their defense in a rare but truncated Saturday session, where they accused House Democrats of using the impeachment case to try to undo the results of the last presidential election and drive Trump from office.The legal team is expected to pick up on that theme and also e into areas that received negligible attention during the Democrats\u0027 presentation, including the now-concluded investigation into ties between Russia and Trump\u0027s 2016 campaign.Trump\u0027s lawyers aren\u0027t expected to take as much time for their arguments as the Democrats, whose impeachment managers spoke for about 24 hours over three days.But they also don\u0027t need to: Acquittal is likely in a Senate where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, with a two-thirds vote needed for conviction.Still, they see an opportunity to counter the allegations, defend the powers of the presidency and prevent Trump from being weakened politically ahead of November\u0027s election.Trump faces two articles of impeachment. One accuses him of abusing his power by asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, his Democratic rival, at the same time that his administration withheld hundreds of millions of dollars from the country.The other alleges that Trump obstructed Congress by directing aides to not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The bank also hinted that it may relax\u0026nbspits focus on tackling high inflation as it deals with a combination of slowing productivity and an ageing population, as well as the legacy of the financial crisis.“As our economies are undergoing profound changes, it is the time for a strategy review to ensure we deliver on our mandate in the best interest of Europeans,\u0026nbspECB president Christine Lagarde said on Thursday.Interest rates in the eurozone have been close to zero for the past four years as inflation has stayed below the ECB’s 2 per cent target for almost all of the last nine years. Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also hinted that it may relax\u0026nbspits focus on tackling high inflation as it deals with a combination of slowing productivity and an ageing population, as well as the legacy of the financial crisis.“As our economies are undergoing profound changes, it is the time for a strategy review to ensure we deliver on our mandate in the best interest of Europeans,\u0026nbspECB president Christine Lagarde said on Thursday.Interest rates in the eurozone have been close to zero for the past four years as inflation has stayed below the ECB’s 2 per cent target for almost all of the last nine years. Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On one side, I’m very grateful that what I make can be acknowledged in a world like this, but also it sucks that whenever we – and I mean guys that look like me – do anything that’s genre-bending, they always put it in the rap or urban category.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I don’t like that ‘urban’ word, it’s just a politically correct way to say the ‘n’ word to me.”Created with Sketch.The 50 best albums of 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones.

(AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. He added: “So when I hear that I’m like, ‘Why can’t we just be in pop, do you know what I mean?’ Half of me feels like the rap nomination was a backhanded compliment, like, ‘Oh, my little cousin wants to play the game, let’s give him the unplugged controller so he can shut up and feel good about it.’Nick Jonas performed at Grammys with food in his teethAll the Grammys 2020 winnersThe 4 biggest talking points from the Grammy Awards 2020The artist’s win is his first-ever Grammy triumph after being nominated two other times, for Flower Boy in 2018 and as a feature on Frank Ocean’s Channel Orange in 2013.He performed at the ceremony at the Staples Centre\u0026nbspin Los Angeles and, shortly after the win, Jaden Smith,\u0026nbspwho has previously teased fans\u0026nbspabout the nature of his and Tyler’s relationship, tweeted: “My boyfriend just won a Grammy.”Tyler the Creator\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s not real. It’s speculative,” Norton told The Times. “There is no truth behind it, unless journalists know something more than I do.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe added: “It’s bizarre and quite flattering to be even considered in that world, but beyond that? Pure speculation.”Created with Sketch.19 films to look out for in 2020 Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s a depressing fact that films directed by previous winners have more chance of being nominated than those directed by newcomers.Because of this, the\u0026nbspbest film in any given year almost never wins the evening’s most coveted prize – in fact, it’s sometimes\u0026nbspnot even\u0026nbspnominated in the first place.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOver the decades, there have been countless glaring omissions\u0026nbsp– films that were nominated but were beaten by far inferior films\u0026nbspand classic films\u0026nbspthat failed to secure a single nomination.As the 2020 Oscars approach – a ceremony that’s fast becoming a two-horse race between a film that actually deserves the top prize (Parasite) and a film that does not (1917) – we’ve run through 20 brilliant films that you would have expected to be a\u0026nbspBest Picture winner, but weren’t.Click through the bellow gallery to see what films made the listCreated with Sketch.Oscars: 21 great films that never won Best Picture Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Long revered as one of the greatest films ever made, Orson Welles\u0027 debut – a film following newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane – was just another nominee back in the day, losing out to How Green Was My Valley. The Searchers may be considered John Ford\u0027s greatest film, but it was not treated as such back in the 1950s. In fact, the western starring John Wayne failed to earn a single nomination. Around the World in 80 Days turned out to be more the Academy\u0027s cup of tea.Not only did Alfred Hitchcock never win an Oscar (save for his memorial award in 1968), but neither did any of his films – one of which is Vertigo, a classic that won Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s once-a-decade greatest films of all time poll in 2012. If it had been nominated, it would have faced stiff competition in the form of eventual winner All About Eve.One of the films that kickstarted the New Hollywood Cinema era, The Graduate may have won director Mike Nichols an Oscar, but it ultimately lost out to Norman Jewison\u0027s In the Heat of the Night.  Stanley Kubrick\u0027s sci-fi classic remains one of the most influential pieces of cinema there is. The Academy didn\u0027t agree. The Academy nominated Kubrick for Best Director and awarded the visual effects in favour of considering 2001 for Best Picture (it didn\u0027t even get nominated). That year\u0027s winner was Oliver!, the musical by Carol Reed.Despite Taxi Driver\u0027s failure to win the main award, its nomination in four categories showed the Academy had good intentions. That All the President\u0027s Men and Network also lost out to eventual winner Rocky shows that, ultimately, it never really stood a chance.Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s ambitious Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now received a grand total of eight nominations, but only went home with two prizes (for cinematography and sound) losing out to drama Kramer vs. Kramer.Of all the Oscar blows dealt to Martin Scorsese over the decades, none landed harder than Raging Bull losing out to Robert Redford\u0027s weepie Ordinary People, an oversight many consider one of the Academy\u0027s most egregious.  Another sci-fi classic overlooked by the Oscars was Blade Runner, which didn\u0027t even get nominated in the Best Picture category (Gandhi ended up winning). Ridley Scott\u0027s The Martian went on to receive seven nominations in 2017 – evidence, perhaps, of the Academy taking responsibility for its past errors.1023 Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee\u0027s Do the Right Thing failing to win Best Picture at the 1990 Oscars is one thing – losing out to Driving Miss Daisy is another thing altogether.   Having awarded both The Godfather Part I and The Godfather Part II Best Picture in 1972 and 1974 respectively, the Academy seemed destined to appreciate Martin Scorsese\u0027s Goodfellas. But no – Kevin Costner\u0027s directorial debut Dances with Wolves was the most appealing choice for voters.New talent on the block Quentin Tarantino\u0027s second feature Pulp Fiction won him the coveted Palme d\u0027Or at Cannes in 1994 – a success he failed to match back on home turf. While he won an Original Screenplay Oscar, his film was beaten by Forrest Gump......and it wasn\u0027t the only one. Frank Darabont\u0027s adaptation of Stephen King\u0027s prison-set novella The Shawshank Redemption also fell victim to Robert Zemeckis\u0027 Oscar-friendly Forrest Gump. We don\u0027t see that film sitting atop the IMDb top 250 though, do we?If Heat was released today, there\u0027s no way it wouldn\u0027t be a Best Picture frontrunner. That it was completely ignored in favour of Braveheart is a huge travesty.You may think it was remiss of the Academy to shun Fargo, but it did come pretty close to winning, its chances bolstered somewhat by seven nominations and two wins (Actress for Frances McDormand and Original Screenplay for the Coen Brothers). It lost out to The English Patient.Having won Best Director five years previous for Schindler\u0027s List, Steven Spielberg was strongly expected to take home the top prizes for his Second World War epic. Cue Shakespeare In Love upsetting everybody.David Fincher\u0027s Facebook drama got shunned in favour of British patriotism in an Oscar two-horse race for the ages that ultimately saw The King\u0027s Speech crowned winner.1823 We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)Lynne Ramsay has directed two films that would have been deserving of Best Picture: You Were Never Really Here and this, We Need to Talk About Kevin. It\u0027s easy to see why Hollywood was temporarily more charmed by The Artist, but it\u0027s clear which film will stand the test of time.It\u0027s almost unthinkable to recall that the Coen brothers\u0027 Inside Llewyn Davis only scored two Oscar nominations in the cinematography and sound mixing categories, respectively. In the ensuing years, the film has been hailed as one of the greatest of the 2010s, meaning that its no-show at the Oscars will go down as one of the Academy\u0027s biggest omissions. Still, it would have had a hard time winning over 12 Years a Slave.For the 2015 Oscars race, you were either team Birdman or team Boyhood. Richard Linklater\u0027s labour of love, shot intermittently over 12 years, ultimately failed to win. If there\u0027s any justice, Andrea Arnold will one day become an Oscar winner, but in a perfect world, she would have already won for American Honey, a drama deserving of Best Picture if there ever was one.Horror rarely gets recognised at the Oscars, but Get Out is the closest the genre had come in years. Jordan Peele may have taken home the Best Original Screenplay award, but the stars aligned for Guillermo del Toro\u0027s fantasy The Shape of Water instead.Roma was strongly expected to become the first ever foreign language film to win Best Picture. It had everything going for it, including a standout festival run and universal acclaim. But then Green Book snatched its trophy away in a late stage awards season twist that still seems too ridiculous to be true.Long revered as one of the greatest films ever made, Orson Welles\u0027 debut – a film following newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane – was just another nominee back in the day, losing out to How Green Was My Valley. The Searchers may be considered John Ford\u0027s greatest film, but it was not treated as such back in the 1950s. In fact, the western starring John Wayne failed to earn a single nomination.

Ridley Scott\u0027s The Martian went on to receive seven nominations in 2017 – evidence, perhaps, of the Academy taking responsibility for its past errors.1023 Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee\u0027s Do the Right Thing failing to win Best Picture at the 1990 Oscars is one thing – losing out to Driving Miss Daisy is another thing altogether.   Having awarded both The Godfather Part I and The Godfather Part II Best Picture in 1972 and 1974 respectively, the Academy seemed destined to appreciate Martin Scorsese\u0027s Goodfellas. But no – Kevin Costner\u0027s directorial debut Dances with Wolves was the most appealing choice for voters.New talent on the block Quentin Tarantino\u0027s second feature Pulp Fiction won him the coveted Palme d\u0027Or at Cannes in 1994 – a success he failed to match back on home turf. While he won an Original Screenplay Oscar, his film was beaten by Forrest Gump......and it wasn\u0027t the only one. Frank Darabont\u0027s adaptation of Stephen King\u0027s prison-set novella The Shawshank Redemption also fell victim to Robert Zemeckis\u0027 Oscar-friendly Forrest Gump. We don\u0027t see that film sitting atop the IMDb top 250 though, do we?If Heat was released today, there\u0027s no way it wouldn\u0027t be a Best Picture frontrunner. That it was completely ignored in favour of Braveheart is a huge travesty.You may think it was remiss of the Academy to shun Fargo, but it did come pretty close to winning, its chances bolstered somewhat by seven nominations and two wins (Actress for Frances McDormand and Original Screenplay for the Coen Brothers). It lost out to The English Patient.Having won Best Director five years previous for Schindler\u0027s List, Steven Spielberg was strongly expected to take home the top prizes for his Second World War epic. Cue Shakespeare In Love upsetting everybody.David Fincher\u0027s Facebook drama got shunned in favour of British patriotism in an Oscar two-horse race for the ages that ultimately saw The King\u0027s Speech crowned winner.1823 We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)Lynne Ramsay has directed two films that would have been deserving of Best Picture: You Were Never Really Here and this, We Need to Talk About Kevin. It\u0027s easy to see why Hollywood was temporarily more charmed by The Artist, but it\u0027s clear which film will stand the test of time.It\u0027s almost unthinkable to recall that the Coen brothers\u0027 Inside Llewyn Davis only scored two Oscar nominations in the cinematography and sound mixing categories, respectively. In the ensuing years, the film has been hailed as one of the greatest of the 2010s, meaning that its no-show at the Oscars will go down as one of the Academy\u0027s biggest omissions. Still, it would have had a hard time winning over 12 Years a Slave.For the 2015 Oscars race, you were either team Birdman or team Boyhood. Richard Linklater\u0027s labour of love, shot intermittently over 12 years, ultimately failed to win. If there\u0027s any justice, Andrea Arnold will one day become an Oscar winner, but in a perfect world, she would have already won for American Honey, a drama deserving of Best Picture if there ever was one.Horror rarely gets recognised at the Oscars, but Get Out is the closest the genre had come in years. Jordan Peele may have taken home the Best Original Screenplay award, but the stars aligned for Guillermo del Toro\u0027s fantasy The Shape of Water instead.Roma was strongly expected to become the first ever foreign language film to win Best Picture. It had everything going for it, including a standout festival run and universal acclaim. But then Green Book snatched its trophy away in a late stage awards season twist that still seems too ridiculous to be true.The Oscars take place on 9 February.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The scientists hope to have a pilot factory producing the batteries within five years at the Berkeley site.The ultimate aim is to have a factory based at one of the former power stations in the South West that takes Carbon-14 isotopes directly from the graphite blocks for use in diamond batteries. This would significantly reduce the radioactivity of the remaining material, making it easier and safer to manage,” said Professor Tom Scott, director of the South West Nuclear Hub.With the majority of the UK’s nuclear power plants set to go offline in the next 10-15 years this presents a huge opportunity to recycle a large amount of material to generate power for so many great uses.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They shine so intensely that they challenge traditional astrophysical models, which have been unable to account for such a bright star.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow scientists think they have found the cause of the blazing brightness coming out of\u0026nbspSN\u0026nbsp2006gy. And they hope that it could shed light on where other such superluminous supernovae get their intensity from.The new breakthrough came when researchers discovered that the star gained its intense brightness when a normal supernova crashed into a shell of material that surrounded it.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

They suggested that vast amounts of iron could account for that particular line, as researchers call it – and when they tested that scenario, it worked.Scientists detect ‘unknown’ burst of gravitational waves in spaceIt became even more exciting when it quickly turned out that very large amounts of iron was needed to make the lines - at least a third of the Sun\u0027s mass - which directly ruled out some old scenarios and instead revealed a new one,\u0026nbspsaid Anders Jerkstrand from the Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University.The researchers suggest that before SN 2006gy\u0026nbspbecame what it is today, there was a double star made up of a white dwarf as big as Earth, and a huge hydrogen-rich massive star the size of our solar system. As the bigger star became even bigger, the smaller one was caught up in it and fell in towards the centre.When it got there, the white dwarf exploded into a Type Ia supernova – a normal supernova. That then collided with the envelope surrounding it, creating the giant collision that sent the light streaming across the universe.That a Type Ia supernova appears to be behind SN\u0026nbsp2006gy\u0026nbspturns upside down what most researchers have believed, says Anders\u0026nbspJerkstrand.That a white dwarf can be in close orbit with a massive hydrogen-rich star, and quickly explode upon falling to the centre, gives important new information for the theory of double star evolution and the conditions necessary for a white dwarf to explode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Maybe it’s because I was a Boy Scout.”Created with Sketch.Everything that led to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stepping down Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Thomas is the main witness for Associated Newspapers, owner of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, who are being sued by the duchess for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act.The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline published extracts from a “private and confidential” letter Meghan sent her father about their rift in February last year.Meghan’s lawyers claim the “true sentiment” of the letter was her concern about her father’s welfare and his exploitation by tabloid newspapers which he should stop talking to.Thomas Markle denies being ‘trashy’ and fears not seeing Meghan againSchillings law firm also claimed the portion of the letter that was printed by the Mail on Sunday “intentionally distorted or manipulated” its context to depict the duchess “negatively”.An extract from Meghan’s letter read: “Your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That means all her phone records, as well as mine. And I don’t think she wants that to happen.The publisher’s lawyers accused the duchess of being more concerned about the “unflattering” effect of the published letter extracts than any breach of her data protection rights.In court documents, the publisher also argues that an article in US People was sanctioned by the duchess and its effect “was to suggest that Mr Markle has made false claims about his dealings with his daughter and that he was entirely at fault in not attending the royal wedding and for the estrangement between himself and the claimant”.Can Prince Harry and Meghan Markle still use the Sussex Royal brand?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle fail in bid to trademark Sussex RoyalMeghan Markle doesn’t ‘owe’ her father a thing – despite what he saysThomas gave the Mail on Sunday access to the letter from his daughter after an US People article was published in which five anonymous people claiming to be Meghan’s “best friends” spoke about his relationship with Meghan.One friend said: “He’s never called he’s never texted. It’s super painful, because Meg was always so dutiful. I think she will always feel genuinely devastated by what he’s done.”Thomas said he went to the Mail on Sunday because he “wanted to defend myself for what was being said by those five people”.He added: “I think Meghan had a huge role in it. Now it is my obligation to turn up and give evidence.The letter Meghan sent to her father is believed to be the last communication between the pair, after their relationship completely broke down in the week of her wedding to Harry in May 2018.Mail on Sunday\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This can’t be delivered by tinkering around the edges or with short-term fixes.”Long-Bailey is not ‘continuity Corbyn’ candidate, Unite boss insistsThe proposal of a federal structure is one previously put forward by Mr Brown,\u0026nbspalthough the idea dates back to Winston Churchill more than a century ago.Sir Keir,\u0026nbspwho abandoned campaigning for four days after his mother-in-law suffered a serious accident,\u0026nbspwill not set out the details of the new structure, or of the powers to be devolved.Instead, he will call for the UK to follow other developed nations by drawing up a new written constitution, which would be devised by the “great and good”\u0026nbspin a constitutional convention.The idea is partly aimed at heading off the increasing\u0026nbsppossibility\u0026nbspof Scottish independence after Brexit, but also at recognising the desire of people across the UK for greater control of their lives, previously displayed in the vote to leave the EU.Created with Sketch.Who could replace Corbyn as Labour leader?

Hartlepool MP Mike Hill was this week revealed to be facing sexual assault and harassment claims, which he denies, in an employment tribunal.A new policy on dealing with sexual harassment allegations was adopted last year, following the publication of a #LabourToo dossier containing 43 anonymised stories of harassment within the party.Asked\u0026nbspabout the party’s handling of sexual harassment complaints, Ms Allin-Khan said: “I do know what it’s like to face harassment like that in the workplace\u0026nbspin my life – not in politics, in a previous work life – and it is horrific.“You dread coming to work every day.

Ian Murray, the party’s only Scottish MP, is also standing.The shadow sports minister\u0026nbspadmitted she was the least well-known candidate, but was still brimming with optimism and enthusiasm about the campaign.\u0026nbsp“I don’t believe in the word impossible,” she said.Labour leadership hustings cancelled as Starmer halts campaigningThornberry denies sneering at Brexit votersLeadership is hard- as the Labour candidates are suddenly finding outLisa Nandy’s attack on New Labour gives her a chance of victoryNandy attacks Blair’s New Labour for maintaining ‘Thatcher consensus’Raised by a single mother who worked multiple jobs to support her family, Ms Allin-Khan said her experience of growing up in poverty made her “incredibly relatable” to people struggling across the country.She has spoken of how a Labour government transformed her life, allowing her to study medicine at Cambridge despite failing her A-levels the first time around due to problems at home.Ms Allin-Khan, who also spent years delivering humanitarian aid in places such as Gaza, said: “There are people who are living lives that I’m very familiar with, unfortunately, and that gives me a fire in my belly that is almost impossible to replicate if you haven’t experienced cold and hunger and that loss of hope.”Factionalism and infighting within Labour only risk letting down communities that need the party most, she said, pointing to disunity as a factor in Labour’s election defeat.“When I was growing up, and we had one heater, which we moved from room to room, we didn’t care whether someone was left, right or centre,” Ms Allin-Khan said.“We just knew we needed a Labour government.”When December’s election result came in, she said she felt sick at the loss of so many colleagues and the scale of the defeat.But Ms Allin-Khan\u0026nbsprealised quickly she had to dust herself off to help Labour rebuild or risk the door closing “on an entire future generation of children and young people”.Starmer urged to ‘stand aside’ so Labour can have first woman leaderEither the\u0026nbspleader or the deputy of the party should be a woman, she argued, but she believed that a team of the best candidates was critical\u0026nbspto help\u0026nbspLabour out of “a difficult place”.Ms Allin-Khan, who is of Polish and Pakistani descent, would also like to see more ersity in the top jobs but said\u0026nbsp“we may not end up with that in this case”.Asked whether it should be someone outside of London, she said: “I think that the leadership, regardless of where they were born or live now or the seats they represent will be, and have to be willing to work across the whole country for the best interests of the whole country.”If elected, Ms Allin-Khan said she would continue to do shifts at St George’s Hospital in Tooting when she can – but admits she would be busy with her work as an MP and as a mother-of-two.She said: “An A\u0026ampE waiting rooms is like a microcosm of society. It’s all there in technicolour. You see the effects of poor social housing, of lack of job opportunities, cuts to the health service, it’s all there. “And that gives me credible argument, particularly when fighting for the NHS.”The new leader and deputy leader of the Labour Party will be announced on 4 April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She participated in both the Agricultural Training camp in December 2018 and spent 3 months at the Incubation camp where she learnt how to transform her crops.A dry inlet bed at Mandina near Sedhiou, where cattle once grazed the lush vegetation on the banks – now all that remains are their footprints and hoof marksAlima, 31, says her ancestors have always been farmers: “My mother, my grandmother and my great grandmother all were, but they farmed very differently. They would grow rice, maize and millet only, whereas we are choosing what is easier for us to grow. We can now make more profit than in the past.” Cezi, 29, lives in Carounate, near Ziguinchor. Her father was killed in 1995 during the conflict when she was just 4 years old. “A lot of people were killed on the same day in my area, houses were destroyed and several families were forced to move away. “My schooling was affected – I felt ashamed when the others talked about their fathers and I didn’t have one. It all affected my studies.” She explains how hard the period was for her family, in particular her mother. “She used to drink alcohol as she said it was the only way to forget the ‘bad souvenirs’ (memories) from that day.” Cezi is one of 11 family members at home.The Ampa Awagna project since its introduction in 2017 has trained 354 students in agricultural techniques and empowered 90 participants with the knowledge and skill to start their own companies. Projects like these are monumental in a region where 72 per cent of young people live on less than £1.50 per day. Famatou, 32, lives in the village of Saleykegna. She has struggled in the past to provide enough food for her family to eat. She explained how she had heard the Ampa Awagna project was providing small scale farmers with improved techniques growing crops to increase yields. Since her training, her onions have doubled in size and she has the ability to earn well and provide for her five children. “I get one production and I can earn 35,000 CFA (£54). I’m very happy now that my vegetable garden is doing better. I hope it will continue to be successful, otherwise, this will affect my family, I just love to see my garden grow.”Aida, 36, lives in Takou village, near Sedhiou. She has five children and is 8 months pregnant but still works tirelessly on her small holding and with her chickens. The family only eat twice a day but Aida has a business plan to grow her poultry farm. “My mother used to grow rice and peanuts just for food. People still do grow these here but only in the rainy season, which is very short. Lydie, 25, lives in Boukitingho near Ziguinchor. She attended the Ampa Awagna Y CareYMCA course and learned how to upscale the vegetables she grows by turning produce from the market into syrup, juice and marmalade. This enables her to earn a more consistent income the whole year-round. She is already teaching other women in the village the new skills she learned at the course. “We have a joint piece of land in the village where we can grow our crops, and there we grow carrots, salad, onions and maize.Y Care International, the YMCA’s aid and development charity, is empowering young women across the world and is supporting a programme in Senegal to address youth unemployment and help the next generation of farmers adapt to climate change. Beneficiaries like Fatou are able to create sustainable lives for themselves and their families.Bouya, 23, lives in a village on the outskirts of Kolda. An orphan, she lost both her parents to illness. Until now Bouya has been totally dependent on her uncle for support. “I’ve just completed the agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna and I am now planning to develop my own smallholding. The plot of land belonged to my father.  My idea is to start growing okra, lettuce, tomato and cucumber – okra is a great crop because it is resistant to the heat.Laurentine, 26, runs a smallholding of pigs near Kolda. She is using the new farming methods she learnt on the Ampa Awangna camp and is extremely positive about the future. “Before the training, we used traditional methods. The programme taught me the modern way is to keep them in the shelter as when they wander around they can bring back diseases”. She now has 40 pigs and hopes in the next 10 years to move to a much larger holding where she wants 200-300 pigs.Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Having excelled at the initial 2-week agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna, Belange was asked to complete the 50-day intensive agricultural camp. She explained: “When I returned, I started growing in my vegetable garden, rearing pigs and poultry. I am earning much more than I did before the training. I’m growing tomatoes, peppers and chillis and I have much more output. Our life is better now – we don’t need to get help from others or have to ask people for money.”Khady, 32, watering her crops of Aubergine and Ochre near Ziguinchor. Watering the crops to ensure they produce the best yields takes several hours a day.A beneficiary of the Y CareYMCA Ampa Awagna, Belange, 23 stands marking the spot, where the rice harvest should have reached. The deficit in rice crop yields (the staple diet) reported by several farmers or total crop-losses due to inconsistent rainfall have pushed vulnerable households with depleted food stocks to begin using negative coping strategies such as decreasing the number of meals per day for the family. Alphonse George Manga, regional executive secretary for YMCA Senegal, explained: “We are in a changing world, we can’t stay in the past. For this century things are changing for the better for women. I think in the future there will be a role reversal. Where previously, women were required to stay at home, they are now far more skilled and empowered. They can do and be whatever they want if they are just given a chance and a little bit of help.”Fatou, 30, comes from a family of farmers approximately 20km away from the village of Bousra where she now lives with her son Ibu. Her husband grows rice during the rainy season and the rest of the time performs duties as a marabou (fortune teller). Djifanghor, 27, is a single mother who lives alone in the village of Niaguis with her mother. After her father died in 2008 her eldest brother was forced to work away to protect the family income. Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Her parents have always traditionally farmed rice \u0026amp peanut crops but have noticed the rainy season is unstable – sometimes there is more rain and sometimes there is not enough. Elie, 27, along with her family fled Oussouye in the Ziguinchor Region of Senegal in 1998 at the height of the conflict. She recalls stories of how the rebel groups lit fuel around shelters and make-shift homes and those residents who tried to escape were shot. “I still hear the crying and screams of those who perished … that is still what I have in my mind”.

They can do and be whatever they want if they are just given a chance and a little bit of help.”According to estimates from UN agencies, the conflict in Casamance, Senegal, claimed the lives of over 5,000 people. The Movement of Democratic Forces in Casamance (MFDC) emerged in 1982 as an armed separatist group advocating for independence, creating a guerilla force who began attacks on the Senegalese army in 1990.In lower Casamance, 78 villages were completely destroyed, creating\u0026nbspover 60,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) and subjected them to a life of fewer opportunities. Tens of thousands also crossed borders seeking refuge in Guinea-Bissau and the Gambia.Although an eventual ceasefire was implemented in 2014, today few MFDC combatants remain and violent incidents are in decline. The fear of sporadic attacks has now been replaced by far greater fears of youth unemployment and food insecurities driven by the changing climate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHigh levels of poverty and hunger persist in Senegal despite solid economic growth in recent years. Chronic malnutrition affects\u0026nbspapproximately 17 per cent of children younger than 5 years of age, according to the UN World Food Program.Countries in the Sahel who rely on agriculture as primary sources of food and income are most at risk of crises and disasters.

They are defying\u0026nbspwhat predominantly male farming practices\u0026nbsphave done for generations and are adapting to the climate changes.Most Senegalese\u0026nbsphave noticed changes in the weather and seasons – they talk of drought, increases in temperature and distinctly shorter rainy seasons but most do not draw the connection with global climate change.Y Care International, the YMCA’s aid and development charity, is empowering young women across the world and is supporting a programme in Senegal to address youth unemployment and help the next generation of farmers adapt to the climate crisis.Leigh Daynes, CEO for Y Care International, explains:\u0026nbsp“The high unemployment and poverty levels experienced by young people in this remote and rural area of Casamance have only been further exacerbated by climate change.

The video has since gone viral and the oil worker shared an update on the kittens’ health.Writing on Facebook, Mr Diwisch said: “So today I found these three fellows on one of the back roads near one of my wells. Most likely dropped off. Poor things were frozen into the ice so they had to have been there all night.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“All three little rascals went to their new home today where they get to be together instead of separating them. All three are eating and drinking and very energetic. Thanks for everyone’s consideration and offering to take them very appreciated.”The video, captured last Wednesday, shows Mr Diwisch approaching the poor kittens in the snow. He can be heard talking on camera, saying: “Look at these little guys. It’s alright, it’s ok. You’re frozen to the ice. Have you been here all night?”One of the cats is free but his friends have their tails frozen to the ground. Once Mr Diwisch sees this he goes to his truck, brings back warm coffee, pours it on the felines and is able to get them free.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

announced they would be evacuating citizens from Wuhan ​by plane\u0026nbspwithin days.Behind the scenes, Downing Street has accepted that some form of airlift will be necessary if the trapped Britons are to leave, but appeared some way from reaching an agreement with the Chinese authorities.One source described the issue as being “how” they are evacuated, not whether, and acknowledged the challenge of trying to reach people spread out across a wide area.“We are talking about hundreds of people in the province, rather than just in Wuhan city itself,” the source told The Independent.However, ministers are encouraged by the news on the domestic front, with all 52 people so far tested for the virus in the UK found to have negative results.Only the best news in your

But he added: “What we don’t know is how far it’s going to spread, that really is something we need to plan for all eventualities.”China’s national health commission revealed the disease’s ability to spread is getting stronger and infections could continue to rise. A handful of cases of infection have been reported in other countries, including Thailand, Australia, the United States, France and Canada, although no fatalities have been recorded outside China.The newly-identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.\u0026nbspBritons urged to leave Wuhan but ministers won\u0027t commit to airliftsFrance to evacuate citizens from China’s Wuhan amid coronavirus fearsLatest China travel updates as coronavirus outbreak worsensCoronavirus: Hong Kong protesters set fire to planned quarantine buildIt can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.Health minister Ma Xiaowei said the virus can be infectious during its incubation period – before symptoms show – which ranges from one to 14 days.China has temporarily banned live animal trade across the country in markets, supermarkets, restaurants and online.Any place breeding wildlife should be isolated\u0026nbspand the transportation of wildlife should be suspended, the country’s market watchdog, agricultural ministry, and forestry bureau said in a joint statement. It comes after the virus was traced to a seafood market in Wuhan believed to have been illegally selling live animals.The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) director-general was on his way to Beijing to confer with Chinese officials and health experts about the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday.In a tweet, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he wanted to “strengthen our partnership” with China “in providing further protection against the outbreak”.\u0026nbspThe Geneva-based WHO also said editors of major scientific journals had agreed to share any papers about the new coronavirus with it before publication, with authors’ consent, and that this would help inform its assessment and guidance.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Meanwhile, Britons remaining in Wuhan, the Chinese province at the centre of the outbreak, have been urged to leave the area if they are able to do so.Priti Patel, the home secretary, has said the government was “looking at all options” to help Britons leave Wuhan following reports officials have been asked to examine the logistics for an airlift from the city.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollow the latest updatesDeath toll rises to 80Some 17 cities with more than 50 million people placed on lockdownMore than 50 people test negative for virus in UKBritons in Chinese province at centre of outbreak urged to evacuateJeremy Hunt has suggested airlifts for UK citizens in China and warned of the pressure the coronavirus could put on the NHS.\u0026nbspAsked if he supported flying Britons back from Wuhan and elsewhere, the former foreign secretary told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: I think I would be very sympathetic and I\u0027m sure the Foreign Office would be too.He said the NHS was well-equipped to deal with patients returning with the virus but warned it could strain the service.This is a very difficult time of year for the NHS - it is the most difficult time. But, again, my experience is that the NHS does know how to cope with these kinds of emergencies.I think the thing that will be difficult is the knock-on impact on other NHS services, he said.I think it would be very, very challenging for the NHS in terms of the regular workload but I have absolutely no doubt that, when it comes to doing what comes to necessary to isolate the virus and keep the public safe, our doctors and nurses will do exactly what they need to do.Health officials are continuing to track down around 2,000 people who have recently flown into the UK from Wuhan, the area of China worst affected by the outbreak.The Department of Health\u0026nbspconfirmed it is trying to find as many passengers as we can who arrived from the region in the past two weeks to check on their wellbeing.It is understood Border Force officers have been recruited to help speed up the search for passengers as testing for the virus continues in the UK.A public health hub has been set up in Heathrow, staffed by a rotating team of seven clinicians working in shifts to support patients on arrival.One academic has said his best guess was that 100,000 people had been infected by the coronavirus.\u0026nbspProfessor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, told : There are very large numbers of Chinese tourists across Europe right now.Unless the Chinese manage to control this, and I\u0027m sceptical about whether that is possible, we will get cases here.The Foreign Office has confirmed it is working on making an option available for British nationals to leave Wuhan in the Hubei province in China.British citizens in the region have been told to call the FCO on (+86) (0) 10 8529 6600 or (+44) (0)207 008 1500 should they need assistance.\u0026nbspA spokesperson said: We continue to monitor developments closely and are in close touch with the Chinese authorities. The safety and security of British nationals is always our primary concern.Britons trapped in the Chinese province at the centre of the outbreak have been urged to leave the area if they are able to do so.The Foreign Office updated its guidance to advise against all travel to Hubei province, which has been on lockdown for several days as China seeks to contain the illness.But the guidance also added: If you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so. This is due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak.Priti Patel, the home secretary, said the government was looking at all options to help Britons leave Wuhan following reports that officials have been asked to examine the logistics for an airlift from the city.Public Health England\u0027s medical director, Dr Yvonne Doyle, has told Sky News she suspects there were already cases of cornavirus in the UK.\u0026nbspBut she said the country was well-prepared.\u0026nbspSome 52\u0026nbsppeople have now been tested for coronavirus in the UK as of Sunday afternoon, according to the Department of Health (DoH), although all tests have returned negative.\u0026nbspEngland\u0027s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said there was a fair chance cases would emerge in Britain as the overall number reported around the world climbed to about 2,744.The death toll from the coronavirus has risen to 80 as China expanded efforts to contain the viral disease by extending the Lunar New Year holiday to keep the public at home.\u0026nbspA total of 17 cities with more than 50 million people have been placed on lockdown in the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Prince Charles will see to that.Harry will continue to receive £million from his father, but although Charles has amassed a personal fortune of over £million, the money might not be coming from that closely guarded pot.The prince could instead be paying him through a outdated racket called the Duchy of Cornwall.Charles could claim this as a business expense which means he can reduce the amount of tax he pays. The public would be paying for Harry by the back door.Harry of course has no connection with this sprawling property company called the Duchy, but that has never stopped Charles benefiting from its special tax status.The status of the Duchy has been contested for decades and while Charles insists it is private, thats strongly disputed by others.Charles has also claimed as business expenses the cost of  personal staff to pamper him – butlers, valets, gardeners.He had the cheek to argue that Camilla’s personal costs even before they married were a Duchy expense so claimed for her staff, her travel, her jewellery, and the stabling of her horses.And he got away with it. The line was only drawn when he tried to claim his polo ponies as business expenses.In my time in Parliament I saw plenty of MPs claiming for duck houses, moat cleaning and the like. Is this dferent So what is this Duchy  Well it’s not just in Cornwall where it has land. Its tentacles stretch far and wide. It even owns the Oval cricket ground. Extra cover for the Prince as he hits the taxpayer for six.The Duchy turns in a profit of over £million a year. That is money that many argue should go straight to the Treasury. Instead it becomes pocket money for the Prince.He has reluctantly agreed he should pay tax on this money but the vast array of creative expenses he conjures up means in a recent year when the Duchy made £.million, only £.million was paid in tax at  per cent.That can only be explainedhe dreamed up more than £million in expenses.Charles says the Duchy is a “private estate” — which it is legally, but it acts like a public body that reverts to the Crown when theres no Duke of Cornwall.It has had notices served on it by the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency and they can only be served on a public body.It is the harbour authority for the Isles of Scilly. The Information Commissioner has ruled it is public.But by insisting it is private means the Duchy’s accounting practices can be hidden away. No right of access for the National Audit Office. No freedom of information.If you go cap in hand and bow and scrape, they might let you see some old Duchy paperwork. On the other hand, they might not.In this medieval throwback, Charles scoops up the property of anybody who dies without leaving a will. The general right for a King or Queen to do this was abolished in . But not in the Duchy.Yet this so-called private estate suddenly becomes public when it suits Charles. Unlike any other private estate in Britain, it doesn’t pay any corporation tax or capital gains tax.No wonder Charles is worth over £million.Suddenly the private Prince becomes a public figure, demanding – and getting – the right to change government legislation that affects the Duchy in a way he doesn’t like.To be fair, he does pay the market rent for the vast property he occupies at Highgrove. He pays it to the Duchy which then s the money to him, tax-free, as the Duke of Cornwall in a sort of merry money-go-round.He got Duchy employees to grow trees on Duchy land and then sold the timber to... The Duchy. Charles pocketed £.million tax free for this racket.The Duchy of Cornwall is not some hobby growing a bit of organic lettuce here and there. Nor is it a small collection of twee cottages as you might infer from the pictures the Duchy uses in its publications.No, it is a hard-headed ruthless property company with advantages in tax and law that no other company has.It is a massive money-making machine for Prince Charles, money that rightly belongs to us all but that he erts to himself.It’s time for this medieval monstrosity to be sorted out. As Margaret Thatcher once famously said: “We want our money back.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The project is already massively over budget, it may well break the £billion mark soon, and running a decade late.A row about what to do about it is brewing in the Tory party.“HS is building up to be quite a serious disagreement within the party,” says one leading backbencher.Birmingham Tories are keen to save the scheme, believing it to be key to the re-election prospects of their West Midlands Mayor Andy Street.One argument they are deploying is that going ahead with HS would make it easier for the Government to scrap the third runway at Heathrow.They point out that when David Cameron backed the scheme while the Tories were in opposition, it was, in part, as an alternative to Heathrow expansion.Given that Boris Johnson has said he would lie down in front of the bulldozers before he allowed a third runway to be built, it would be extremely embarrassing for himthe project proceeded.But for a Prime Minister, who boasts of his commitment to infrastructure, to scrap two of the biggest transport projects in the country would be politically dficult. This might well be what saves HS, in some form.This Government knows what it wants to do.But the real challenge is actually delivering on this agenda, of ensuring that, when Boris Johnson pulls the levers, something happens.I UNDERSTAND that Boris Johnson is keen to amalgamate the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office this year.His experience as Foreign Secretary has left him convinced that you need to align the two departments.The UK will, though, remain committed to spending . per cent of national income on foreign aid.In preparation for this beefed-up role for the Foreign Office, I’m told Rob Oxley – the Prime Minister’s Press Secretary – is heading there to work for Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary.Oxley was with Boris and Dominic Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign before working with them in Downing Street.He is a trusted member of their team and his presence in the Foreign Office will ensure smooth relations between Downing Street and the FCO.He is also across the international issues, having previously been a special adviser at both the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.KEIR STARMER is out in front in the Labour leadership race.He has four times as many nominations from constituency Labour parties as any other candidate. Right now, this race is his to lose.If Starmer does win, it will consolidate a change in British politics. He will find it easier to squeeze Liberal Democrat voters in the south than to win back those Leave voters Labour have lost in the Midlands and the North in recent years. Labour’s sht to being a party of urban graduates will continue under him.The problem for Labour is that this approach simply will not win them enough seats to govern.In a generation’s time, it may well work. But not now. Starmer’s supporters argue that he comes without Jeremy Corbyn’s baggage and that many of the voters Labour lost at the last election will come back to the party as soon as they are offered a credible leader. This, though, seems an optimistic reading of events.One supporter of another candidate claims that the sense Starmer “looks the part” and “you can imagine him as PM” is just because he is a man. “Never underestimate the sexism of the Labour party,” she complains.NIGEL FARAGE will vote for the withdrawal agreement when it comes before the European Parliament next week. Farage had previously been a trenchant critic of the deal.He has described it as “awful”, “ per cent the same as Mrs May’s deal” and “a Remainer’s Brexit”. But he’s been convinced by the Government’s statements about how it doesn’t intend to be a rule-taker after Brexit.For this reason – and because it would look absurd for him to vote against Brexit – he will now back the deal. Farage plans to leave UK politics on January . But he intends to keep a watching brief, saying he is prepared toto the frayBoris Johnson’s government pulls back from its current position.Farage’s experience with the Brexit Party, which went from launch to topping the poll in the European elections in a matter of weeks, has persuaded him that new political parties can have an instant impact when required.THE row over a potential peerage for John Bercow is not going to go away. He is claiming he is entitled to one.But the Government is keen to stop the former Speaker getting one given how he twisted parliamentary procedure to aid those MPs who were trying to block Boris Johnson on Brexit.Meanwhile, the former chief clerk of the House of Commons, Lord Lisvane, has made a formal complaint alleging that Bercow bullied staff.One MP who Bercow appointed to the  of chairs tells me the most likely outcome to the row is that the House of Lords Appointments Commission does not accept Jeremy Corbyn’s nomination of Bercow.But rather than rejecting it outright, it will say “not now” and insist that all proceedings relating to Bercow’s alleged bullying are dealt with before a decision is made on whether he can go to the Lords or not.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Network Rail wants to move a mile-long stretch of track that runs beside a beach in Devon, saying it’s vulnerable to falling rocks AND pounding waves.Protesters say this is nonsense, and they’re right. Simple as.Yes, the track is vulnerable. In  it was destroyed by a storm and, while it was being repaired, Cornwall was effectively cut off from the rest of the country.But this bit of track, designed and built by Brunel, is extremely pretty and charming and that, in the coming years, is going to matter more than a few Corns being cut off for a week or two.As we leave Europe, we have in our minds that we will be a modern, dynamic nation with magnetic levitation transportation systems linking all the towns and villages. We see glass towers piercing the clouds in Rochdale and space ports in Basingstoke.Ain’t going to happen.If we decide that everything old-fashioned and historical must go to make le more modern, then we can wave goodbye to the Tower of London, because that piece of real estate should obviously be sold to commercial developers.They say the submersibles these people use are causing “untold damage” to the ship.Hmm. Not half as much damage as the iceberg did, I’ll wager.The Roman walls in York  Stupid. Replace them with nuclear free peace cafes. Stonehenge  Smash it up and build polytunnels.And while we are at it, we can turn Portmeirion into a wind farm, capitalise on the crescent in Bath with advertising hoardings and replace all the dry stone walls in the Yorkshire Dales with plastic fencing.Oh, and then there’s the Royal Family.It’s obviously idiotic to have a system of government where you can become head of state just because you’re the first-born child of a German woman and a Greek man. So let’s get rid of that and have a president instead. That way, we could have someone we know in Buckingham Palace. Piers Morgan perhaps. Or Phillip Schofield.The fact is that Britain is a boutique.Millions of foreign visitors come every year to marvel at our pomp and tradition. They love our changing of the guard, and our castles and our awkward Elizabethan houses. They laugh at us when we try to be modern but lap up our Rolls-Royces and our Bentleys which are made, by Germans, to feel as old-fashioned as the Queen’s underwear drawer.We send a young, fresh band to the Eurovision Song Contest and it comes last. Then the judges go home to listen to The Beatles and The Who.We need to capitalise on that. We need the red telephone boxes back. We need warty peasants on every street corner and lots of men tipping their bowler hats when they see a lady.Because then, tourists will be queuing round the block to give us their dollars and their dongs.And we can start by leaving that pretty bit of railway line in Devon alone.Yes, it’ll mean that from time to time Cornwall will be cut off. But I’m willing to bet a lot of Corns won’t mind that. Because being isolated and stuck and hungry is part of what we are as well.This week she stood still and insisted Prince Charles crossed the room to greet her. And after they had shaken hands and exchanged pleasantries, she turned to the photographers and called a halt to proceedings.I’m not sure she had a clue who Charlie Boy was. But then she doesn’t have much of a clue about anything.A FEW weeks ago, many people were upset when I suggested that God had set fire to Australia.I realise now that this was a stupid thing to say. Of course God did not set fire to it. The Green movement did.Yes, climate change causes longer, hotter spells that increase the likelihood of a fire starting. But what made it became so huge was ill-informed eco thinking.In recent years, Australians have faced huge finesthey cut down a tree or even collect fallen branches.This means that when a fire starts, it has a ton of dry wood to get its teeth into. The Aboriginals understood this. The early white settlers did too. That’s why they had controlled fires to manage the land properly.Sadly, though, ecomentals don’t understand this.So, by trying to save the country’s wildle, they’ve ended up incinerating it.However, it turns out that Land Rover was able to work out that, on the night in question, the car had been at the scene.Obviously, it’s great that technology can be used in this way. But I have a Range Rover and I’m not sure I like thinking that some herbert in Solihull knows where I am  hours a day. CHANNEL  News achieved new heights of unbalanced reporting this week while covering a pro-gun march in America.Instead of asking protesters why they wanted a machine gun, and then allowing the viewer to make up their mind, the reporter pounced on a family and asked the children why they were there.Needless to say, the kids had no clue and turned in baffled silence to their parents.I’m willing to bet, however, thatyou asked kids on an eco march why they were there, you’d get exactly the same response.But would Channel  News do that  Don’t hold your breath.I told the woman my name was Jeremy Clarkson. I told her the name on my credit card was Jeremy Clarkson. And that my account was in the name of Jeremy Clarkson.And when I’d finished, she said, with some excitement: “Hey!!

Foreign students will get two years to find a job after graduating.And a new points-based system will keep us open to the brightest and best.Unskilled migrants will be filtered out — but they will get more points for working in an industry short of labour.We DO want lower overall migration. The pressure on wages, the NHS, housing and so on is unsustainable.But it is already sharply down on . And even the prospect of ending free movement has dramatically relegated immigration in the list of the nation’s priorities.We MUST, though, be far tougher on illegals who reach our shores, and vastly increase the tiny percentage we deport.That will end the deadly trafficking racket. And none are genuine refugees — or they would stay put in the EU which, as tearful Europhiles will tell you, is a welcoming, safe, liberal paradise.Britain must continue to rescue real refugees from warzone camps.Economic migrants from the EU, like everywhere , can come in on merit.THE Government is right to condemn America over Harry Dunn.It is taking our special relationship for granted.It tries to bully us over taxes on its tech giants, issues threats over Huawei and outrageously hides a death crash driver. Britain is right to push back.The US insists Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity. But it could rescind that. It simply refuses.President Trump presumably thinks he must side with US citizens come what may. But most of them also believe Mrs Sacoolas should face justice.She won’tvoluntarily. She doesn’t want to — and says a potential jail term wouldn’t be “proportional”.That is for a judge to decide. Mrs Sacoolas’s apparent negligence killed a young man. Even accidents have consequences.If she or Trump have any sense of right and wrong, she will be flown back.THE historic Brexit Bill is signed off. In less than a week we will be out.It is an extraordinary achievement by Boris Johnson and his team, though trade talks will still be challenging.One thing bothers us. Why does the EU still let Michel Barnier run the show His error, in plotting with Remainers trying to stop us leaving, ultimately triggered the “hard Brexit” they feared.That same ill-judged pig-headedness now could jeopardise entire industries.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All good stuff.The only toxic fly in the Fair Trade, ethically sourced, organic ointment was that Charles flew to Switzerland in a private jet, emitting around six tons of carbon dioxide.There are excuses. Or,you are being generous, reasons.Charles was on his way to Israel and Palestine, where security concerns make commercial flights unviable.But after all of Charles’ fine words on climate change, the use of a private jet sent a dferent message.He was campaigning to save the planet decades before that was fashionable. But whatever the merits of his beliefs on climate change, the brutal fact is that establishment hypocrisy makes most people reach for the mute button.The nation’s honeymoon with Harry and Meghan did not end because we are racist bigots who could never accept a mixed-race woman in the Royal Family.Harry and Meghan were adored.They broke the spell when they wagged their virtuous fingers about climate change while hopping on and off private jets. It was their establishment hypocrisy that killed our love.One law for them and another for us. That makes people switch off.It isn’t complicated. You can fly by private jet OR you can lecture the world about saving the planet.But you can’t do both. Isn’t that screamingly obvious The Royal Family are not the only establishment hypocrites. Labour’s Emily Thornberry — Lady Nugee, a champion of the working man — thinks we should all send our children to the local comprehensive school.Even though, Lady Nugee confessed to Andrew Neil, that’s not what she chose for her own children.Establishment hypocrite.Harry and Meghan abandoned this country claiming they long for “financial independence”. Yet the millionaire couple always seem quite content to have some poor sucker sponsoring their lavish lestyle.There is no way Canadians will foot the bill for Harry and Meghan’s security.It is not politically possible for any Canadian PM to foist that expense on to their taxpayers.Ex-Mountie Larry Busch, who in the past has protected the royals in Canada, predicts the job will take  full-time officers and cost in excess of £.million a year.Who is going to pay for that  The “financially independent” Harry and Meghan  No chance.I can see it now. Mounties will do the heavy lting and British taxpayers will get the bill. THAT is why we went right off Harry and Meghan — their rank establishment hypocrisy.We have been endlessly told Harry and Meghan plan to refund us for the eye-watering £.million it cost to do up Frogmore Cottage, the beautul home in Windsor they no longer need or want.A refund I will believe it when I see it.Can we get a receipt THE Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Bill received Royal Assent from the Queen on Thursday. After all the years of pain and paralysis, it was finally official.The UK is leaving the European Union.Yet this historic moment did not even warrant a mention on the BBC’s Six O’Clock News.Incredible.And conclusive proof that the BBC no longer speaks for the nation.So the new Director-General of the Beeb has an existential problem.Because everyone at the corporation voted Remain, the largest vote for anything in our history – leaving the EU – has been treated as the ignorant spasm of .million uneducated, racist bigots.From crappy little comedy- shows to prestige news and current affairs, the BBC has been unapologetically biased against Brexit.The state broadcaster should be scrupulously neutral.In recent years, the BBC has been brazenly partisan.Look, we all have fond memories of growing up with the BBC. But this week I watched football on Sky and BT, drama on Amazon Prime and Netflix.None of the sport and drama I craved was on the BBC.Feeling nostalgic for Top Of The Pops and Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads  is not worth £. a year.The BBC is nakedly biased. And the BBC is increasingly irrelevant. So why does it still get £billion a year from the licence fee WITH Cats bombing at the box office, many of the cast are desperately distancing themselves from the furry turkey, including James Corden, who says he has not even seen the film.The exception is Taylor Swt, who says she has “no complaints”, adding: “I had a really great time working on that weird-ass movie.”But Taylor understands there are greater problems in le than having a flop at the box office.In an essay to mark her th birthday, she writes about her mother’s brain tumour.“Both my parents have had cancer and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again,” Taylor writes.“It’s taught me there are real problems and then there’s everything .”There is nothing like the loss of a loved one’s health to put le’s little knocks into perspective.THE president of the Durham Miners’ Gala sneers that he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than allow newly elected Tory MPs to attend.Alan Mardghum says: “ did their best to destroy the Durham miners and the miners of Great Britain.”Does Mardghum honestly believe the mediocre Marxist muppets of today’s Labour Party have any interest in his community The Labour Party of today openly despises the British working class.That’s why so many ex-miners voted Tory.The proud, hardworking, patriotic communities of the North East have realised the Tories are now the party of the working class.If Alan Mardghum can’t see that, then he is dead in a ditch already.

She gives her take on how an inability to retain independence left Meghan feeling vulnerable.Jo also reveals how free-spirited Meghan was not always able to make the compromises necessary to accept the constraints of royal le and analyses the “boyfriend shirt” she wore when first dating Harry . . . plus the Hamsa ring she put on to ward off evil.I ALWAYS feel deeply unsettled when my own feelings of love, goodwill and optimism are turned on a sixpence in exchange for scepticism, cynicism and disappointment.It indicates very strongly that I feel cheated and, perhaps worst of all, fooled.It is no exaggeration to say that this has been the personal rollercoaster of emotions I have been on with Meghan and Harry.I vividly remember standing in my garden that sweltering day during May , looking through the living-room window to watch their royal weddingand welling up with the emotion and promise of it all.Strangely, I don’t recall experiencing the same when William and Kate married seven years earlier, but there was something truly signicant about Meghan joining The Firm.She signied new, fresh, modern, showbizzy blood — and abundant, gracious, progressive attitudes.Above all , the love they had for each other was palpable.Perhaps I should already have been exercising some caution with my enthusiasm when Harry fired warning shots across the media about the treatment of his girlfriend and the supposed racist undertones.But I, for one, felt utterly encouraged and buoyant about this woman’s humility, dignity, compassion and empathy.What could possibly go wrong Now,  months down the line, I cannot deny I feel hoodwinked — and can well imagine that is how much of the population feels.As a nation of welcoming Brits , it is like we invited Meghan into our adorable, unpretentious and homely BB. She stayed for dinner, took the complimentary soaps and shampoos then walked out in search of the nearest hotel.Regardless of how they want to dress it up, the two of them have turned their backs on the UK and it feels like a kick in the teeth.What really stings is that it does not feel like it was a long-term plan, but it simply came about when Meghan re-read the membership rules, months after signing on the dotted line, and decided it cramped her style. I’m pretty certain all the statutes will have been made clear to her from the start, many times over. Everything will have been scrutinised and pored over in minute detail. The Royal Family is a watertight institution, after all.But propelled by her personal ambition, and presumably a wilfulness to reform the family, becoming a royal would not only give her a  for her humanitarian work but also fame on a level she would have been unlikely to have otherwise ever achieved.What she could not cope with was her loss of control and the fact that being part of a team inevitably means diminished autonomy.But some of her story has echoes of when Sarah Ferguson joined the family back in the Eighties.Fergie was a jolly, fun, self-deprecating young woman who thought she would have the ride of a letime. But she found herself profoundly restricted by her mother-in-law’s budget and her husband’s dullness. Instead of making a dignied exit, she had her toes sucked by another man because le was not as much fun as it had promised to be. It was ugly.The prospect of joining the Royal Family would fill me with horror — and it did so even way back in , when I was pictured alongside HRH Prince Edward at the theatre.I had become good friends with his best friend, James Baker.One night I joined James, Edward and another of his friends to go to the theatre.By sheer coincidence I was “papped” next to the prince.Excited and furious speculation ensued the following day about the mystery Swedish blonde — I was  and not yet on the ladder of fame — and I was quickly dubbed his latest flame. One newspaper even ran the headline “The Prince And The Showgirl” with old photos of me in school drama productions.It was my first experience of such widespread exposure and it came as an absolute shock.HRH was kind enough to phone me to offer his support and urge me to “say nothing”, which I duly did.After some months, the two of us did have a few dates, and while I, a most common commoner, would never have been considered “royal material”, le in The Firm crossed my mind on a few occasions.And it did not especially fill me with joy.I got the strong impression Prince Edward himself would have given anything to get in a car and drive away from it all, which was hardly the greatest endorsement. But despite getting a lot of flak over preceding years for dropping out of the Marines and then pursuing a career in the arts, the prospect of him walking away would never have been one he would have seriously entertained.His sense of duty, loyalty and obligation was too great.I really got a good insight into the restrictive le he led, along with his lack of access to any kind of normality.All the while he was surrounded by rules and traditions, and then there are the courtiers and staff, there to stle and control your many moves, constantly keeping your behaviour in check.I would go to dinner and bring my own bottle of white wine because budget and taste would have dictated a ghastly bottle of Liebfraumilch or some other type of sweet white wine, and thus a less fun evening.Because despite the Royal Family being an international brand, it seemed at the time, at least, that “taste” as such had somehow eluded Prince Edward.He was stuck with whatever the butler would bring and I am guessing money spent on wine was not considered money well spent.The foodwas decidedly plain and a tad dull.Everything in his apartment was so staid and old-fashioned.Nothing had been redecorated for decades and the bathroom had a very quaint old toilet.In my naivety, I had foolishly thought the royals would have the absolute latest in fashion and interiors, but it was like stepping back in time.Perhaps this was how Meghan experienced things, too, but with thoughts and attitudes. I would swear and push the boundaries because I felt it might amuse and maybe inspire more than a touch of reality and authenticity.But the thought of a loon like me being shackled to his le was enough to make me want to run for the hills — regardless of the universal fame that might have been waiting.The idea of a woman as fiercely independent as Meghan being defined and tethered by such an exclusive, traditional club seems, with hindsight, utterly impossible.Her initial sense of goodwill and charitable ambition appears to have been overtaken by her refusal to accept any opinion or critique.I am afraid I know to great personal cost that the limelight can be blinding.But it is a deal you make with yourself and, in her case, it was a deal she made with the British public — to serve.It is not asshe has given it her best shot for seven years and can no longer hack it.This self-defeating move away reeks of impatience, petulance and bitterness.Put simply, her new le became burdensome and an inconvenience when she discovered she could not run her own show.Her father, like mine — who opened his doors to the media when I was photographed next to Prince Edward — became a thorn in her side and she had no tools with which to deal with him.He became an embarrassment a mistake and a mess she could easily have dealt with but felt it more important to proceed with her new le and leave him behind. And then there is Harry: A man smitten and obsessed, a man who has been waiting for a Meghan all his le, someone to nurture him.He has sacriced everything for his we, willingly.He has given up all that he has ever known and everyone he holds dear to chance it all thousands of miles away, isolating himself in pursuit of a le that is not only unclear but precarious.There is no doubt that the Royal Family needs reduction and considerable reform to reflect modern times.But the thought that a newcomer might consider herself best positioned to be that subversive influence would be laughableit was not so hurtful and insulting to much of this country that has been so supportive of this historical institution. The noises from Team Sussex have been distracting, persistent and problematic because the le of a royal is, I am afraid, to toe the line.There is no halfway house, no part-time royalty — the job is not part of the gig economy.By trying to carve out a more contented, niche le for themselves, the Sussexes have made survival considerably more complicated with absolute exposure guaranteed and a letime’s guarantee of judgment and critique.I cannot be the only one who feels painfully disappointed and cheated, beguiled by Hollywood stardust and  promises.And now we are left wondering what the whole shebang was all about, becauseHarry and Meghan thought exiting was challenging, when this all ends in tears — as I fear it will — coming back to the fold will be utterly inconceivable.I DO believe that Meghan married Harry with good intentions and had every belief she could make a positive contribution to the Royal Family.I can also see how Harry, a vulnerable young man who lost his beloved mother at such an early age, could fall in love with a strong, independent woman who could provide some direction.What I do not think Meghan was prepared for was the pressure of doing everything by the book and having to follow so many rules once she had entered into the so-called Firm.The former actress was the first senior royal to have come from a background where she had already established her own successful career.She is an ambitious and determined woman who is not afraid to speak her mind and wants to do things her own way.Meghan is certainly assertive. She is determined in the face of adversity but is also vulnerable and perhaps not as tough as she likes to make out.It is also clear that she became deeply unhappy with royal le and her inability to retain her independence.During all that turmoil, Meghan was not able to publicly speak out about her feelings, so would send subtle messages.She would express how she felt through her jewellery, such as the butterfly earrings she wore shortly after her pregnancy was announced, which symbolised lightness against tension and the sense of hope and endurance.She was also seen wearing a Hamsa ring, used to ward off evil, while in the Canadian embassy. It was the day before the bombshell announcement that they were moving abroad.She often handled her pregnancy bump, wanting consciously or otherwise to draw attention to her developing baby and what it represented moving forward — her new future and family.There is no doubt in my mind that as much as Meghan adores Harry, she had a clear focus in mind from the moment they began to have feelings for each other. There were no coy hints or suggestions from her, as there were with Kate.Nor was she prepared to play the waiting game, hanging on in there until Harry was ready to propose.From the white “boyfriend shirt” she wore right at the beginning of their relationship to the way she looked at Harry and touched him, even in public, Meghan did not shy away from being loud and proud about where she wanted things to head.I think this behaviour stems from a stubborn insecurity that will not go away, and Meghan is not good with situations that are out of her control.Perhaps her coping mechanisms are not as strong as she thought. Maybe she is so determined her family will not suffer like she has in the past that she has become super-protective and frustrated at times.Meghan has had to battle a fair amount of adversity in her le, even before she met Harry.This includes a dficult, and now estranged, relationship with her father and half-sibling, with whom she no longer speaks.I do wonder why she seems to be cut off from her close childhood friends. And why do some of Harry’s oldest pals feel they have been discarded as a result of his relationship with Meghan She is a strong influence on Harry, undoubtedly.Meghan would probably admit that she is strong-willed, not always able to make the sacrices or compromises which are necessary to accept criticism or interference from the Royal Family.Perhaps there is a touch of the narcissist about her, putting her own feelings ahead of the dutul le she signed up to.For example, she seems to find it dficult to understand what her father has been going through or see his perspective.Also, when she told the ITV documentary crew, “It’s not enough to just survive something”, before adding, “You have to thrive”, that shows how important her own happiness and wellbeing is to her.But many strong and influential people have that narcissistic streak. They find it hard to tolerate a situation that makes them feel distressed or to manage a situation over which they have little control.What is interesting is that, following the move to North America, Meghan and Harry have effectively swapped roles.Instead of Meghan being the royal princess at Harry’s side, he will now be more at her behest, having to adapt to a totally dferent sort of le, and one that he could never have imagined.He might feel some resentment in due course, or he may adapt like a duck to water.Will their marriage last They have a tough journey ahead, but I hope so and I wish them well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have provided diagnosis kits to Hong Kong and Macau free of charge.The health minister also revealed Beijing is sharing information with other nations after the US, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Australia, France all confirmed cases.Chinese president Xi Jinping described the situation as grave on Saturday.On the same day Canada declared a first presumptive confirmed case in a resident who had ed from Wuhan.Health officials in Orange County, Calornia, reported that a third case of the virus had been registered in the US in a traveller from Wuhan, who was in isolation and in good condition.The Lunar New Year holiday, traditionally celebrated by millions of Chinese travelling around the country and abroad to see family, began on Friday but has been severely disrupted by the outbreak.Mr Xiaowei said China would intensy its containment efforts which have so far included transportation and travel curbs and the cancellation of big events.No fatalities have been reported outside China.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

camp","story":"During the Holocaust over a million people – the vast majority of them Jews – lost their lives.Auschwitz concentration camp was constructed in the suburbs of the Polish city Oświęcim, near the modern nations southern border, in .The site was already the location of  dilapidated buildings, which had previously housed soldiers and workers.After annexing that region of Poland during the early stages of World War Two, by April  the Nazi regime needed somewhere to house to Polish political prisoners, with local jails full.The majority of local residents were evicted to make way for German citizens, and Jewish workers from Oświęcim were forced to lay the foundations of the camp.A month after plans were approved, the first prisoners arrived at the initial camp, Auschwitz I, and within a year over , people were imprisoned there.When it was complete, it held around , inmates in appallingly cramped conditions, with numbers sometimes rising above ,.Above the gates, like other Nazi death camps, was the famous motto Arbeit macht frei – Work brings freedom.In October , with the German war in the east wreaking terrible loss of le, construction began for a second larger camp, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, in the village of Brzezinka three kilometres way.On the original plans for the huge facility, SS architect Karl Bischoff set the capacity for each cramped barracks at  – this figure was crossed out by hand, and replaced with .It was in Birkenau, which held , prisoners by , that the first gas chamber was made operational in March .This was later followed by several others, where the majority of Auschwitz prisoners were murdered on an industrial scale as the Holocaust plunged horrying depths.In October  a third camp, Auschwitz III, began housing prisoners at Monowitz around seven kilometres from the original site.There were also over  sub-camps in the surrounding areas, creating a vast, heavily-guarded complex enclosed by barbed wire fences and patrolled by thousands of SS troops.The camp was liberated on January , , by the rapidly advancing Soviet troops – the date is now commemorated each year as Holocaust Memorial Day.In , the th anniversary of the liberation is being remembered in the UK and around the world.The Soviet Army liberated the remaining , prisoners from the camps.The sheer scale of mass murder involved in the Holocaust means its impossible to calculate a precise figure.In total, an estimated . million people were sent to Auschwitz – and at least . million of these died.Around  per cent of the dead were Jewish, representing approximately a sixth of all Jews killed in the Holocaust.The rest of the inmates were comprised of Polish and Soviet prisoners, thousands of Romany people and an unknown number imprisoned for being homosexual.When the mass killings were at their peak, up to , Jews were being gassed per day, with the cyanide-based pesticide Zyklon B the weapon of choice.Those not killed in the gas chambers perished from starvation, forced labour and the infectious diseases that spread unchecked through the camps.The quality of le at Auschwitz was appalling – a true hell on earth.When they werent being worked to death, inmates were crammed together in unhygienic, inhumane conditions, and lived with the constant threat of punishment or torture at the hands of the SS guards.Furthermore, prisoners were subjected to degrading, often fatal medical experiments at the hands of twisted doctors such as the notorious Josef Mengele.With the Nazis rapidly losing ground against the Soviet Red Army in the latter stages of the war, Auschwitz was evacuated and much of it demolished.At the start of  the remaining prisoners were forced westwards into a death march, with many thousands perishing in the harsh winter conditions.Since June , Auschwitz I and II have been open as poignant museums devoted to the memories of those who lost their lives in the camps.Over a million people visit every year, with the exhibitions housed in many of the camps original buildings.Auschwitz has been a protected Unesco World Cultural Heritage site since , and admission to the grounds of the memorial is free of

Increasing murmurings on Westminster’s Tory benches about drt and lack of direction betray a creeping nervousness in party ranks – only a month after winning a thumping Parliamentary majority. Friday’s orchestrated celebrations of a Brexit not yet done and Britain remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union during ’s dangerous £billion trade talks will distract momentarily from the growing unease but prove no permanent ersion. Wiser Tory heads worry that Johnson thinks Downing Street is a grander version of London’s City Hall, where as Mayor he spent his time posing for photographs and squandering public money on vanity buses and an unbuilt garden bridge, stealing other people’s credit for the London  Olympics. Older Tory heads compare – unfavourably – Johnson’s early weeks, including a fortnight’s holiday in Mustique, to the Labour bundle of energy that was Tony Blair here, there and everywhere on his  debut. Early impressions count. HS, Huawei, climate emergencies and Whitehall upheaval are splitting a party incapable of remaining united outside election time. Include a slouching economy, an ailing NHS given a plaster instead of the required transfusion and another round of school cuts... and the bleak picture that emerges is nothing like the pretty fiction Johnson painted in December.  Add a dash of resentment over posh weirdo misfit adviser Dominic Cummings’ Mafioso act and the mix is political Kryptonite. This Clark Kent with thinning hair isn’t the character he sold to the electorate. Folk in seats such as Sedgefield, Stoke, Redcar, Grimsby and West Brom are entitled to feel short-changed.

Norah Connelly and  Stephanie Bonner were strangers when their sons Jonathan and Rhys died within days of each other in Glasgow last year, but theyaposve joined forces to put pressure on the police. The devastated women believe their boys could have met violent ends but are frustrated the police have never declared their deaths as murders. They fear the cases have been pushed down the pecking order and could be eventually forgotten, reports the Daily Record. “Our sons’ killers are out there and people know who and why. Don’t let something like this happen to you. Help us get justice for our boys, said Norah and Stephanie in a joint statement. Nineteen-year-old Rhysapos body was found half naked on August  after disappeared from the Balanark area of Glasgow on July . The Celtic fan had told his mum he going to to watch a football match with his dad but he never turned up. Family and friends launched a social media campaign to find the teenager before he was found in marsh land near the village of Gartloch. While Jonathan, a twin with learning dficulties, had been missing a week when his body was found in the water at Spiers Wharf on July . The -year-old had injuries to his head and body, and had gone missing after going into the town centre to speak to his employers about why his wages had not been paid.  The two mums both believe the initial missing persons reports were not taken seriously by police and think vital evidence may have been lost. Family members instead carried out their own investigations in a desperate bid to try and get some answers. “I just need to know what happened to my boy, said mum-of-five Stephanie. He was . I have no doubt my son was murdered. I need answers. We all miss him so much.” Norah, who has two daughters, said: “Whoever put Johnny in that canal did it to make it look like a suicide. My son would never have left me alone. Le is empty for us all now. I know Johnny was assaulted before he died. I will never give up searching for answers.” She waited two days after he disappeared before contacting police and said from that moment on she felt asher le has been destroyed.  Stephanie said: “I knew as only a mother would that something terrible had happened to Rhys. I put it on Facebook askinganyone had seen him. I heard he was seen with an older woman and we told the police this but they did nothing so me and my sister went to her house and she denied even knowing Rhys. “It took the police two weeks to search where his body was found and, even months later, I’m still not sure of the exact location but he was found half-naked, with his clothes about  yards away. “His baseball cap was discovered in a common stair and had been washed. The shorts he was wearing that day have never been found. “They didn’t have any forensics out they just put him in a van and took him away. They said they wouldn’t get any forensics due to theof time. It took them seven weeks to formally identy him.” Stephanie said her own probed uncovered CCTV of her tragic son with a woman but she said police took days to check the footage despite her pleas.  She said: “During those seven weeks, I still kept praying it wasn’t him but I knew deep down. I knew my boy was gone. I have prayed for justice, for answers. This has broken my family. It has consumed my le. I promised Rhys when he was lying in his coffin I would get answers for him and I would get justice. It’s all I can do for my son. We’re all shattered.” “Rhys was a cheeky but loveable teenager with his whole le ahead. His disappearance and death should have been taken more seriously. I feel let down by the police. Nobody from Police Scotland has been helping me. I’ve been forced to seek the answers myself. “It’s soul destroying. I can’t let this happen to anyone . My boy, our boys, deserve more. I beg anyone who may have information to speak to the police or call in anonymously. “Someone must know what happened to my son. His brothers and sisters miss him – we all do.” Norah said she is clinging to the hope an appeal by police for witnesses will unlock vital information in the hunt for her Johnny’s attackers. “It’s taken all this time for police to put out an appeal. When Johnny went missing and his body was found, my ex-husband made a video retracing his steps, she continued.  “They had Johnny on CCTV walking until he got to the underpass at Spiers Wharf. Johnny had learning dficulties and no sense of danger. If someone spoke to him, he’d chat back not realisinghe was in danger. “It breaks my heart to think my boy would be alive todayhe’d been paid his wages when he should have been. He wouldn’t have gone into town, he’d have stayed local and met up with his friends. “The police don’t know how he ended up in the water but whoever attacked him did it to make it look like suicide. We still don’t know how Johnny died. He’d been in the water too long.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Duchess of Cambridge has captured the inner strength of Holocaust survivors in photographs to mark the th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps.   She has made it her mission to help break the cycle of damaged children becoming damaged adults in Britain but in this new photographic project Kate encountered grandparents who had endured the most horric of childhood traumas and come through incredible adversity to live fulfilled lives. Inspired by the story of Anne Frank and the pictures of th century Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer, the future Queen, one of several photographers involved in the project, took portraits of two survivors with their children and grandchildren and described them as “two of the most le-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet”.   Each of the portraits, which will be published on Monday to mark Holocaust Memorial Day, depicts the special connection between a survivor and younger relatives carrying their legacy. They are designed to encourage everyone in Britain to perpetuate and share the memory of the horrors inflicted by the Nazis. One of Kate’s portraits was of -year-old Steven Frank, originally from Amsterdam, who survived multiple concentration camps as a child. He is pictured alongside his granddaughters Maggie and Trixie Fleet, aged  and .  Her other portrait is of -year-old Yvonne Bernstein, originally from Germany, who was a hidden child in France throughout most of the Holocaust. She is pictured with her -year-old granddaughter Chloe Wright. Kate, , who is patron of the Royal Photographic Society and a keen amateur snapper, said: The harrowing atrocities of the Holocaust, which were caused by the most unthinkable evil, will forever lay heavy in our hearts. Yet it is so often through the most unimaginable adversity that the most remarkable people flourish. Despite unbelievable trauma at the start of their lives, Yvonne Bernstein and Steven Frank are two of the most le-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet. They look back on their experiences with sadness, but also with gratitude that they were some of the lucky few to make it through. Their stories will stay with me forever. Whilst I have been lucky enough to meet two of the now very few survivors, I recognise not everyone in the future will be able to hear these stories first hand. It is vital that their memories are preserved and passed on to future generations, so that what they went through will never be forgotten.  One of the most moving accounts I read as a young girl was The Diary of Anne Frank, which tells a very personal reflection of le under Nazi occupation from a childaposs perspective. Her sensitive and intimate interpretation of the horrors of the time was one of the underlying inspirations behind the images. I wanted to make the portraits deeply personal to Yvonne and Steven - a celebration of family and the le that they have built since they both arrived in Britain in the s. The families brought items of personal signicance with them which are included in the photographs. It was a true honour to have been asked to participate in this project and I hope in some way Yvonne and Stevenaposs memories will be kept alive as they pass the baton to the next generation. The Duchess, a history of art graduate, said her photographic style in these portraits was inspired by Vermeer, whose domestic interior scenes of middle class le display a signature pearly light and draw the eye into the picture using carefully placed objects. Her photo of Yvonne features her German ID card, dated March , , which has a letter ‘J’ for Jew stamped on it. There is also a treasured brooch, bought for Yvonne by her daughter. It was made by the jewellery firm founded by her great-grandfather before it was taken over by the Nazis. Steven and his granddaughters included particularly poignant items in his portrait by Kate. They included a pan which his mother kept with them to cook extra morsels of food throughout their time in the camps, and a tomato from his garden. When Steven was in the Theresienstadt camp as a child, he helped another prisoner grow tomatoes. “He had picked out the pips from rotten tomatoes and grew his own. I became his little helper, watering these tomatoes,” Steven said. “He showed me how to pick out the side shoots so they grow straight, then when he was sent off to a camp in Poland, he asked me to look after his plants. “I was so proud to be asked - I was only eight years old. Since the war I have grown tomatoes at home in the greenhouse and every time I water them I think of this man. I don’t even know his name. I still feel  years on that I’m watering his tomato plants for him. When the tomatoes are out now the grandchildren come over and help to pick them.” The portraits will be part of a new exhibition which will open later this year, bringing together  powerful images of survivors and their family members to mark  years since the end of the Holocaust.  Two other portraits, by distinguished photographers Jillian Edelstein and Frederic Aranda, are released today to announce the project - a collaboration between the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, Jewish News, and the Royal Photographic Society. Other images featuring in the exhibition will be taken by fellows of the Royal Photographic Society. In a photograph by Frederic Aranda, Joan Salter, , who fled the Nazis as a young child, appears with her husband Martin and her daughter Shelley. John Hajdu, , who survived the Budapest Ghetto, is in a portrait with his four-year-old grandson Zac photographed by Jillian Edelstein.

The -year-old had gone to a pub to have a drink with friends but, after just  minutes, she felt a sudden pain between her shoulder blades and then her whole body became numb.I thought I was going to die, I just didnapost know what was happening to me, Sarah told Grimsby Live.“I was halfway through my drink when I felt a sudden pain between my shoulder blades. It went all the way to the top of my arms and I couldn’t feel them, my whole body went numb. My hands wouldnapost move. She was dashed to hospital after her speech became slurred at Rose and Crown in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, in June last year. Sarah added: “My legs began to shake uncontrollably, my speech was slurred and my vision became blurred. It was  minutes from start to finish and I was paralysed from the chest down and unable to speak properly. “I didn’t have a clue what was going on, to be honest, I thought I was dying. Eventually, I found out I had a clot in my neck and some in my brain as well. “After the stroke, my friends and family came over to the pub immediately and waited for the ambulance with me.  Sarah, of Grimsby, spent six months undergoing rehabilitation and has just ed home where she is trying to come to terms with her new le. Carpets have had to be removed so she can move her wheelchair, and the living room has been taken over by a specialist bed and equipment. Itaposs nice to be home, but I canapost do anything in my own home, Sarah continued. I have carers five times a day and district nurses visit me in the morning to take care of personal needs. We are having to sell our home, I have had to sell my horse that I have only had for three years. I waited  years to have the money to have my own horse. I’d dreamed of doing cross country with her, but now that’ll never happen.  “However, my family did bring her to see me at the hospital which was a lovely surprise. I have had to say goodbye to my old le, which is still really hard to come to terms with. “Mentally, it’s been really hard. I’m just struggling to come to terms with what has happened still. Now, I can only really move my shoulders, people don’t know what it’s like. The cause of the stroke remains a mystery.It has also led Sarah to suffer high blood pressure and other complications. Sarah and her partner Dean have set up a GoFundMe page to help raise funds for the modications to a new vehicle to give her a bit of independence. “The charity Motability will pay for the upkeep of the vehicle, but we have to pay £, up front to mody the vehicle so it’s wheelchair accessible, she explained. “I recently tried going out with some friends in my wheelchair. Getting there was fine, but I couldn’t access a wheelchair taxi on the way home and ended up having to be manually lted into the back of a Land Rover, which just wasn’t good at all”. Dean said: “There are grants available for this kind of thing, but because I’m working, Sarah doesn’t meet the criteria to be eligible for it. That’s why we started the fundraiser, to try and raise the money to get Sarah what she needs. The appeal was set up to raise half of the money they needed and has already smashed that target.

A new plane was then dispatched from Luton Airport in the UK to collect Charles from Muscat so a fresh crew could take him to the Queenaposs estate in Sandringham for royal crisis talks.There, he met with the Queen and Princes William and Harry to discuss the bid by his son and Meghan Markle to quit royal le and move to Canada.The Queenaposs helicopter was then dispatched from Hampshire to collect him from Sandringham. The chopper took him back to Scotland, it then carried on back to its base in Hampshire without the Prince. He then took a -mile journey by private jet from Scotland to Davos.  Later that same day he took another flight tallying up a further , air miles as he headed to Israel, where world leaders are getting set to mark the th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau tomorrow. The future King, who has campaigned for decades on environmental issues, was pictured alongside Greta Thunberg after he gave a speech to the forum in Davos, Switzerland urging environmental action. A Clarence House spokesman told the Mail on Sunday: Global travel is an inescapable part of the Prince’s role as a senior member of the Royal Family representing the UK overseas.  When he travels he does so at the request of the British Government. He does not choose the destinations any more than he chooses the means by which the journeys are undertaken.’ Muna Suleiman, of Friends Of The Earth, told the newspaper: Climate targets can’t be met without cutting pollution from aviation emissions, and private jets are a particularly wasteful way to travel.

Sources close to the Royal Family say Prince Charles and Prince William have been reaching out to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to say they couldto the UK full-time,they wanted to, without having to resume their official royal duties. Courtiers fear the pressure on Vancouver Island, where the Sussexes are staying, will have a major impact on the couple, The Sunday Times reports. “The palace are very worried about the Sussexes, because they are vulnerable outside the embrace of the family,” a source said. “They are making contingency plans in case the Sussexes suddenly turn round and say: ‘Can we come back under your wing ’”The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have issued a warning over harassment by photographers, who, they say, are permanently camped outside their Vancouver Island home. They said there have been attempts to photograph the Sussexes inside their home using long range lenses. Meghan was photographed while out walking with the coupleaposs infant son, Archie, and her two dogs. Lawyers for the couple claim the photos were taken without her consent and that the photographer was hiding in the bushes and spying on her. This comes after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex decided to step back from their senior roles within the Royal Family. Under the terms of the deal agreed by Harry and Meghan, the Sussexes will keep Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate as their British home, but will repay the £.m used to renovate the property.  Royal officials believe that might be a place to protect the couple from media scrutiny. “You could bring them back to Frogmore to look after them. They wouldn’tto royal duties, but they could have a period of rehabilitation and recuperation,” a source said. Other locations where the couple could be brought are Sandringham and the Prince of Walesaposs house in Wales “This is a looking ahead thing. There’s no timeline here. But everybody agrees that this is a fragile couple. Nobody is going to say, no they can’t come back, the source added.

Joe Black, , had previously tried to take his le twice and expressed suicidal thoughts to his GP following an acrimonious break up with his girlfriend so his doctor sent him to the unit for specialist treatment. However psychiatric experts said inpatient admission was not required and that he should work on self care. Just three days later customer care representative Joe was found hanged at his his home in Macclesfield, Cheshire, by two worried work colleagues who went to his flat after he failed to turn in for his sht. At an inquest in the town, Mr Blackaposs mother Clare condemned staff at Macclesfield District Hospital over their assessment of him claiming they turned away her son when he was a broken man. She said: Heaposs a young man seeking help from his GP. He is referred to AE but then told to go back to his GP. Thereaposs a breakdown here and it just feels like itaposs Friday night, no beds and less paperwork. He was a broken man asking for help. What am I going to tell my other two children  Wait a minute you havenapost ticked the right boxes  He came to you and you turned him away. The hearing was told Mr Black had been head boy at school and loved football which he played for  years and was very gted at maths which he later went onto study for a year at Sheffield University. But his mental health deteriorated during a three year relationship with his unnamed girlfriend. He dropped out of university and the relationship broke down at the end of July last year leaving Mr Black isolated after having cut himself off from friends.  In the weeks before his death on August  he had been trying to get on with his le and make a fresh start even joining the gym the day of his death. But he struggled to cope with the rumours that he had beaten his ex-girlfriend and her leaving the flat they shared together. Mrs Black told the hearing: His relationship with his girlfriend broke down and she moved out about a fortnight before Joes death. His studies didnapost work out and there where relationship dficulties and he decided to leave university at the end of first year. His relationship had been something of an up and down one over the years. That was a dficult separation and it hit Joe hard. At the time of his death she still had some of her belongings in the flat something continued to way heavily on Joes mind. Joe always wanted to do what he could to please her and was burning the candle at both ends. Joeaposs relationship started around  and he fell madly in love but think this was the time when his mental health began to deteriorate. His behaviour became challenging between him finishing his A levels and then starting his degree.  After he left college became argumentative some of these arguments arose discussions about needing to maintain a balance between his relationship and looking out for future prospects. I was aware he was on and off anti depressants that would cause his mood to go up and down. Triggers for his moods included abandonment and isolation. There were previous incidents of self harm on two occasions and he thought about ending his le. In June  he took an overdose at university and December , had attempted to drown himself in the bath. After Christmas he seemed to be okay but looking back that was just Joe putting on a brave front. He seemed upbeat and talking aslooking to make a fresh start but there had been an allegation that Joe caused some bruising to her face but Joe didnapost accept that. He had been banned from two nightclubs as she was now with the manager of these establishments. That upset Joe because he felt ashe couldnapost go out in Macclesfield. I think he did what he could to try motivate himself and be positive but sadly wasnapost able to do so.  Days before his death he had told his mother that he did want to get back together with his ex-girlfriend and didnapost want to be without her, but that was thought to be a blip in his behaviour. A statement from Health Assured, a wellbeing company which helped Joe said: On August , it was claimed Joe was suicidal. He said he had no friends and family around and his girlfriend had just walked out on him. He claimed she had made things up, she was trying to self harm and he was trying to stop her. She bit him and he pushed her but she stated he abused her. He has a lack of self confidence and feeling overwhelmed. Joe said he had waves of depression and had these for around six years. Holly Nettle, a registered psychiatric nurse at Macclesfield district general hospital said: Joe had seen his GP and was coming to AE as he was being flagged as someone with suicidal thoughts.

Some called for the NBC news anchor to be sacked after a clip of the broadcast quickly went viral as the world reacted in shock to the death of the basketball great along with his daughter Gianna and seven others. In the clip the reporter appears begins to say what some claimed was aposLos Angeles n*****s,apos then quickly corrects herself, saying aposLos Angeles Lakers.apos The former New Yorker has denied using the racial slur as she apologised for the slip tonight. Alison Morris wrote that she had gone to say Knicks instead of Lakers by mistake, then corrected herself mid-word, saying aposNakers.apos Footage of her on-air stumble was recorded and posted online by swathes of furious viewers, with many demanding that MSNBC fire her and apologise. She wrote on Twitter: Earlier today, while reporting on the tragic news of Kobe Bryant’s passing, I unfortunately stuttered on air, combining the names of the Knicks and the Lakers to say aposNakers.apos  Please know I did not  would NEVER use a racist term. I apologize for the confusion this caused.    Viewers were fiercely ided over whether the anchor had said the aposnapos word or had become tongue-tied and stumbled over the word. Viewers were quick to defend her, pointing out her New York career roots and saying it was possible she had been about to call the aposLakersapos the aposKnicksapos, and had stumbled over the word as she realised her mistake. Footage of the broadcast began going viral shortly after the tragic news of Bryantaposs death, along with his young daughter and seven other people, in a helicopter crash emerged today. All nine aboard the chopper were killed in the tragic incident earlier today in Calabasas, an upscale neighbourhood near Los Angeles. Twitter users swtly accused the reporter of racism and urged the broadcaster to sack her, saying it was too offensive to be regarded as just a slip of the tongue. However not everyone was convinced she said the aposnapos word as Morris quickly became the target of a social media pile-on. Some suggested it was possible she had become tongue-tied during the live segment and said aposnakersapos instead of aposLakers.apos Twitter user @BaeAreaNiko wrote: How do you confuse Lakers with n****s  This is disgusting man....

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThrough the mist of yet ­another freezing dawn rising on the ­desolate, now silent, death camp of Auschwitz, Eva Schloss thought she saw a bear appear on the horizon. The emaciated -year-old girl could have easily been hallucinating, driven mad by starvation and relentless terror. It was eight months since the Austrian teenager had first arrived in this hell, and days since she and her mother awoke to find their filthy hut almost empty. The Nazis had fled from Soviet troops, taking prisoners with them on death marches that would kill most, to hide evidence of their crimes. They left behind only those souls on the brink of death. Eva and Elfriede should have gone with them, and surely perished. Their exhaustion meant they overslept and got left behind, awaking to “dead silence”.The bear was in fact a scout arriving ahead of the advancing Soviets who,  days later, would free Auschwitz and those clinging to le there. The -year-old, one of the few who was in Auschwitz for its liberation  years ago today, recalls this first moment of hope with a dazzling, lipsticked smile. She says: “We saw a huge creature in fur with icicles hanging from him, who, before it was daylight, looked like a bear. “When it came closer it turned out it was a Russian scout in a big Russian hat. He couldn’t speak our language. The Russians didn’t know about the camps, the gassing, that we were Jewish. But he looked at us, and knew we were victims.” Soberly, she reflects on the fact the fates of she and her playmate, the diarist Anne Frank, just one month younger, could so easily have swapped. Anne and her older sister Margot, who posthumously, became her famous step-sisters when her widowed mother married their widower father, Otto, were instead marched to Bergen-Bn where they died before British troops could free them three months later. “If Anne and Margot had not gone on that march, they’d have survived,” she insists, quietly. “We overslept, and that saved our le. Our positions could have changed easily.” Eva’s family and the Franks met in Amsterdam, where both fled to escape persecution. The girls would play on the street.  Eva remembers the day “chatterbox” Anne showed off the diary Otto had given her for her th birthday. “I remember her being so happy,” she smiles. “She liked writing so much, she loved telling stories.” Soon afterwards, the Franks went into hiding, and so did Eva’s family, who were eventually betrayed, and transported in May, . The Franks were discovered in September. Both families ended up in Auschwitz, but didn’t meet. Eva’s last memory of Anne is of the bubbly girl brandishing the diary which would, published by her father after the war, make her world-famous. Eva survived selection for the gas chambers because her mother gave her a wide-brimmed hat to hide her youth. “That was the first miracle,” she says. Every detail of Auschwitz remains crystal clear. “The filth, the dirt, no toilets. If they caught you sitting on a bucket you would be beaten. The indignity,” she recalls, sitting in her incongruously cosy North London flat. “The lice. We became covered in scabs and boils. And the starvation,” she says. “The cup of liquid in the morning, the chunk of bread at night.” Eva describes the growing sense of chaos in December . “We realised the Nazis were nervous,” she says. “A lot of the guards ran away.”  One night they announced they’d be leaving on a march, and Birkenau, the women’s sub-camp, was to be burned. It wasn’t, and they were left behind. “The camp was deserted, no dogs barking. There was dead silence,” Eva explains. There were around  ­prisoners left in Birkenau, she believes, and the same in the men’s camp. Eva remembers no other children. The only food was dregs. “There was a small pond and we hacked the ice to get water,” says Eva. Deaths were daily. The memory that terrorised Eva for years was moving bodies. “We had to heap them up. I tried to close their eyelids, but they were frozen,” she says. When the Soviets arrived she was joyful because she longed for food. “It was too soon to feel any joy of survival,” she says. “They gave us metal bowls of cabbage soup with strong bacon fat. We ate, and ate, and ate.”  The eating after months of starvation led to tragedy. “In the morning there were dead people,” Eva says. In the men’s camp, she saw Otto Frank. “He looked terrible,” Eva recalls. “He was asking, ‘Have you seen my girls ’” Two weeks later, the Soviets started transporting them to Odessa, now in Ukraine. The troops gave them their unorms for warmth – Eva kept hers for years. And as the women gained weight, they provided bras, she giggles. “It made me feel human, like a woman again,” she says. One night, the soldiers struck up music. “They showed me how to dance,” she says. “I began to feel like myself again.” In , she was to be reunited with some of them in Russia. But it was to be many years before she found happiness. Learning her father and brother, Erich and Heinz, had died left her depressed, and she considered suicide.

A wildle photographer captured the exact moment that a mother elephant left faeces on its babyaposs head. The photographer watched the series of events unfold in the Mana Pools National Park in Zimbabwe. But whataposs not initially obvious is the fact thereaposs more to this action than meets the eye - and according to officials, the act actually helps the younger giants develop a strong immune system. Jens Cullman, a photographer, said: What I’ve heard is that when the baby get dung on it, it helps boost the baby’s immune system and maybe it’s some kind of bonding with the mother as well. I got photos of the calf looking towards me and then it gets up and the mum turns around and the calf follows her and then she drops her dung on him. The photos were exciting for me, I have to admit. Friends and family I’ve shown them to think they’re hilarious. Everyone was just ‘wow wow wow’.  So, in what seems like a very counterproductive move, poo actually helps the baby elephantaposs immune system. Photographer Jens added that these photos have a far more serious aspect to them than the dung incident. He said the mother elephant was skinny because of a bad dry season in the park, a lot of elephants and other animals having reportedly died or suffered. Jens said: In Mana Pools this year it was very dry and a lot of animals suffered.The mother was a very skinny elephant as well. A lot of elephants and baby elephants died because of the drought. Jens added that he had to stop the car to snap a photo when she saw the adorable baby elephant.

Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the GLI-F cannister, which is described a ‘weapon of war’ in field manuals would no longer be issued to law and order officials. Mr Castaner on Sunday told France  television that too many demonstrators had been seriously injured. This is the reason I think we have to remove the GLI-F,’ said Mr Castaner, who said this would happen immediately. There have been continual disturbances on the streets of major French cities including Paris for more than a year as thousands protest against Emmanuel Macron’s government. The latest demonstrations are against pension reforms, but the Yellow Vest movement has also been consistently on the streets since November . Named after their distinctive fluorescent motoring jackets, the Vests started out protesting against rising fuel prices but now want a reform of the entire Fth Republic. Many of the Vests have been hit by the GLI-F, which is made up of teargas and an explosive charge of  grams of TNT. Riot squad officers frequently fire hundreds of rounds of the grenades on to crowds, in an attempt to control them. Up until now, France has been the only European country to deploy the GLI-F, which cause a deafening blast and can easily maim those hit. In February last year, a protester picked up one of the grenades outside the National Assembly, France’s Parliament in Paris, and lost four fingers. A man also had his hand torn off by one of the grenades in Bordeaux in December .  In May , the OF F – another type of grenade which was frequently used by French police – was banned after it was linked to the death of botanist Rémi Fraisse. Mr Fraise, who was also an environmental campaign, died at the age of  after one of the stun grenades was fired at him by police during a protest against the building of a dam near Toulouse. In November, a -year-old police brigadier received a two months suspended prison sentence for throwing part of a broken paving stone at Yellow Vest protesters in Paris.  In the first full-blown prosecution against the forces of law and order held in relation to the movement, the officer was solely identied only as officer A. Other Yellow Vests have lost their eyes after being hit by rubber aposdefensive bulletsapos.

We know it is one of highest causes of mortality but we don’t have a lot of data beyond that. In many cases the diabetes remains undiagnosed because it is not a well-known disease there.“We are committed to working in this field to bring new insights to present to policy makers and this partnership with the University of Dundee will help with that.#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/camila-cabello-PA.jpg ","title":"biffy clyro calvin harris and harry styles to headline radio 1s big weekend in dundee","story":"Dundee has been confirmed as the location for Radio #s Big Weekend, with Scots rockers Bfy Clyro and DJ Calvin Harris among the headline acts.Six main artists were named this morning live on Radio , with AJ Tracey, Camila Cabello, Dua Lipa, and Harry Styles also coming to the event, which will be held at Camperdown Park on May -.It had previously been rumoured that the event would be ing to the City of Discovery after the success of the weekend in Dundee in .Other acts appearing at the event are due to be announced in the run-up to the festival.\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed t-QBtHYiQU featureoembed#enablejsapi#originhttps:wpcluster.dctdigital\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreenBfy Clyro’s Simon Neil said: “We are delighted to be appearing at Radio ’s Big Weekend in Dundee.

When Liam Smith found Harkes at the edge of the box to fire in a fairly innocuous shot, however, the mood seemed to lt around Tannadice.On  minutes, Siegrist again halted a deflected Kamberi effort from a matter of yards as the Hibees continued to press. United were starting to enjoy more possession, though, and went in at half-time with the tie level thanks to Shankland#s th domestic goal of the season.In the last of three minutes of added time at the end of the first period, Harkes strolled through the heart of the Hibs defence before sliding in Shankland to slot home from eight yards despite being under heavy pressure.United weren#t level for long, though, as two minutes into the second period the men from Edinburgh were back in the lead.Scott Allan played provider as he laid in Boyle to drive home low beyond an outstretched Siegrist from fully  yards.Kamberi#s battle with Siegrist continued on  minutes with the goalie again denying the striker#s thunderbolt from distance with the rebound just evading Boyle on the follow-up.Allan fired over just after the hour as the Terrors, again, fell out of the game as boss Robbie Neilson ordered their first change of the afternoon, sending Appere on for Pawlett.And young attacker Appere had the desired impact  minutes after coming on, picking up possession on the left before twisting and turning away from Steven Whittaker and then David Gray to curl a delightful effort beyond the helpless Ofir Marciano for -.Both teams pushed for a winner in the closing  minutes, with Siegrist pulling off a top save from Doidge in injury time, but it never came, meaning these two will have to do it all again a week on Tuesday in the capital.Dundee United : Siegrist , Smith, Watson, Connolly, Robson Harkes , Butcher , Powers McMullan, Shankland, Pawlett .Subs not used: Deniz, Sporle, Reynolds, Sow and King.Hibs : Marciano , Naismith , Porteous , Hanlon , Stevenson Hallberg, Allan, Whittaker Boyle, Doidge, Kamberi.Subs: Bogdan , Slivka, Newell, Horgan and Shaw.Ref: Kevin Clancy.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/05/5cd5913d19ccd5.34421230-846x564.jpg ","title":"five north of tay cup finals but just one success for goalie ally","story":"Tele columnist John Brown has previously #blethered# about Ally Martin, a well-decorated junior player in the Dundee area. John spoke of how Ally#s first wage for playing football was a packet of sweets. Then he told us about Ally#s schoolboy days, and how he played with and against some stars of the future in his teenage years. In this, the third piece about the former keeper, Ally explains how he reached five North of Tay Cup Finals # but only found success in one#Ally Martin’s form on the park started to attract the attention of higher-grade teams.He said: “After two seasons with the Broughty YM U s, I signed for Carnoustie Panmure Junior FC and this, unfortunately, coincided with my leaving school and starting an apprenticeship as a quantity surveyor.“Besides a one-day-a-week attendance at Bell Street Technical College , I had night classes four evenings a week.“This did not bode well in getting to know my junior team colleagues as I was unable to train with them, except on the odd occasion.“However, during my one season with The Gowfers, I was fortunate to be invited to play for Arbroath reserves and had a week’s training at Dens Park with Dundee FC.”One of his early senior stints threw up a quirky tale.He explained: “On the bus going through to Stenhousemuir for a reserve game, some of the senior players asked me how good my goal-kicking was as Stenhousemuir had a reputation of using something akin to a medicine ball for games.“I was confident in that respect and was looking forward to playing with a new ball, a prerequisite of all games under the SFA – as I understood it.“A white ball was carried out by the referee and, after my first goal-kick, I realised the players were correct. It was some weight.“Later in the second half, the rain came on and that revealed we were not playing with a new ball but one whitewashed before the game.”Ally recalls John Prentice as the Arbroath manager and he travelled with the team.He continued: “I did not sign for Carnoustie for the following season and resumed my football with Broughty United in the senior team.“YM Anchorage held sway within the Midlands AFA during the s, s and s, winning the League Championship on  occasions.“NCR then dominated the s, winning the League Championship  seasons in a row and, in , they won the Scottish Amateur Cup.“They are the only Midlands AFA team to lt that trophy.“From season -, Broughty reached the final of the North of Tay Cup on three consecutive seasons, losing out on each occasion to NCR, Ballinluig and NCR respectively.“In the - competition, we defeated Ballinluig in the semi-final after  hours  minutes play .

competitions, winning is what matters.“On our way to winning the league, the club lost just one game and went  games without defeat.“Not only that,  of those games were played in the seven weeks of evening games at the end of the season.“In the s, the club won the Championship on a further three occasions and the Bremner Cup twice.“The club reached the final of the North of Tay Cup once more in

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"valuable support offered to argyll businesses","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowScotland#s entrepreneurial spirit is booming in the face of economic and political challenges, with over , private sector businesses currently operating in the country – the highest level since  – . per cent of which are Small and Medium-sized Enterprises .As Scotland#s national business advice service, Business Gateway helps thousands of customers to meet their business goals every year.

ScotWind Leasing will present Scotland as an attractive destination for the signicant investment needed to deliver the scale of offshore wind projects we want to see.’Employment was on the agenda at Campbeltown Community Council’s meeting last week.Chairman Alan Baker said: ‘We discussed the unemployment in the area due to ious redundancies that were issued, namely at Campbeltown Creamery and CS Wind.‘It was felt that after the initial meeting at the MACC premises that nothing further has been forthcoming.‘There is also to be a meeting in March with Fergus Ewing MSP to discuss further action.’The Courier asked both Mr Ewing’s office and the press office at the Scottish Government but no one could confirm the meeting was taking place, or when, by the time we went to press."},{"url":null,"title":"valuable support offered to argyll businesses","story":"As Scotland#s national business advice service, Business Gateway helps thousands of customers to meet their business goals every year.

Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum.

She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

Wetherspoon pubs limit parents to two alcoholic drinks eachthey have children with them.The rule came to light after a picture was taken of a poster in a pub in Kent.The poster, which has since been taken down, read: \"As part of our licensing it is our responsibility to ensure that we are protecting children from harm.\"Therefore adults in charge of children will be allowed to have one alcoholic drink and a further alcoholic drink with a sit-down meal.\"It has been a crime since  to be drunk in charge of a child under the age of seven in a public place.The offence can be punished by a fine or up to a month in jail.A spokesman for Wetherspoon,which has a pub on Musselburghs Bridge Street, The David Macbeth Moir,said: \"The manager took the decision to put the poster in the pub to emphasise to customers that she would not allow parents to drink while their children were running round uncontrolled in the pub.\"The notice had a positive effect, with mostly good feedback.\"Wetherspoonadded: \"There is a guideline, though not a policy, that we will serve the adult a maximum of two alcoholic drinks with their meal.\"The reason is that we dont want children being unruly in the pubs and

Or seeing your chosen football team for the day defending your stake as though their lives depended on it.On these occasions, any losses are the affordable cost, happily borne, of momentarily living le a little more jaggy.Most of us who have ever placed a wager know the odds of sustained success are stacked against us from the outset but itrsquos a deal wersquove struck with our eyes open. We have been fortunate that any wrong turning wersquove made in our lives any adversity, hasnrsquot yet left us prey to addiction.Digital technology increases in sophistication with each passing year. Those who can harness it quickly discover that it can be turned into sharp profit without meddlesome factors like human labour, factory costs and a care for the environment. This has transformed the act of placing a bet on a sporting outcome.:Brian Rice case highlight how approach to gambling in Scottish football has to be revisitedPreviously, the issues associated with addiction and problem gambling were unintended and unsought. Irsquom not saying here you could ever have characterised this industry by its empathy for the flawed human condition. Once, there had been a degree of humanity though, where checks and balances might be provided simply by visiting a bookmakers and interacting with friends and neighbours.Now, billions are spent by the online gambling industry to ensure that addiction isnrsquot an unfortunate consequence but a desired outcome. And professional football, the most popular sport in the world, is where the lowest-hanging fruit is to be found.This week, Brian Rice, the respected manager of Hamilton Academical FC, became the latest high-profile football person to admit that he has been struggling with gambling addiction for most of his adult le.His story is only the latest in a long litany of human tragedies associated with football and gambling.Almost immediately the football tribe ndash managers, players and journalists ndash threw a protective cordon around him and praised Mr Rice for his dignity and courage in going public with his ordeal. Predictably, they strove to absolve the football authorities and our major clubs from any blame that might have attached to them owing to their lucrative association with online gambling.Some of their arguments were reasonable.After all, much of the sponsorship cash can be spent on developing young players and supporting nearby health and wellbeing initiatives in local communities.This though, is a bit like saying thatyou swim with sharks it can give you a greaterappreciation of their natural environment.  There is a reason why the predatory giants of the online gambling industry have targeted professional football. In no other sphere of human endeavour do so many working-class people gather in such huge numbers at regular intervals.According to recently reported research the industry is using third-party companies to collect personal data and thus enable online casinos to target low-income customers and ex-gamblers. One former digital marketing specialist in the industry said: ldquoThird-party data providers allowed us to target their email lists with precision. Lower-income users were among the most successfully targeted segments.The eye-watering profits accruing from gambling allow operators to use every artice and lever at their disposal to ensure they are ring-fenced. In the House of Commons several MPs recently sought to defend fixed-odds betting machines , the so-called ldquocrack cocaine of gambling in the face of Government proposals to limit them. These politicians were later revealed to have received expensive gts and hospitality from the betting industry.:Neil Cameron: Brian Rice case nothing to do with hypocrisySo vast and pernicious is the influence of the gambling lobby that in , the former Sports Minister, Tracey Crouch, was forced to admit defeat. She resigned after the government refused to back down on the timetable for reducing the maximum stake on FOBMs. She had wanted the change to be made earlier than the planned date of October . Yet senior colleagues ignored her even when she said that the delay could lead to hundreds of people killing themselves because of gambling addiction linked to these machines.Ms Crouch wasnrsquot indulging in emotional hyperbole here. In , research published in the journal Neuron, found that gambling makes people susceptible to depression and anxiety by altering the brainrsquos physical structure. Previous research had consistently found links associating gambling with debt, family breakdown and a suite of mental health issues.The new research though, found thatthese affective disorders diminish the capacity to tolerate economic risk.The online behemoths prey on menwhen they are at their most vulnerable. This is when they are watching live football and drinking.Their smartphone devices are weaponised by the online companies to extract as much money as possible from them in the two-hour window available to them.Odds are offered on every twist and turn of the action by a bewildering array of online products that bookend the televised pictures and analysis. The Gambling Commission recently fined a major online firm poundm after it missed more than  incidents indicating behaviour associated with a problem gambler. On one occasion the gambler immediately re-staked substantial winnings, suggesting this was either a money-laundering operation or an affluent addict. Yet this occurs much more often further down the financial scale but escapes scrutiny owing to the smaller sums.The football authorities which solicit these firms and the clubs who prostitute themselves to them are just as culpable in spreading the disease of gambling addiction. They are knowingly giving licence to these companies to destroy the lives of their most vulnerable and disadvantaged supporters.My own team, Celtic, have won more trophies than I could ever have hoped for during my letime. Yet I would gladly trade all of them to redeem the le of one person and their family ruined by addiction to gambling. And I would beseech Celtic and all other clubs who permit their colours to be contaminated by the logos of these online jackals to be rid of them and to work harder to attract more ethical and less-lethal sponsorship."},{"url":null,"title":"lgbt-groups-pen-open-letter-support-gra-reforms-trans-rights","story":"Dozens of LGBT groups across the country have today written to MSPs about ldquoattempts ... to isolate the trans community from the wider LGBT community.It comes amid the highly-polarised debate on the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposals for reforming the Gender Recognition Act , which would allow transgender people to self-declare their gender.The reforms have come under fire from womenrsquos rights groups and others who claim predators could use them to enter womenrsquos spaces by pretending to be female.Transgender Scots say they have been targets of hate crime more often than before the debate started, particularly on social media, with many now afraid to speak out.Today,  groups have signed an open letter in support of the GRA reforms, which reads: ldquoWe are resolute and united in support of trans equality and human rights ... and today reaffirm our support for trans people and equality.

We really do have a major problem here.\"If you look where I live at St Cyrus, we have got rocks on the beach that used to be  foot high, they have disappeared now.\"Either you spend poundm now, or spend poundm in five or less years time, or you put Montrose underwater ndash take your pick.\"A Scottish Government managing flood risk team briefing from two years ago, seen by The Herald, highlighted the need for action over sand dune erosion that \"affect the golf course and the town in Montrose\".At that point it was estimated that between  and  metres of beach had been lost to the sea since the early s and that the Montrose coastline could wear away by up to  metres over the next  years.The experts believed the coastline has been retreating since the s and has been disappearing at a rate of two metres a year.While some had favoured a poundm coastal hard rock armour defence to be put in place quickly, the team suggested that this would just transfer the problem where.At that point, the government had made available funding of pound million per year for  years to enable local authorities to invest in flood protection works.\"The problem is that we are hitting the bottom of the dunes, it is simply eroding the dunes,\" said Mr Adams. \"It is getting serious now ndash becauseit breaches there it could go into Montrose, on the wrong tide and the wrong wind.\"A solution is being sought with discussions being held involving the Scottish Government, Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Angus Council.\"We want the money pulled forward, we just need a solution for Montrose,\" said Mr Adams. \"It has to be substantial ndash you are talking millions.\"A  overview of the threat.Discussions about improving sea defences in Montrose have been going on for more than two years, but new surveys have been carried out because of concerns that the rate of erosion has increased with the two -hole links courses under threat.In  it was thought that a poundm cash injection from the Scottish Government would reinforce the beach and allow the dunes to recharge.\"Rock armour isnt the answer,\" said Mr Adams. \"Rock armour will work, but visibly it is awful. You are talking three miles. And at poundm every  metres it is bloody expensive.\"We have to find a solution and it has to be something that is sustainable.\"The other way to do it ndash a more sightly way ndash is to produce an island, which would be two or three kilometres long, slightly offshore. It will do something Annat Bank was doing, but in a dferent position.\"I believe that is what we need to aim for. It would last between  and  years. The material the MPA dredge out of the bay can be put on to it, in specic positions.\"It would be an engineered product, an engineered island offshore.\"The waves hit that further offshore, dissipate that, and you dont get that wave motion hitting the sand dunes at Montrose, and we need to get beach recharge as well.\"Prof Jim Hansom, the principal researcher of the Dynamic Coast project, who is finishing off an updated examination of the erosion threat to Scotlands coasts, said \"beach nourishment\" had to be a feature of any efforts to protect Montrose.: Open season. How Kelly Holmes has been part of a mental health podcast revolution.\"The bottom line is that the most effective defence against coastal erosion is a nice, big healthy beach that reconfigures its geometry depending on wave conditions,\" said Prof Hanson. \"So when the wave conditions are low, the beach is nice and flat and when wave energy is high the beach configures itself so that it is much steeper and more absorptive of wave energy.\"Unfortunately when we experience coastal erosion, we reach for engineers, and put a concrete seawall in its place. And a concrete sea wall is often exactly the wrong thing you need to be doing in those sorts of situations.\"A sea wall is going to be too expensive in Montrose and it is probably not going to be very effective on the beach. You want to keep the beach as a recreational asset, and you dont want to change its character, because it is a spectacular beach for all sorts of reasons.\"One view on the disappearing golf course.In , a UK climate change report warned rising seas and coastal erosion had left Montrose Golf Links ldquowith nowhere to go.And in the same year, Angus Council revealed Montrose Bay had been chosen as a ldquosuper site for research into the environmental problem.Montrose Port Authority has been accused of contributing to the erosion when it dredges in the area to keep the entrance to the towns harbour clear and then dumps the material in Lunan Bay a few miles to the south.Critics say this practice is \"wasting\" dredged material that could helped protect the dunes, and links director Chris Curnin has previously saidthe material was put on to Montrose beach in the ldquocorrect position it would have a ldquosignicant impact and slow down the erosion.However, the authority has long denied these claims, and an assessment it carried out in  said that episodic weather events ndash in particular wave direction and height ndash were linked to the greatest rates of coastal erosion in the area, which took place during the early s.This period also coincided with the production of a lower volume of dredged navigational channel material.It then insisted it must be able to continue dumping dredged material around Lunan Baythe port is to remain operational."},{"url":null,"title":"dont-rule-wildcat-scottish-independence-referendum---mhairi-black","story":"Mhairi Black made the comments in the Sunday Times as the First Minister gets set to lay out the next steps towards a fresh ballot.:The UK will neverto the European Union says David MartinThe SNP leadership has consistently stressed it does not support an unofficial independence vote and Ms Black has become the most senior figure to give some authority to the idea.An unofficial referendum would be open to a legal challenge.She told the newspaper: ldquoThere could be mileage in a consultative referendum because the Scottish question is complicated.ldquoThe current United Kingdom government position is weak and unsustainable, andthe last five years proves anything, it proves that what happens at Westminster is unpredictable.:Tom Gordon: Nicola Sturgeonrsquos lsquonext stepsrsquo put her judgment on the lineThe MP forPaisley and Renfrewshire South added her preference would be to do the next referendum ldquoby the book and that an official referendum would ensure international recognition.She accepted a vote \"would then no doubt be challenged in the UK Supreme Court and the Supreme Court would have to make a decision.\"Black also said that she would support a referendum on whether Scotland should retain the monarch saying: Personally Im not a monarchist, Ive always been a republican and I would like to think there is a majority of Scots who take that view.

So things are speeding up.\"But he accepted their past erosion predictions were based on past rates, and do not include future sea level change.While an updated analysis is expected in the summer, Prof Hansom warned of the need for urgent action.\"The key thing is you hear a lot of things about climate change and reducing carbon emissions to tackle temperature increases and that is not going to help us for another  years,\" said Prof Hansom, an honorary research fellow at the University of Glasgows School of Geographical and Earth Sciences.\"We have got an adaptational problem now that needs to be addressed, before any of these carbon emission stabilisations or reductions actually produce any effect.\"He believed work is urgently required to reinforce Scotlands eroding coastline through articial extensions of the nations beaches to protect them from the ever-encroaching sea.:Race to save Scotlands greatest golf courses from the seaHe said Holland was leading the way in spending millions of pounds a year in using sand and sediment extracted offshore and deposited to replenish beaches and help shore the coastline up, but Scotland and the UK is lagging behind.\"There is an immediate problem that needs to be addressed now. Think about what is going to happen to your coastline before temperature stabilises,\" he said.\"You have to think seriously about what happens at Edinburgh seafront, what happens across the Glasgow seafront, not to mention the hundreds of wee towns along the coast like Arbroath and Stonehaven and Stornoway.\"When you think where our sewage sites are they are close to sea level, where our railways and roads that hug the coast, they are going to be jeopardised, many are going to be under threat in  or  years time. Before we begin to stabilise carbon emissions and control the temperature, we have got these sea level rises happening now, \" added Prof Hansom, who also said it does not make sense to develop areas that are close to sea level.A new MCCIP report fed into by more than  scientists warns that the latest UK sea-level rise projections is \"higher than previous estimates, implying increased coastal-flood risk\".\"The likelihood of compound effects from tidal flooding and extreme rainfall is increasing, which can greatly exacerbate flood impacts,\" it said.Montrose has been cited as anexample of the threat of climate change to the future of links golf in Scotland.Aseparate analysis on the impact of climate change on coasts but with a focus on transport and infrastructure says that it is estimated the average erosion rates around the Scottish coastline have doubled since the s to . metre per year.: New flood warnings as Orkney predicted to have highest water levels for  yearsNearly , miles of UK transport infrastructure is considered to be at risk of flooding.The report says there are \"several vulnerable stretches\" of railway track including the Ayrshire Coast Line.The  Dynamic Coast project used information drawn from more than , maps and a million data points and was carried out by experts from the Scottish government, Scottish Natural Heritage and the University of Glasgow.It was then discovered that the erosion of the coastline had doubled in speed over the previous  years.Two weeks ago there were warnings of extensivecoastalflooding acrossScotland- as Storm Brendan battered the country.The ScottishEnvironmentProtection Agencysaid that on Orkney on Tuesday at Stromness, Stronsay, Scapa, Sanday, Westray, St Margarets Hope, Longhope and Hoy, Burray and Ayre of Cara, water levels were predicted to be the highest in the last  yearsIt warned that any properties that hadbeen affected by coastal flooding in the past were likely to be at risk."},{"url":null,"title":"keir-starmer-calls-radical-redistribution-power-wealth-opportunity-within-new-constitutional-settlement","story":"The Shadow Brexit Secretary, who will travel to Scotland this week, was forced to cancel events when his mother-in-law was admitted to hospital following an accident.He will kick-off a week of campaigning across the UK with a speech in east London this evening arguing for a federal system in which power and resources are devolved.Sir Keir, a frontrunner in the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn, will call for the end of the status quo and say power, wealth and opportunity should be put back into the hands of the people.He said: \"The status quo is not working.

My motto, for the sake of my grandchildren is \"better safe than sorry\".Rose Harvie, Dumbarton.IN focusing on the possible costs of carbon reduction actions Charles Wardrop, conveniently forgets another economic measure, the opportunity costs of not reducing these emissions.The distress and financial costs to Australian friends through the intense bush fires give just one cameo of the total likely to be incurred by the whole worldDonald Trump and Dr Wardrop succeed in persuading us not to bother cutting emissions. There is a technique in economics called discounting, which tries to compare costs incurred today with benefits which only accrue years later. This technique reduces the value of future benefits by a proportion for each year that elapses before they are achieved. The proportion is called the discount rate, and the higher it is, the lower a value is placed on benefits accruing in the future compared to their current cost. The value of the discount rate is related to current financial interest rates, so given the negligibleon investments at the moment with a bank rate below half of one percent, one would now expect the discount rate to be similarly low, and future benefits to be highly valued. Dr Wardrop and his ilk clearly do not recognise this, and would set a mental discount rate close to  per cent, totally devaluing future benefits.The last straw for any reasonable humanitarian is his suggestion that, because Scotlands emissions are only a small proportion of the global total, nothing need be done. So at what percentage of the total does it become morally necessary to take action  In Dr Wardrop and Mr Trumps world, there is no level at which emissions cannot be considered to be trivial. Future generations are likely to judge matters in a very dferent way.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.IN an era of gloomy prophecies, the absurd Doomsday Clock claims to count down the seconds to a looming global apocalypse. But even the most scientically challenged must suspect it is conflating disparate threats with ying degrees of urgency: nuclear war, climate change, and emerging technologies.The stated motivation of those involved in this absurdity is to apply pressure to governments by calling on citizens ldquoto express themselves in all the ways available to them. But we already have the endless rants of the Swedish prophetess Greta Thunberg and most of us could do with just the tiniest break.Rev Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.THE fiscal lunacy of spending pound billion on foreign aid is worth exposing. First, we dont actually have pound billion to give away.

That is two thousand billion pounds. The annual interest on that sum is around poundbn a week: poundbn a year.So our poundbn of largesse to countries who either dont need it, or who dont like us, would pay the interest on our National Debt for fourteen weeks.Sooner or later,we carry on living beyond our means, we are likely to be in the clutches of the IMF. One more Labour government would do it, but the money wasted on becoming carbon neutral will certainly do itwe dont wake up to the fact that climate change is a plot to collapse the western financial system.And evenwe were to continue with this daft scheme, we need only to look at the plight of Australia to find a deserving recipient for poundbn.Malcolm Parkin, Kinross."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-nasty-brutal-brazen-undercover-scottish-fox-hunt","story":"Fortunately, there is someone here who can put a stop to it: an investigator whorsquos been watching the whole thing from behind a line of trees. He steps out into the open and speaks to one of the men whorsquos supposed to be controlling the dogs. Suddenly, the atmosphere changes. The hunters call out to the pack and blow their horns and get the hounds under control. The fox has escaped. This time.The investigator, who works for the League Against Cruel Sports, has seen it all before. He has been working on investigations into animal cruelty for  years and Irsquove been out a few times with him on his undercover work. It is tough going. One time, we had to be up at .am. We wear green and brown to blend into the countryside and prevent us being seen. Itrsquos often cold, wet, and miserable. And it leaves me angry and appalled that the law on hunting with dogs is being broken in Scotland so openly, so brutally, and so brazenly.I canrsquot tell you the name of the investigator for obvious reasons ndash he has been threatened with violence and his work would be compromisedthe men and women who hunt foxes knew who he was. But I can tell you what hersquos seen. He has seen many, many foxes running for their lives, like that vixen near Jedburgh. He has seen foxes being disembowelled alive. Hersquos seen a gang of men dig down into a den for an hour just for the privilege of letting their dogs tear a fox apart.:Time to really ban fox hunting in Scotland, for goodAll of it is against the law. In , the Protection of Wild MammalsAct banned the hunting of foxes with dogs, apart from an exemption for the purposes of pest control: according to the law, hunters can still use dogs to flush foxes out of cover so they can be shot. What this means is that, as soon as a fox breaks cover, the dogs should be called back. Either the fox is shot at that point or it gets away. The dogs cannot continue to chase it andthey do, it is a breach of the law.But letrsquos compare that to the hunt in the Borders, shall we  There are several men around, one on a quadbike, several on horseback none of them appear to be carrying guns, which you would expect to seethey were obeying the law. We see the fox break cover and about five minutes later we see the hounds following the scent. We do not hear anyone attempting to control the dogs or anyone calling them back, until the investigator steps forward.What the hunters say in response is that the public is being misled by anti-hunters. When I asked them about the incident in the Borders, the Jed Forest Hunt said there were guns present. Their spokesman at the Scottish Countryside Alliance also told me they were operating a legal pest control service in compliance with the  Act, whereas the League Against Cruel Sports was using the deceitful practice of hiding in bushes and heavily edited footage to suggest illegal practices. The public are being deceived, said the spokesman.However, Irsquove seen the unedited footage. I have been out with the investigator on other investigations and I know what my common sense is telling me: the law on hunting is being broken in Scotland, regularly, openly and blatantly. As for the men and women who do it, the investigator says this of them: ldquoThey are setting a pack of dogs on to wild animals itrsquos like hare coursing. They may dress a little better and they may ride horses, but thatrsquos the only dference. When you see them out in the field, itrsquos savage.Whatrsquos galling for anyone who cares about putting a stop to fox hunting is that the response to the savagery has been spinelessness and a weak law thatrsquos failing to protect wild animals. The Bonomy Review into fox hunting in  said quite clearly that there was evidence that flushing foxes from cover was being used as a decoy for the continuation of traditional hunting practices, and last year the Scottish Government said it would put a stop to it and would bring forward a bill to strengthen the legislation.:Campaigners lodge petition to stop bloodthirsty US hunter from ing to ScotlandBut nothing has happened. There has been no real support either, as far as I can see, for the Green MSP Alison Johnstonersquos private memberrsquos bill which would do what the Government says it wants to do. The Government could fast-track that bill. It hasnrsquot.So what we need ndash quickly, before many more foxes are killed by dogs ndash is a law that deals with the situation as it really is. Men and women are out there, in Scotland, in the open, two or three times a week, for months on end, hunting and killing foxes with dogs, which means the law needs to ban the use of dogs altogether. Such a ban would also help expose the huntersrsquo claims that their aim is to control foxes. This is not about control. This is a sport. Itrsquos a hobby ndash a savage, bloody and barbaric hobby.What the Government needs to say to these people is: you cannot pursue your grubby little hobby here and we will pass a law to make sure you canrsquot. In the meantime, we are relying on the anti-hunters, and the investigators, and anyone with compassion, to keep up the pressure. There is hope of change in Scotland. But all I can hear right now is the sound of the horns and the call of the hounds.

In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Hands-on...Superintendent Sharon Comriehas worked for the SSPCA for an incredible  years.

I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

Currently, it supports communities in northern Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria. Mark said: “Our focus is enabling people to rebuild their livelihoods.

That one struck me as odd but it turns out everyone loves honey!“Embrace the Middle East also supports intercommunal peace building. The charity is led by local partners and shows how changes, big and small, can make a dference.”While many Iraqi citizens have chosen not toto their homeland, Embrace is there to help those who do.Mark added: “Their homes and agricultural land have been damaged. Our focus is future-proofing their ability to stay in their communities.“We’re not an NGO which is there for a short-term fix – we are there for the long term.”As well as working for Embrace the Middle East three days a week, Mark is an honorary fellow at Aberdeen University and has also taught social sciences at Stirling and Durham Universities."},{"url":null,"title":"support for social enterprise","story":"Local social enterprise Wood RecyclAbility has received funding support from international firms in a bid to help their expansion plans.Wood RecyclAbility is looking to raise £, to expand and offer more opportunities for adults with learning disabilities.The social enterprise has been providingpractical work experience and training for people with additional support needs for  years and has prevented over , tons of waste wood from going to landfill.The social enterprise makes a range of products such as bird tables, planters and garden benches from the waste wood.The Ellon-based organisation has now received a £, funding boost from CNOOC International as they look to purchase equipment to ersy their work by recycling rigid plastic and mattresses.This comes after BP offered £, last month to support their work, along with a new contract secured with NHS Grampian to create  lockable boxes made from recycled wood.Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin welcomed the funding and said: “I know this money will make a real and tangible dference.”Operations manager Brian Reid said: “This is a fantastic start to our fundraising efforts, to enable us to recycle more rigid plastics and embark on mattress recycling.“As a social enterprise we really appreciate the generosity given to us both in terms of time and funding from CNOOC International.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

I was surrounded by a phenomenal group of kind and supportive people from all walks of le who had me laughing through every mental and physical challenge the wall had to give us. The views are so breath-taking no photo can do it justice, the challenge pushed me past my limits and rewarded me in ways I never expected.“I learned so much about the Chinese culture and had the adventure of a letime. I made the most amazing memories and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone , I will cherish every moment for the rest of my le and feel privileged to have been had this experience and to have raised funds and awareness for CLAN at the same time.”CLAN head of income generation and business development Fiona Fernie commented: “We are so grateful to everyone who undertakes challenges to raise money for CLAN.“We never underestimate how hard people work to raise money for CLAN and it is rewarding to hear when our supporters have had really positive experiences doing so. CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"ScotRail has launched a new campaign encouraging people to stop and think about their own personal safety while travelling or at work.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

When he first came to this country, in , his English was almost non-existent. He made many mistakes. On one occasion he put a letter in a bin bearing the legend LITTER. But he was a hard worker and a quick learner. And by the mid-s, he could hold his own at Scrabble. One of my memories of him involves him freaking out because he had forgotten the Italian word for grapefruit. It’s “pompelmo” – one of the few words I do remember from back then, along with “zanzari”and “fiammeri” .I wasn’t brought up bilingual. My dad worked long hours and I spent most of my time with my Scottish mum. Instead, I was sent to Saturday morning Italian classes, which I hated because most of the other children there spoke it at home. Now and again, my dad would decree the dinner table an Italian-only zone. Those nights I ate in sullen silence.Then, when I was , my dad died, and so, though I later went on to sit my Higher, I never became fluent enough to keep up with the noisy, free-flowing conversation that is integral to Italian family le.With hindsight, this feels like a pity. Being able to speak more than one language is a gt. It widens your horizons and makes you more employable Also, language and culture are intimately connected. A country’s language shapes its ideas as surely as it expresses them. It is fundamental to its identity and its sense of humour. When you do not share a language, it is dficult to share jokes. And the ability to share jokes is at the heart of human relationships.My lack of fluency was in part responsible for my eventual detachment from my Italian heritage. If your language skills are patchyyou are unable to grasp sub-text and innuendo and nuance, then, however hard you try to belong, you will always be on the outside looking in.I have been thinking about all this since I read about the Comhairle Nan Eilean Siarplan to increase bilingualism. From next year pupils starting primary will be taught in Gaelic, switching to English only in Primary , by which point speaking Gaelic ought to be second nature to them.The idea is inspired. Around , of the Western Isles’ population speak the language and more than half of parents already opt into Gaelic Medium Education . However, by making GME the default setting, with an opt-out for parents who are opposed, the local authority is positioning bilingualism as the norm.Anyone who has witnessed their primary school child being taught French as part of the Scottish government’s + policy will understand the limitations of trying to shoe-horn a foreign language into an overcrowded curriculum. GME overcomes those limitations. And it’s an approach that is increasingly popular where. The number of children enrolled in Canada’s French immersion schools rose by a fth between  to  as aspirational parents realised the educational benefits.In this context, Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith’s intervention last week looks out of touch. She called the Western Isles’ move “deeply troubling” and suggested being taught in Gaelic could put pupils at a disadvantage. But there is no evidence for this. As human cognitive neuroscientist Dr Thomas Bak pointed out in a letter to The Scotsman such a view is based on the assumption that – as there is only a limited space in our brain – adding something new means taking something  away.“It assumes all pieces of knowledge that we learn are unconnected,” he wrote. “This is not the case. Every new piece of information we get is integrated with already existing knowledge and in this way can strengthen rather than weaken what we know already.”Studies show bilingual children outstrip their monoglot counterparts in cognitive tests and these advantages extend into later le with bilingualism linked to the delayed onset of dementia and better recovery after a stroke.Encouraging more Gaelic speaking will also redress some of the damage done by the  Education Act and help reconnect the next generation with their own culture. This pernicious piece of legislation put an end to Gaelic medium schools and punished those who continued to use the language.Establishment contempt for the country’s minority languages continued into the second half of the th century with those who expressed themselves in anything other than standard English still belted as late as the s.Not surprisingly this evocative language started to die out. Between  and , the number of Gaelic speakers dropped from , to , .In the s, however, there was a sht in thinking. Politicians began to realise the potential for Gaelic to revive depopulated areas and stimulate economic growth. There was increased funding for Gaelic arts, television and education, with Gaelic medium schools opening in the central belt as well as in traditional Gaelic-speaking areas.Until recently, there was a cross-party consensus on its importance. In , a law to protect and promote Gaelic was passed by the then Labour administration at Holyrood.As with much , however, Gaelic was re-politicised by the indyref with ultra unionists perceiving it as a nationalist totem. So now, every attempt to bolster it is met with a backlash. How much ink has been wasted whining about the cost of Gaelic road signs  Though, Transport Scotland says only £, was spent between  and , and the Scottish government has only ever received two complaints.The same sentiments have been expressed over the addition of Scots on to the primary school curriculum, although reading a handful of poems is unlikely to turn pupils into SNP activists.It’s not unusual, of course, for minority languages to face opposition. Disagreements over the Irish Language Act – which should give the Irish language equal status in Northern Ireland – contributed to the collapse of Stormont. But such hostility is short-sighted. Moderate and culturally-minded unionists understand this. Last week, Donald Cameron, Tory MSP for the Highlands and Islands, tweeted his support for the Western Isles’ plan . Distancing himself from Smith, he said his party had been promoting Gaelic for  years.This was not the first time Cameron had spoken up. In , he appealed to ultra unionists to tone down their rhetoric on the language. Having studied it himself, he understands its value.What the Western Isles is trying to do is impressive. If it succeeds it will produce a generation of children as much at home with Gaelic as with English. As someone who missed out on bilingualism, I’m glad its pupils are being given a skill that will keep them in touch with their heritage. And I find it deeply troubling that anyone would seek to stand in their way.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"reimagined princes street gardens would host 15 major events a year under new business plan","story":"A business plan for the long-awaited Quaich Project would see the redeveloped park used as a catalyst to ldquoreimagine Princes Street and the west end of the city in the next few years.There will be no limit on the number of ticketed events which do not restrict wider access to the gardens in future. The cap only affects concerts and other major events which close off all or part of the park to non ticket-holders during normal opening hours.The business plan, which is due to be discussed by councillors next week, would effectively give the green light for major events like the Summer Sessions pop and rock concerts, the Fly Open Air dance music festival, the cityrsquos festival fireworks finale and the Hogmanay concert in the gardens to continue.The proposed limit on events which restrict public access to the gardens is three times the size of a previous official cap, which has been in place for years. It was effectively relaxed when the council decided to treat an extended series of concerts as one event.The business case also raises the prospect of new medium-sized events being staged in the gardens, such as the ldquoSummer Nights events held in Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow. It is thought there would also be flexibility to accommodate large-scale one-off events involving the likes of the BBC, MTV or the Tour de France.The overall vision for the project, which has been in the planning for five years, is to \"create and sustain a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.\"Income from all-ticket events would help subsidise the staging of smaller-scale events in the gardens, such as a Pride event, cinema screenings, showcases for buskers, school prom events and light shows.Other new events could include theatre productions, traditional arts and culture events, live music performances, spoken word events and family activities. Under the vision for the future of the park, which dates back to the mid-th century, ldquoevery Edinburgh citizen and visitor to the city will have experienced West Princes Street Gardens and the Quaich Project. Community groups would only pay a nominal fee, which could be as low as £, for the use of the gardens for their events under the new financial model, with the city council handling bookings from event organisers and promoters.It is hoped up to £, a year could be generated from the hiring out of the gardens for events and income from the new two-storey ldquogateway centre, although running costs for the new-look gardens are estimated to come to up to £, in future.The Quaich Project, a public private partnership being pursued by the city council and a trust set up by Apex Hotels founder and former Edinburgh Playhouse owner Norman Springford, would see the run-down Ross Bandstand, which opened in , replaced by a ldquoHobbit House-style pavilion for performances and an amphitheatre instead of the existing concrete bowl.A two-storey complex featuring a visitor centre, cafe and corporate hospitality facilities would offer direct access from Princes Street and boast spectacular views of events below Edinburgh Castle. The business plan has been published ahead of detailed designs for the revamp of the park being submitted to the council in the spring. A key aim is to deliver ldquoa balanced programme of activities ranging from small scale community events  learning programmes to festivals and major events throughout the year, befitting a capital city, world class visitor destination and much-loved public lsquogarden.rsquoIt states: ldquoWe will curate the use of spaces and activities throughout West Princes Street Gardens to enable a primary focus on community events which reflect the nature of the spaces involved.\"These include school and family events, lectures and talks, garden and nature tours, traditional art and culture, live music and theatre, heritage and historical programmes. The new facility will be offered at low cost for community groups and schools.ldquoWe will also procure and programme a specic number of major events which will provide high profile and high-income streams to create the affordability to community groups.ldquoWe will promote and market the project to a wide range of community bodies, schools and colleges, event and festival organisers to ensure that a healthy balance exists to enable an active yet tranquil and accessible space across the year.It is hoped that the impact of the Quaich Project will help the west end of the city withstand the impact of the new St James development, which is due to open later this year. Work is also due to be finished within months on a new Johnnie Walker visitor centre in the former House of Fraser department store, while there are plans to turn the former Royal Overseas league building opposite the bandstand into a hotel.The blueprint states: ldquoSitting in the heart of Scotlandrsquos capital, the Quaich Project offers a unique  for promoting a wide iety of activity in a spectacular setting, underpinned by a core aim of providing a mix of events and activities that fulfil our mission.ldquoIt also offers a catalyst for the re-imagining of Princes Street and its environs. With the opening of the new St James Centre and the refocusing of retail activity to the eastern end of the city centre, the project has the potential to drive the context of the area ndash cultural, social, wellbeing and environmental themes dominating a space currently occupied by buses and shops.In his report for next weekrsquos culture committee, place director Paul Lawrence states: ldquoThe completion of the refurbishment and development of West Princes Street Gardens in general, and the redevelopment of the Ross Pavilion and the construction of the associated gateway building in particular, is to the benefit of residents, visitors, event organisers and festivals, and Edinburghrsquos reputation.Donald Wilson, the city councilrsquos culture chief, said: ldquoThis is a very important stage in the project to reimagine West Princes Street Gardens.ldquoThe core focus for the business model is on community access and activity by creating and sustaining a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.ldquoThis is a model where big events that involve exclusive access to the gardens are kept to a minimum, but these will make it possible to offer low cost rental of spaces to community or charitable organisations. Crucially, it proposes no more event days than we have at present.ldquoWest Princes Street Gardens are open almost every day of the year, with early closure for events, mainly in the evenings, amounting to less than % of normal opening times. It is estimated that within the new operating model this would continue.ldquoThe proposed new access route behind the pavilion is estimated to reduce event set up and takedown times by at least  per cent, thus reducing the impact on the gardens.David Ellis, managing director of the Quaich Project, said: ldquoOur vision is to improve the entirety of the gardens with a focus on making them a more enjoyable and accessible place for the benefit of Edinburgh residents and visitors all year round. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brian monteith it is my last week as an mep here is what i ll do","story":"By any standards this is a momentous week. No matter how you view Brexit, positively as theof large amounts of sovereignty to the UK, negatively as the abandonment of a progressive political project, or with sheer exasperation and boredom, leaving the European Union at  o#clock this Friday evening is an historical event.For me it also marks my last week as a Brexit Party member of the European Parliament, a week when I and my colleagues have to decide whether or not to give our backing to the government’s Withdrawal Agreement. For, despite the signatures of the EU Commission and UK Prime Minister, or that the Withdrawal Bill finally achieved parliamentary approval and received royal assent to become an Act – the European Parliament still has to give it its blessing, otherwise we shall leave the EU but without the transition arrangementsin place.Moreover, it also will mark what Nigel Farage has called the mothballing of the Brexit Party, our stepping back from political campaigning and the proffering of candidates in elections due in the coming months, such as mayoral contests and ious local council contests.All of these events are, of course, interlinked. The Prime Minister won a handsome majority of  MPs in the general election, giving him the mandate and power to pass his version of Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement. It was offered to, and received, the approval of the British people. Whatever the criticisms my party have, and they are both serious and legion, we did not win a single MP in what was, after all, the Brexit general election. Getting Brexit done was undeniably high on people’s agenda, no matter the quality of the “deal”. Boris Johnson managed to achieve that victory in large part because the Brexit Party chose to stand down all of its  parliamentary candidates who were ready to fight Tories in the seats they had won in . Nigel Farage took that decision because he secured from the Prime Minister commitments that stretched the Withdrawal Agreement further, promises that did not require the EU’s consent and would not have transpired had we capitulated like four MEP defectors had demanded. The first was that whatever happens in the coming negotiations for a future relationship with the EUthe -month transition period would end on  December of this year – with no further extension, which until the PM’s oath was being viewed as highly likely. This commitment has since been put into the Act and is now the law. To resile from it would require parliamentary approval, which while possible would be hugely embarrassing and put the Prime Minister in breach of trust with the British people. Johnson went further. He assured Farage he would seek a Canada EU-style trade agreement with no political alignment. This promise is also, thus far, on track to being delivered. The Chancellor, Savid Javid, has talked about the importance of the UK being able to erge away from EU regulations, behaving like any other normal country not enmeshed in the EU’s nets of bureaucratic arrangements, political trade-offs and international entanglements. Of course any British company seeking to export to the EU, be it parts for a car’s gearbox or the whole automobile, will need to comply with the regulations it has in place – just as they would need to comply with the rules of China or the United Statesthey were exporting there. What is dferent is UK companies that are not exporting to the EU, or indeed not exporting at all, will no longer need to comply with the EU’s internal market rules as they do now. We shall be able to erge – and, be they hairdressers, restaurateurs or the vast majority of our businesseswill be freed from previous restrictionswe choose to abolish them.Welcome though these commitments were, they did not change the fact that in itself the Withdrawal Agreement stinks. It betrays the Union by creating a customs border for trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain down the Irish Sea.Despite the Prime Minister’s repeated denials there will be no bureaucratic obstacles, local manufacturers in Ulster are already pointing to problems with paperwork. It leaves our fishing communities at the mercy of the Common Fisheries Policy for a year, with the continued threat that denying open access to the EU will be used by its negotiators as a deal-breaker for a wider trade deal on goods and services. Then there is the continued commitment to hand over nearly £ billion of public funds for financial commitments that would not stand normal tests of any independent scrutiny or audit. Nevertheless, the commitments given to Nigel Farage by the Prime Minister now give the UK negotiating team far greater leverage to agree a good future relationship from the EU than at any time since Theresa May decided recklessly to allow Michel Barnier to set the sequencing of the negotiating agenda. This week my colleagues and I shall have to decidewe can hold our noses and ignore the stench of a bad transition agreement because of the Prime Minister’s commitments to procuring something better in the next stage – consideringthe evidence before suggests he is indeed sincere on these matters. Were Johnson to go back on his word and seek another extension or sign away our futures, be in no doubt Nigel Farage will be dusting down his suit for yet one more comeback tour.Brian Monteith MEP is chief whip of the Brexit Party in the European Parliament©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch here s why the tories have it so wrong on gaelic","story":"Liz Smith should be proud.

Liz Smith seems to take her job seriously and has always appeared well-briefed and relatively open to new ideas.So, does the Tory MSP just have a problem with Gaelic  If so, she must have missed the fact that Sgoil Ghàidhlig Ghlaschuregularly outperforms every other secondary in Glasgow, with half of sixth years achieving five or more Highers. Strange.Ms Smith has somehow also missed the fact that UK language studentslag behind only lawyers, medics and vets in employability. It also seems that even when language graduates are not employed to speak their primary language, the fact they’ve spoken two languages from a young age, makes it far easier to learn more. It’s this versatility, this aptitude for overcoming cultural barriers, this belief in the innate ability of humans to connect and this willingness to inhabit the mindset of other cultures that makes bi-lingual students so very valuable. But I suspect Liz Smith knows that. I’m also guessing Ms Smith agrees with Dr Thomas H. Bak, an expert in human cognitive neuroscienceat Edinburgh University, who observed in a letter to this paper: “There is a wealth of evidence suggesting bilingual children outperform monolingual ones on cognitive tests ... and these effects are not confined to childhood, [but] continue across the lespan leading to a slower cognitive ageing, delayed onset of dementia and better cognitive recovery after stroke. Remarkably, an improvement in attention has been documented in participants of all ages after a one-week intensive language course … in Gaelic.”I imagine she was also nodding at the views of Professor Wilson McLeod of Edinburgh University, who told a Sunday newspaper why no Mandarin or German-medium schools exist in Scotland“We have Gaelic medium education because parents fought like hell to get it. They organised, they mobilised, they petitioned, and lobbied councillors and just wouldn’t let go. There have been other programmes – there was one in Italian in Glasgow, one in French in Aberdeen. They have never really gone anywhere, there has never been a drive for it.”Quite. There’s a big drive to learn Gaelic at the moment – prompted in part by the young Gaels behind Scots Gaelic Duolingo. Perhaps Liz Smith hadn’t heard of this sassy new online learning package. I imagine she has now.Last year, this small group of Gaelic language activists successfully lobbied Duolingo – a free language learning  with more than  million users and  languages – to include Scots Gaelic. Now it has  thousand signed-up students – that’s twice as many as the official Gaelic-speaking total and includes , who joined in the wake of Liz Smith’s remarks, and a related newspaper article which attacked bi-lingual road-signs, the efficacy of Bòrd na Gàidhlig and the “sacred cow” status of the Gaelic language.Add in the patient, educational work of the Feisean movementthrough the medium of Gaelic since the s. Add in the inspirational influence of Gaelic-speaking musicians from Julie Fowlis and Karen Mathieson to Peat n Diesel and the director of Celtic Connections, Donald Shaw. Even folk who don’t speak Gaelic now know for sure they’re missing something. That wasn’t true even five years ago.Perhaps that’s why Liz Smith made a welcome about-turn this weekend when she tweeted an apology “to those members of the Gaelic community who have been offended. My concerns did not relate to the quality of GME teaching  learning, both of which have such a strong record”.Of course, that only raised more questions. If the standard of Gaelic Medium teaching isn’t the problem then what is  Many think it’s a straightforward belief that Gaelic’s a “loser language”. This kind of cultural cringe is certainly well-documented but also outdated and faintly embarrassing.As Argyll MSP and Brexit Minister Mike Russell tweeted last week “It’s very sad to see someone as intelligent as Liz Smith parroting such nonsense.” So, does the MSP for Mid Scotland and Fe really share the tired, old, knuckle-dragging aversion to Scotland’s precious, traditional cultures  I’ll stick my neck out and say I don’t think so. More likely she has been sucked into the dark side of Toryism by the need to fit in with new political masters swept to power south of the Border on a xenophobic, anti-foreigner  of pro-Brexit isolationism.Last February, a BBC report showed that the places most likely to have no French or German teaching in school were the biggest Leave areas in England. Maybe it’s a coincidence, but maybe it reflects a worrying pushback against the sound of languages other than English being spoken in Britain. Does that pushback now include the indigenous languages of Scotland  If so, it’s a massively dangerous development.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll majority of scots now back holyrood power to hold independence referendum","story":"The majority of Scots believe the power to hold a second independence referendum should be held by Holyrood over Westminster, according to a poll.A sample of , respondents across the country took part in the survey, which was conducted by Survation for polling and pro-independence think-tank Progress Scotland from between January  and .It found % of those who expressed an opinion believe the Scottish Parliament should ultimately decide on the holding of a future independence referendum while % believe it should be Westminster. - Mhairi Black: A wildcat Scottish independence referendum should be considered Progress Scotland managing director Angus Robertson said: \"There is a strong majority amongst voters in Scotland that it should be the Scottish Parliament that decides on the future holding of an independence referendum.\"Last week UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson declined the request from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon for Holyrood to have the powers over such a vote.

A government source said: “The First Minister will outline things in more detail, but this policy is one that has worked well in Canada and Australia and within specic provinces and states there. They have shown it’s possible to have dferent approaches in dferent parts of a sovereign state.”In a document published last year “Scotland’s Population Needs and Migration Policy” the Scottish Government did explore how a devolved visa scheme could operate. The paper called for the devolution of migration policy “within a UK framework to meet Scotland’s needs” and said Scottish ministers would set the criteria and rules for a visa to enter the UK which would allow migrants to “live and work in Scotland with a Scottish tax code”, with holders unable to live where in the UK.It added: “The Scottish tax code is an example of an existing framework based on residence. Both migrants themselves and employers recruiting workers would have a choice of routes through the UK immigration system. They could still apply for one of the other visas within the UK immigration system, which would allow for living and working in Scotland with the ability to move where in the UK. “Alternatively, a devolved ‘Scottish visa’ would be an additional option for people who want to live, work and eventually settle in Scotland, and would not place additional administrative burdens on businesses or iniduals. “The ‘Scottish visa’ would be an extra option in the UK system, and not a separate bureaucratic process. The Scottish Government would want to work in partnership with the UK Government to deliver this additional ‘Scottish visa’.” The paper goes on to suggest that the Scottish visa would not have a “sponsorship role” for employers, which would “remove a signicant burden from the small and medium enterprises which make up a higher share of the economy in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. “Employers taking on someone holding this visa would not need to be licenced by the Home Office, as it would not be a sponsored visa. Furthermore, the immigration skills charge would not apply, as currently defined by the UK, and there would be no salary threshold – although earnings could be part of the selection process, encouraging highly skilled people to take up quality jobs in Scotland but not excluding anyone solely on the basis of salary. “Other countries such as Australia and Canada have regional immigration schemes to allow states and provinces to attract and retain people with the skills and attributes needed to benefit the local economy and local communities.”The announcement on a Scottish visa comes just a week after the First Minister attempted to reassure EU migrants ahead of Brexit telling them Scotland “is as much your home as it is my home” and urging them to remain in the country. She also said she understood the “resentment” at having to apply for the right to stay in the UK.Yesterday both Scottish Labour and the Scottish Conservatives gave a cautious welcome to the idea. Scottish Labour’s culture, tourism and external affairs spokesperson Claire Baker said: “Scottish Labour supports exploring a degree of flexibility within an overarching UK immigration system. We look forward to seeing the detail of the proposals.”A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives added: “We’re willing to look at any proposal which helps Scotland prosper in this new era. It’s essential the SNP government’s motives for this are to make Brexit work, not to stoke up ision and agitate for independence.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nafc pair shortlisted in national lantra finals ","story":"Valentina Romano and Jimmy Dakin are in the running for the Lantra Scotland awards.Jimmy Dakin from Sanday in Orkney has been shortlisted as Aquaculture Learner of the Year.

Meanwhile, also send the data to Inverness, and have them monitor and log on how many occasions and for what duration the data received is either interrupted or of inadequate quality.If the system is as resilient as HIAL claim, they have nothing to worry about or hide, the local controllers will have no complaints about using monitors instead of looking out the window, there will have been no data interruptions to Inverness, and any deterioration in data quality will have been minimal.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

Speaking to the BBCs Sunday Politics programme, Lord Trimble spoke about their visit to the families of Philip Allen and Damien Trainor - one a Protestant, one a Catholic - who were gunned down in a Co Armagh pub. The two friends were shot dead by the LVF more than twenty years ago in whats been described as one of the most sickening attacks of the Troubles. The SDLPs Mr Mallon and former UUP leader Lord Trimble visited their families in a powerful display of unity at the time. \"Seamus had come down from Markethill and I had come from Lisburn,\" Lord Trimble recalled. \"I came to the house of one of the victims and Seamus was there. My close protection officers were ushering me towards the car and Seamus said why dont we walk through the village and I said yes.\"Lord Trimble said the pair took their time walking through the village of Poyntzpass in March  so that they would be seen talking to each other. \"There are a number of people who told me after the event that when they saw that, they realised there was a possibility of things working. Up until then, politics in Northern Ireland hadnt worked and hadnt delivered. \"But now, people saw something which indicated maybe this time its going to be dferent, and of course it was.\"Speaking about when he and Mr Mallon first started working as First and Deputy First Minister, Lord Trimble said they were in a position of having to implement the Good Friday Agreement, which was signed that year. \"None of us had run anything before. The first few months were dficult but we very quickly developed a way of handling the issues and we worked closely together over a signicant period of time.\"When asked about their personal relationship outside of politics, Lord Trimble said he and Mr Mallon had to trust each other in order to work together. \"Theres no point in continually scoring points, youve got to actually work with the people who are there and work together to succeed.\"We had to get things done and that meant we had a working relationship and that means you can trust the other person and you have some idea of what the other person would want.\"He described Mr Mallon as someone who understood unionists and unionism. \"We knew his neighbours and he was friends with his neighbours and he had therefore a better view of things. \"Some nationalists dont have any understanding of unionism at all, Seamus was not one of them.\"Speaking of his last visit to Mr Mallon in Markethill, Co Armagh last week, he said: \"It was important to him and it was important to me too.

there has been no reassurance from the British authorities whom they have “struggled” to contact, possibly because of the time dference and them being closed over the weekend.They have about five days of food left and are keeping in touch with colleagues online while the scene outside is now like a “ghost town”.Ms Hunt said emailing and trying to ring the authorities has brought a “useless automated response back from the embassy saying not to go” to the area.She feels the Chinese authorities have made the right decision by shutting down the city, adding: “All we keep hearing is that the death toll is accelerating every day. All we can do really is sit tight and wait for more news.”One British man, who had travelled to Wuhan to visit his girlfriend, is stuck in the city after hisflight on February  was cancelled, and he described trying to get out of the area as “impossible”.The -year-old, who did not want to be named, told the PA news agency: “There is no news on when the airport will reopen therefore the airlinehave just cancelled the flight.“I’ve also had no help from the UK Embassy in Beijing who are conveniently closed for the weekend.”Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said his “best guess” was that , people had been infected with the flu-like virus.Authorities in China have cancelled a host of events marking Chinese New Year as they expand their measures against the virus."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/a469a/38891653.ece/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Scotland-protestors-2.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon heckled over snps ira links in scottish parliament","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And we’ll talk.”Asked what he would say to Meghan, he told the programme: “I’d say: ‘I love you’, and: ‘Let’s sit down and work this out.’ She was the closest thing to me for years and years and years, until she went off to college and even then.“This is ridiculous. We should get together.”Mr Markle is the main witness for Associated Newspapers, owner of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, in its response to Meghan’s legal action over an article featuring parts of a handwritten letter to her father.Its always on your mind. You wake up with it. You go to sleep with it. Its very hard to deal with.Thomas MarkleThe duchess’s defence is seeking damages from the publisher for alleged misuse of private information,infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act.In court documents, the publisher argues an article in US People was sanctioned by the duchess and its effect “was to suggest that Mr Markle has made  claims about his dealings with his daughter and that he was entirely at fault in not attending the royal wedding and for the estrangement between himself and the claimant”.“I’ll see Meghan in court,” Mr Markle said to The Sun.“I wish it hadn’t come to this, but I will certainly testy against the things that have been said about me.“When me and Meghan end up in a courtroom together, it will be quite stunning for everybody.”Asked about the possibility of meeting Meghan and Harry at court as part of the legal action, Mr Markle told Good Morning Britain: “If it comes to meeting them in a courtroom, that’s great. At least I’d finally get to see them.”He went on to say he did not want a “battle”.Legal documents submitted to the High Court shed light on the relationship between Meghan and her father, with Mr Markle claiming he contributed tens of thousands to her education, paying private school fees, university tuition costs and her student loan even after her career as an actress took off.Asked about how he is trying to contact his daughter, he said: “For me, there is no other way to reach them. I pretty much will give an interview and wait for  days for some kind of answer back.“If I don’t get one back then I’ll try another interview.”Asked what he would say to people who are critical of him doing TV interviews, Mr Markle said: “I would tell them to try being in my position for a while and see what it’s like – have a family member ghost you and not speak to you, and see how you feel.“It’s something that stays with you   every day, and it never goes away.“It’s always on your mind. You wake up with it. You go to sleep with it. It’s very hard to deal with.”Speaking about the couple’s decision to step back as senior members of the royal family, Mr Markle said it is “never going to work”, adding: “I think they’ve hurt the Queen. I think they’ve hurt the royals.”He said: “I’m a little embarrassed for them, and feeling very sorry for the Queen.”Mr Markle said he thinks Harry should have travelled to see him to ask for Meghan’s hand in marriage.“I actually think Harry should have come to me at the beginning. He asked for her hand over the phone, and I actually think that in hindsight now I think that a royal, who has a plane at any time he wants it, could have come down to Mexico and asked for her hand in person to me,” he said. Mr Markle said he still feels that Harry could reach out to him now, adding: “This shouldn’t keep going on. I mean they are putting this… making this a big drama for the world every day is kind of ridiculous.“It’s a family problem. It should be solved as a family problem.” Mr Markle has claimed the duchess sent him only occasional “modest” financial gts after landing a role in the hit TV series Suits, even though he was still paying off her college debts.An extract from a responding letter from Meghan, published by the Mail on Sunday and on MailOnline in February last year, read: “Your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces – not simply because you have manufactured such unnecessary and unwarranted pain, but by making the choice to not tell the truth as you are puppeteered in this. Something I will never understand.”Her lawyers claim that, had the letter been published in full, it would have “undermined the defendant’s intended negative characterisation” of her.They also say the “true sentiment” of the letter was Meghan’s concern about her father’s welfare and his exploitation by tabloid newspapers which he should stop talking to.The publisher’s lawyers have accused the duchess of being more worried about the “unflattering” effect of the publication of letter extracts written to her estranged father than any breach of her data protection rights.The relationship between Meghan and her father broke down completely in the week of her wedding in May , a few months before the letter – thought to be the last communication between the pair – was sent.Harry and Meghan are dropping their HRH styles and stepping down from royal duties in search of freedom away from the monarchy, and will raise Archie mostly in Canada."},{"url":null,"title":"rabbit hops on board for ride on london bus","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We had to go to Pennyburn. googletag.cmd.push  Derek McCauley, founder member of Shantallow Community Centre. Photo - Deirdre Heaney, nwpresspics  The move was a big culture shock.I saw a very urgent need to get an organisation together to improve the situation.I felt what was needed was a tenants association.The seeds of the Shantallow Tenants Association were sown when the residents began organising bus runs to Moville and Malin.It was a great opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other and there was a general consensus that more should be done for the young families in the area.In , just before the outbreak of the Troubles, Mr McCauley wrote  to the Belfastasking for help as he knew there were a lot of tenants associations in the Greater Belfast area.Groups from across the North advised him how to go about setting up a tenants association.The Highfield Tenants, Association, Amalgamated Corporation Tenants Asso- ciation, Tullycarnet Tenants Association, Lyne Social Club in Larne, North Belfast Tenants Association and the National Federation of Tenants Associations all wrote to me.I received lots of replies and they supplied me very useful advice.Most of these associations were political and non sectarian and I still have those letters.The main theme of these letters was use your politicians, but dont let them use you.The first meeting was held in a small gun club in the area by founder members, Danny Cooley, Tom Doherty, Sally Fleming and Mr McCauley.Mr McCauley was elected as chairman and Mr Cooley was elected as treasurer and it quickly became clear a community centre was needed.We put a questionnaire around the estate asking would they like a centre and what they would like to see in it and we got a great response.The association met with the Housing Trust  and made their case.We met with a lady called Miss MCCullough. She was a great help to us and I think we struck a chord with her, said Mr McCauley.The reason we were successful was because we were non political and non sectarian.When we went to ask for anything we asked politely and we didnt demand it.The Shantallow Community Centre was the first of its type to be built in the city and cost pound,.Its was only supposed to last  years, said Mr McCauley.The centre was soon a hive of activity and people came from across the city to use it.We had a childrens play group, handicraft classes, Irish dancing classes, piano lessons, a childrens disco and a youth disco on a Saturday night.It was the only disco of its kind in the city at that time we had young people coming from Newbuildings and the foot of Bishop Street for that.You would find them standing outside after and they had no way of getting home, so I would have given them a lt in my big yellow Zephyr.Everyone remembers the Zephyr. If I go to a wake in Shantallow people say to me do you still have that big yellow car The list of activities at the centre continued to grow with gymnastics, rollerskating, indoor bowls and bingo.In  they held a cross community festival for all the churches in the area.It was a good time, said Mr McCauley.It was all young families living in the area and on the summer days you would have thought there was a swarm of bees out on the back square but it would just have been all the children.That was before phones and Playstations.The work of the centre stretched far outside its doors with bus runs, dinner dances, outdoor festivals, sports competitions and luncheon clubs.Mr McCauley dedicated countless hours to it, but he said none of it would have been possible without the support of his we, Rita, who sadly passed away two years ago.She was the most important person, he said.We had six children and she had to rear them all.Mr McCauley eventually retired from the Tenants Association in , but not before he shared his knowledge with community groups across the city. A long list of people gave many volunteer hours to the Shantallow Tenants Association and Community Centre.I would like to wish all future communities the success we had and give a special thanks to all those people who made it so successful. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, DUP Alderman for the area, David Ramsey, has welcomed the commencement of demolition work at the site and he believes a boundary and fencing offers enough protection. Radius Housing Association submitted an application in May  to construct forty-nine residential units with associated landscape and access works on the site of the former Ebrington Primary School. The application is currently under consideration with a view to bringing it before Derry City  Strabane District Council’s Planning Committee at the “earliest opportunity”, a council spokesperson confirmed. googletag.cmd.push The site has lain vacant since Ebrington P.S. relocated to a new site on the Limavady Road in . In that time there have been issues with anti-social behaviour and the building was badly damaged in two arson attacks. The planned housing development is situated in a backland site between the Limavady Road and Rossdowney Road on lands south of Glendermott Cricket Club. Documents associated with the application show that the Council’s Environmental Health Service has raised concerns about the possibility of cricket balls struck at the Glendermott C.C. ground landing in the housing development - particularly when professional players are batting as they can hit the ball a greater distance. googletag.cmd.push Each team in the league is permitted the use of one professional overseas player and up to  competitive games at first class cricket level could also be played during the season. The document states: “It is recognised that cricket balls can travel a distance of up to .m and within the proposed development. Cricket balls that travel a distance more than .m will therefore land within the development boundary and on the roadway. “Such cricket balls will not stop dead but will have sufficient momentum to travel a further distance with the potential to strike adjacent property, vehicles and pedestrians. “Therefore, it is anticipated that the overall frequency of first class standard play with the ability to hit a ball up to . metres and the potential to cause damage to property persons has increased beyond that stated in the GM Design risk assessment.”  Much-needed DUP Alderman for the Waterside area, David Ramsey, welcomed progress towards construction at the site. He said: “At long last the demolition has begun, Glendermott CC and the surrounding community will be delighted. The site should be cleared by February and as far as I’m aware Radius is ready to move in and start work. “This now means progress on the much needed affordable housing and improved green space will be commencing soon. “Many people have great memories of this building, end of an era and making way for a new beginning.” Cllr Ramsey went on to explain that he and other party representatives have been “inundated” with housing related issues from constituents. The Waterside area is in need of  bungalows to meet the current demand with many elderly and disabled residents in search of single-storey houses. Glendermott Cricket Club is also pleased that it will get ground back that was taken away when the former school was built, Cllr Ramsey added. New residents moving into the area could also prove positive in terms of recruiting new members to the club.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar. St Finbarrs registration for the  season takes place in Meadowbank on Tuesday, January  and Tuesday, February  at ..

He was always destined for success. His mother Catriona is an Ulster and All-Ireland champions camogie player, before moving into coaching where titles also streamed in her direction. Garys father Ronnie and grandfather George are steeped in motorbikes. On a dferent tangent, his sister Lara is both a champion gymnast and trampolinist. Sport simply runs in the family. For the  year-old St Patricks Maghera pupil, he has excelled in the world of motorsport despite only going into his third season in the saddle. Gary has competed on the Irish minibike circuit since its inception in , finishing second in the junior class, before graduating to the senior ranks last season. googletag.cmd.push In recent weeks, he was awarded the prestigious David Wood scholarship which the Motorcycle Union of Ireland awards to its most promising rider. It was won for the first time in  by Lee Johnston, winner of the last seasons Junior Isle of Man TT winner. He also took on the role of IMC Youth Ambassador – to act as a role-model for our younger members. “During this time Gary has shown maturity beyond his years, building up a great rapport with our Junior Members and his peers,” commented IMC Chairman Mark Boyd. “In addition to his abilities as a competitor, his positive attitude in success or defeat coupled with the clear commitment shown by both Gary and his family to his budding racing career bode well for his future. googletag.cmd.push “As Chairman of The Irish Minibike Championship I am privileged to recommend Gary for inclusion in the  BTC and wish him every success with the selection process.” His mothers reluctance stalled Garys career until just before his th birthday but she is now fully behind him since his early short circuit days. In , he progressed to the IMC Senior Open and Ulster Superbike Moto Championship. “Last year he was doing pit bikes with young kids but this year he went on to the short circuits and he was racing against adults, when he won the Moto championship,” Catriona said. “Now he is hoping to go to the British Superbikes on a Moto as well.” “As a rookie in the USBK Moto Championship, against some very experienced and older riders I came away with the title USBK Moto Champion ,” Gary outlined in his CV, which has been compiled with the view to attracting sponsorship for this season and a shot at the Moto class. The costings for next season could amount to over poundk, including a pound, Honda NSFR bike, entry fees and travel. “At the end of next year my aim is to make a wildcard into the Spanish Championship with my future dream to ride in the World Championships,” Gary added. He grew up watching and supporting both his father and grandfather in action on both the circuits and roads. It was no surprise to see him emerge from their shadows. His family helped him raise the funds for a trip to Donnington to compete in a round of the British Superbikes to help gather invaluable experience and a taste of what  could bring. MCUI Trainer and respected journalist and photographer Baylon McCaughey was full of praise for Gary. “Despite the cold and wet weather Gary, despite having only one season of tarmac racing under his belt in Pit Bike Racing, showed great enthusiasm and certainly was not afraid to ask questions,” he said. “After each session, he would enquire,he was doing the correct thing or not, and listened to advice given. “With plans to compete in the British Championships, I know this lad has the correct approach to his racing, his manners off the track, and competitiveness on the track, will certainly help him to achieve his goals.” Talent, with an attitude to match. Perhaps the greatest combination. If the next two years follow his meteoric rise since , Gary Scott is destined for greatness. Remember the name.

It was a carbon copy of last seasons opener, in Paacuteirc Esler, when Alan Grants goal was the dference between the sides. Cormac ODoherty was in unerring form from frees, as was his opposite number Oisin McManus. Both landed  in all, but it was the Slaughtneil mans two vital strikes when Down were forcing a comeback ensured Derry kept themselves on course for victory. googletag.cmd.push Former Celtic Challenge winning captain Eoghan Cassidy notched a point on his debut but when the game was in the melting pot late on, he won two vital puck-outs, which will have pleased John McEvoy. Another plus was the performance of Eamon McGill and Brian Oacuteg McGilligan at the heart of the Derry defence. Noted more as a forward, Darragh Cartin excelled in a new role at corner-back. Behind Derrys defence, goalkeeper Sean Kelly was their wall. His handling was impeccable and he made a fine save to deny Eoghan Sands.

But with the breeze at their backs, Sean Kellys long puck-outs helped shape the game. It had Derry camped in the Down defence for virtually the entire half. The Kevin Lynchs man took a short puck out and again gaining the , his long ball evaded Down corner back Darragh Mallon and Richie Mullan, after scuffing his first effort, finished well from an acute angle for a - to - lead after eight minutes. Derry needed Brian Oacuteg McGilligan to intercept from MacManus with a snf of goal on. Paul Cleary, ODoherty and Odhraacuten McKeeveradded points from play to help John McEvoys side into a - to - interval lead. Down reshuffled their pack at half-time and began with more purpose. MacManus floated over an early point and Sands had a shot smothered by Eamon McGill, who repelled three attacks in as many minutes. The visitors, who had a productive pre-season in Leinsters Kehoe Cup, came at Derry strongly in the third quarter. They couldve found the net but when goalkeeper Kelly got his angles spot on, McGill made another block before Paddy Kelly cleared the danger. A goal wouldve left two points between the sides. Derry pushed on but Down bounded back. MacManus arrowed three frees in succession and with  minutes to go, the margin was cut back to the goal, - to -. ODoherty against answered the call with two points and when Sean Kellys long free to Jerome McGuigan wasnt cleared, Steafan McCloskey passed to Conor Kelly for an excellent score. Thomas Brady landed the insurance point before being sent off, one two bookings, during injury time. Tom Murray left three points between the teams, six minutes into stoppage time but it as Cassidys two vital possessions and a late defensive intervention from Brian Oacuteg McGilligan that sealed Derrys winning start.

The two teams met in the  and  Finals but the Galway representatives will be hoping for a dferent result at Croke Park on March . googletag.cmd.push Slaughtneil laid the foundation for their triumph in the first-half, when they had the wind in their favour and defended resolutely after the resumption against an outfit that has made tremendous progress in recent seasons, having lost an All-Ireland Junior Final just four years ago. Former Offaly star Tina Bradley inflicted much of the damage, hitting - of her personal tally of - in that opening period. Bradley’s fortuitous goal after  minutes was a key moment as her free flew all the way to the net at a juncture when Scarf Ogonnelloe were trailing by just a point. Bradley , Louise Dougan and Shannon Graham had all given Slaughtneil the lead but Marion Rodgers, Maireacutead Scanlan on the double had kept their Clare opponents very much in touch. googletag.cmd.push Therese Mallon rattled in a second goal just five minutes after Bradley’s strike, after receiving an excellent pass from Josie McMullan, and at the other end, Jolene Bradley saved splendidly from Rodgers, contributing to a - to - advantage at the break. That enabled Slaughtneil to dig in though Scarf Ogonnelloe threw everything at them after the resumption and kept the Ulster side to two points, from Graham and Tina Bradley. Rodgers , Lynda Daly and Scanlan raised white flags but they needed a goal and though the excellent Rodgers did strike, it was almost the last act of the game and too late to deny Slaughtneil. Contrary to Slaughtneil, Sarsfields did the damage in the second half, leading by just a point at the interval, - to -. It was a cagey opening period, Niamh Hetherton and skipper Ali Maguire doing well for Vincent’s, Siobhaacuten McGrath proving deadly accurate for Sarsfields. The youngest of four McGrath sisters on the team finished as top scorer with  points, two of those from play, but it was the second half goal of Rachel Murray six minutes into the second half that really turned the tide, as she deflected the sliotar to the net following Niamh McGrath’s long free. The Dublin team did have opportunities but the absence of injured former All-Star Aisling Maher was keenly felt. Sarsfields’ dominance was undoubted however, and Siobhaacuten McGrath was able to enjoy the luxury of opting to take points from two penalties, while siblings Niamh and Orlaith also got on the scoresheet for what was ultimately a comfortable victory.

Lyndon Stephens died that morning after battling stoically against illness. His record label, Quiet Arch, was already planning to go into hiatus due to his illness and had planned a farewell gig in the Belfast Empire for that very evening. As fate would have it, it became his wake. I am a firm believer in the human spirit being how people remember you and I prefer to gather other people’s memories for things like this. Ryan Vail: “The man that gave me a career in music, toured me around the world, put me on tv, put me on radio, made me a headline festival artist, got me sound tracking, got me remixing, got me producing, got me talking on some of the most important industry , got me the most prestigious funding awards my manager, friend, label partnerLyndon Stephens.“I was his very first signing nine years ago and stayed with him the whole time. We released together, toured together started labels together, found acts together and had hours of phone calls together daily. “To be honest it’s been so so dficult to comprehend. Im really grateful for the memories we shared together.“RIP Lyndon, thank you for changing my le”Ciaran Lavery: “I first met Lyndon Stephens at Output, Belfast. He didn’t know me or owe me anything but kept putting me forward to talk to the local press that were at the event. “After the show, he askedI’d like to chat to him about working together. “Over the course of the next five years we broke down so many walls and glass ceilings. We spoke on the phone three for four times a day every day. I could call him at ungodly hours and he always answered, he was always there, Lyndon loved to talk. He was an incredible human being with a wonderful family and friends circle. “I know that when any friend musician needed advice of funding I pointed them towards Lyndon andhe had the time, he gave it willingly. I have an incredible amount of memories. I will miss my old friend so dearly, but in truth, I am truly blessed to have met Lyndon Stephens”.Francesca O’Connor, from Quiet Arch ,said “Lyndon Stephens, a man who wanted to make a genuine dference to this world, give the underdogs a  to shine and to show the world the incredible talent coming out of Northern Ireland. “He set up an artist management company, Champion Sound Music and record label, Quiet Arch, to put Northern Ireland artists on the international stage. I will forever be grateful to him for hiring me as a trainee artist manager . years ago. “As a young female with little experience but an eagerness to learn, he gave me a chance. I can only take inspiration from his creativity, decisiveness, determination and unwavering passion to succeed to carry on what he started. “Not long ago, he sent me the poem Go All The Way by Charles Bukowski and I cant think of a better way to describe his tenacious spirit.” She concluded: A loving husband, father, sister and friend, Lyndon is undoubtedly one in a million and will never be forgotten”.Ben Magee, also of Quiet Arch said “Lyndon’s biggest strength, and of those he had many, was when he believed in you, you knew about it. He was never one to shower you with praise, butyou had Lyndon in your corner, he made you feel like you could conquer the world. “A profound, hilarious inidual who was always one step ahead of everyone  in the room, Lyndon never spent a second of his le saying goodbye. “He always had his eyes fixed squarely on the horizon, eyebrows raised, a mad cackle dancing on the corner of his mouth. He was a mentor, a confidant, an always open ear and a friend. And I will miss him dearly.”My memories of Lyndon are very similar to Ciaran’s and probably most other people’s. he was always willing to help and preferred to talk over the other means of communication. If I ever went off the deep end with one of my rants at the music scene here Lyndon would message me quickly to calmly explain how things worked and how I might be right but mostly how I was wrong. It always began with a text message but was always swtly abandoned in favour of a chat. Always knowledgeable and always reasonable I will truly miss the advice and am forever grateful for the counsel. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Announcing his candidacy, Mr Casey said he was standing in the Dublin constituency to give people an opportunity to register “an obvious protest vote” against Varadkar.“The Taoiseach’s string of failures is recorded for all to see,” he said.“There’s the swing-gate and fobgate scandals, the National Children’s Hospital disgrace, the broadband spending debacle, the unprecedented crises in health and housing – list goes on and people have had enough… “People are right to be angry and that’s why I’m giving them the opportunity to voice their anger directly by voting for me in Dublin West.”Speaking at the registration office, the -year-old said he believed Mr Varadkar was not fit to be Taoiseach, but said he would not canvas there, adding that his primary goal would be to represent the people of Donegal.As well as the Taoiseach, Mr Casey will face competition for the Dublin constituency’s four seats from outgoing TDs Joan Burton of Labour, Fianna Faacuteil’s Jack Chambers, and Solidarity-People Before Profit’s Ruth Coppinger.Others standing in the constituency include Fine Gael’s Emer Currie, Sinn Feacutein’s Paul Donnelly, the Green Party’s Roderic O’Gorman, Aengus Oacute Maolaacutein, Aontuacute’s Edward Mac Manus and independent candidates Stephen O’Loughlin and Sean O’Leary. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Reverend David Latimer is retiring after  years as a minister at First Derry Presbyterian Church. Reverend Latimer came to prominence in the last decade through his friendship with Sinn Fein politician and former IRA man Martin McGuinness. The two men first met when Reverend Latimer appealed to Mr McGuinness to condemn a vandalism attack on First Derry church at Magazine Street in Derrys city centre. From that first meeting developed a friendship between the two men which attracted admiration and criticism. Reverend Latimer has spoken of how some of his congregation who had lost loved ones at the hands of the IRA could not accept his friendship with Mr McGuinness, who died in . googletag.cmd.push However, the local clergyman, who was originally from County Down, said that his relationship with Mr McGuinness was part of a reconciliation process between dferent communities. That theme was evident today at Reverend Latimers final Sunday service at First Derry church. Among the packed congregation were members of Mr McGuinnesss family along with leading Sinn Fein figures. Speaking at the service, Reverend Latimer said he was sad that Mr McGuinness could not be with them but was grateful that his we, Bernie, and other family members could be there. He said it was important that communities reached out the hand of friendship to each other. googletag.cmd.push “We must hold hands, not grudges,” said Reverend Latimer. The service was co-celebrated by local Catholic priest, Father Michael Canny, who paid tribute to his colleague. For more on todays service see tomorrows Derry News.

Patients registered to a MDT practice are able to book an appointment directly with any of these new services, without first having to see their GP. The model also includes signicant investment in additional nursing specialist roles such as health visiting and district nursing.The Derry GP Federation was one of the first areas in Northern Ireland to benefit from this transformation initiative. Since its introduction, just over one year ago, over , patient appointments have taken place with these new MDT staff.The project has recruited signicant numbers of additional staff to work within GP practices. Seventy two staff are already in post and  more are due to start in coming months. To accommodate these additional staff, a signicant programme of capital investment in the buildings which house GP practices has been accompanying the project.Dr Martin McCloskey, chairperson of the Derry Federation of Family Practices, said the introduction of the initiative in the Derry area had resulted in an increase in capacity in GP practices. “The approach sees our practice teams being supported to identy opportunities for early intervention, with an increased focus on the physical, mental and social wellbeing of our communities. We are now beginning to see the rewards and are confident that MDTs will not only improve the health and well being of our local communities but help to secure the future of general practice in the North West.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Stute also drew a blank in terms of goals for the seventh time in that period, and with Warrenpoint grabbing a late win at Carrick, the Blues have now slipped to last place after several weeks of treading water.It is a concerning time for Connor and his and with a game against the Point just a few weeks away, they will be hoping to get a win out of somewhere before that huge six-pointer.Whilst Stute improved in the second half of Saturdays game, they did not do enough to test home goalkeeper Conor Byrne throughout, and not for the first time this season, indiscipline in their own penalty area cost them as they conceded yet another penalty. Connor made a number of changes as he tried to freshen things up, bringing in Conor Tourish, Cormac Burke and Ahu Obhakhan for Evan Tweed, Oran Brogan and Alex Pomeroy, who all dropped to the bench.New signing Obhakhan almost gted Dungannon a goal as early as the fourth minute as his pass found Caolan McAleer, but the ex-Finn Harps mans long range drive failed to trouble Stute goalkeeper Rory Brown. The last two games between these sides had been memorable for all sorts of reasons, but this was not following suit as both teams struggled for inspiration, half chances falling for Dungannon as Terry Fitzpatricks tame effort was easily gathered by a ing Brown before the Stute goalkeeper saved from Hughes from distance. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -Stute upped their efforts after the break and they finally tested the hosts when Joe McCreadys low drive was saved at the second attempt by Swts keeper Byrne.That was the beginning of the best period in the game for the visitors and just before the hour mark Currys header from Burkes left wing corner caused problems for Swts, who somehow scrambled the ball awya from danger. Stutres vulnerability at set-plays cost them dearly just after the hour mark when Dungannon finally broke through, McAleers cross finding King at the back post who powerfully headed home. That changed the momentum of the game and the lead was doubled just over ten minutes later when Tourish brought down McAleer inside the box, leaving referee Tony Clarke with no option but to point to the spot. Douglas Wilson made no mistake with the resulting penalty, drilling the ball low into Browns bottom left hand corner to seal the points. Stute had no answer and Swts should have added a third when Hughes fed an unmarked McAleer, but with only Brown to beat, the winger fired wide with the goal at his mercy.In the closing stages Gareth Brown went close to grabbing a consolation as his snap-shot beat Byrne but flashed just wide. googletag.cmd.push TeamsDungannon Swts: Byrne, Lowe, Wilson, King, Teggart Campbell, Fitzpatrick , Smyth , McAleer Carvill, Hughes .Institute: R Brown, Morrow, Tourish, D Curry, McLaughlin G Brown, McCauley , Crown, BurkeMcCready , Obhakhan.Referee: Tony Clarke .

Greg Hutley also came in at out-half and took on the kicking duties.The home side started superbly, snapping into tackles and looking dangerous with ball in hand. Aaron Cairns continued his excellent try-scoring form, running a superb line and cutting through under the posts for Hutley to convert.Ryan Wilson then finished a superb counter attack led by Hutley and full back Paddy Wright to take the locals into a - lead after  minutes and it looked like a very comfortable victory was on the cards.However, Dungannon had clearly not read theand upped their physicality, carrying hard from deep and attacking the fringes of the rucks.Passive Ballynahinch defence allowed their hooker to cruise in untouched under the posts after taking a fine offload from his second row.Worse was to come when more missed tackles sent Dungannon into the break with a - lead following a second converted try.Ballynahinch visibly upped the tempo in the third quarter and put the game to bed with an -point scoring burst.They went through the phases in the Dungannon  and Bradley Luney capped a fine display by bursting through for a score to take his side into the lead.Two Hutley penalties followed as Dungannon infringed under severe pressure to make the score - and when replacement winger Ronan Patterson ran a beautul line to score in the opposite corner Ballynahinch looked home and dry at -.They allowed Dungannon a glimpse of a comeback by taking their foot off the pedal again and Dungannon scored a breakout try and conversion to take them within nine points, but the result was never in question.The Ballynahinch faithful can look forward to another trip to Kingspan for the final against familiar foes City of Armagh on Friday, March .Ballynahinch : Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Jonny Blair, Bradley Luney, John Donnan, Tom Martin, Olly Loughead, Callum Irvine, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Robin Harte, George Pringle, Paddy Wright, David Cooper, Nacho Caldera, Kelvin Hamilton, Ronan Patterson, Ben McMullan.Ballynahinch Dungannon SENIOR CUP SEMI-FINAL.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Outstanding.jpg","title":"‘Outstanding’ school report for Cumran  ","story":"CUMRAN Primary School in Clough has received top marks in its latest inspection report.The school was deemed to be ldquooutstanding in the three areas that the Education and Training Inspectorate assess for mdash outcomes for learners, quality of provision and leadership.The schoolrsquos social communication unit mdash which educates  children on the Autism spectrum who have a iety of needs mdash was also rated as outstanding.The school currently has  pupils with  of them on the Special Educational Needsregister.Eight of the pupils have statements of educational need.The inspection report praised the pupils in its key findings for their achievements and learning and said: ldquoIn this school, the children lead the learning. The children work effectively and take personal responsibility for working collaboratively with their peers.ldquoThey seek and respect fully the views and opinions of each other, and take great pride in sharing their learning with others.The report also said that the childrenrsquos behaviour was ldquoexemplary and described the outcomes for children in literary, numeracy and ICT and the schoolrsquos leadership as ldquooutstanding.Cumran PS was also praised for achieving ICT awards, which included the Digital School of Distinction Award, the Capital Excellence Award and two National Association of Advisors for Computers in Education.It has also been accredited as a lsquoThinking Schoolrsquo, a rights respecting school at silver level and an ambassador Eco School, holding an eighth green flag.School principal, Mrs Rhonda Moles, said she and the staff were delighted.ldquoCumran has yet again achieved the lsquooutstandingrsquo category in every area mdash the quality of education provided,quality of the childrenrsquos achievements and standards, the provision for learning, leadership and management and pastoral care.Mrs Moles said Cumran Primary is committed to providing the best possible education for children, with the inspection report recognising that the children are at the heart of all decision making in school and that they lead the learning.She added: ldquoThis is a great affirmation for all in the school community and identies Cumran as being at the forefront of primary education.ldquoI would like to thank the hard working and committed staff, the supportive governors and parents and highly motivated children for making our school the success it is.Cumran opened as a new school in May  following the amalgamation of Clough and Downshire Primary Schools..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Charity.jpg","title":"Charity encouraging children to walk or take bike to school  ","story":"A LOCAL politician is encouraging more children to walk or cycle to school mdashit is safe to do so.Rowallane politician Billy Walker is supportive of the drive by Sustrans to reduce the number of children travelling to school by car, but warns that for many who attend primary schools in rural areas especially, walking or cycling to school could place them in danger.Sustrans mdash which is a walking and cycling charity mdash said recent figures published by the Department for Infrastructure show that increasing numbers of children travel to school by car.Anne Madden from Sustrans described the increasing number as ldquotruly woeful and said the fact that the number of primary children being driven to school has risen from % to % since   shows ldquosociety has a lot more to do.She says it is known from surveys that road safety is the main reason why parents drive their children to school, but the charity official said it is these parents who are adding to congestion and air pollution at the school gates.Ms Madden says there needs to be improvements in infrastructure such as footpaths and traffic crossings to enable more active travel.The latest government figures have revealed that as many as % of primary school pupils who are being driven to school live less than a mile away, which Ms Madden describes as a ldquovery walkable distance.She added: ldquoWalking or cycling to school is a simple way of incorporating more exercise into a childrsquos daily routine. This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development. Redeveloping the expansive Irish Street site can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment and will provide a boost for existing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down senior footballers face tough opener  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS senior footballers head for Clonmel on Sunday more in hope than optimism to open their Division  Allianz League campaign against Tipperary.Paddy Tallyrsquos charges face a tough opening game as the Premier County, who were relegated from Division  last season, will be like a wounded animal and determined to bounce back into the leaguersquos second tier.The sides met last June at Pairc Esler when Down won an All-Ireland Qualier - to -. Pat Havern, Corey Quinn and Donal OrsquoHare did most of the scoring that day, but Tipperary will be a dferent proposition at the weekend.New Tipp manager David Power, who famously led the county minors to an All-Ireland title in , has an abundance of talent at his disposal, but he will have to without star player Michael Quinlivan.The Clonmel Commercials man has decided to go travelling for a year and his absence is a huge loss to Tipperaryrsquos attack and the countyrsquos bid to regain their status in the top flight ahead of next seasonrsquos championship changes.Promotion is also a must for Down as well, as they too have huge aspirations of avoiding competing in the All-Ireland second tier competition.Down have just emerged from an indferent McKenna Cup campaign.Wins over Fermanagh and Antrim were cast aside when Tallyrsquos team were given a reality check by Tyrone in the semi-finals.Mickey Hartersquos experimental side simply over-powered Down and had too much physicality all over the park.Hopefully, Down will have learned from that game, but second guessing Tallyrsquos team selection ahead of Sunday is a dficult job.Definitely missing Sundayrsquos game will be vice-captain Caolan Mooney, the one player in the camp who has the ability to stand out from the rest. His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night. Second was st Ballyroney, with st Raffrey finishing third.This is the most prestigious event in the Battalion calendar and a very high standard of drill was set by the locals, who have been practicing the movements for the past four months.Apart from the squad competition, there was also a squad commandant cup presented at Banbridge and Sgt M Cuffey, of Crossgar, was the winner.The overall competition was chaired by Mr D Partridge, Battalion president, assisted by Mr R Dickson, Battalion secretary. The judges were Mr E Torrans and Mr W Price, both from Belfast.LISSARA mdash A call has been made for a new minister for Lissara Presbyterian Church at Crossgar.He is the Rev Samuel Armstrong, at present assistant at Abbey Presbyterian Church, Monkstown, and he will succeed the Rev S A Matthew who left for Bannside Church in Banbridge seven months ago.Mr Armstrong is married with three children mdash twin daughters aged seven and another aged  months. He is a graduate of Queenrsquos University and worked as a physicist with Goodyear and British Enkalon.Rev Armstrong has also completed one yearrsquos voluntary service overseas in Ghana.

Apart from a travelling scholarship he once won to study design, this is undoubtedly Mr Wilkinsonrsquos first big success.ldquoIt was one occasion when I believed designers should make a real effort to present a project. I entered it, wanting to do the best I could. Naturally I aimed to win itpossible, Mr Mr Wilkinson.He received pound from the Environment Minister Mr Philip Goodhart on Tuesday. He will also be responsible for the construction of his sculpture and act as consultant for the overall design.Runner-up in the contest was Mr Ernest Frazer, from Carryduff, a designer with the Chief Architectrsquos Branch Department of Finance.

They say they are simply removing mercury out of the rotating lens system and putting in a new ldquoinnovative mechanical bearing solution, insisting that the changes are not being driven by any directive to make savings.In addition, CIL argues that plans to replace the existing filament light with a modern LED will not result in major changes to the sweeping beam.They contend that the proposed changes will deliver a ldquobetter quality, environmentally superior solution which aligns with current health and safety requirements and allow for the retention of the historic Fresnel rotating lens which was installed in .Commissioners also insist that the range of the new LED light will be  miles in accordance with the Navigation Requirements for the UK and Ireland, with St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse continuing to provide an essential safety service for mariners as it has done since a light was first established in Killough in .During a public meeting last year to discuss the proposed changes at the lighthouse, CIL was urged by concerned residents and politicians to leave the lighthouse as it is and not to do anything to harm its heritage.There was also a warning that there would be ldquoructions at all levelsthe proposed changes were implemented, with several people pointing to the potential for the lighthouse to be transformed into a unique leading visitor attraction which would provide an economic boost for the area.Residents opposed to changes argue that Killough boasts the ldquofinest example of a lighthouse of its kind and that no one is in

geopark bid  ","story":"A NEW management team has been established to oversee three stunning areas of outstanding natural beauty which are at the heart of the districtrsquos bid to secure a world renowned tourism designation.Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion feature heavily in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for prestigious UNESCO geopark status which has the potential to generate millions of pounds in tourism revenue.Typical activities in geoparks include the development of walking and cycling trails, training local people to act as guides, the provision of information signs and the development of visitor centres.Northern Irelandrsquos only other current geopark mdash the Marble Arch Caves which inhabits the rugged mountainous uplands and gentle rolling lowlands of counties Cavan and Fermanagh mdash contributes just over poundm to the economy in this area.Local council officials, who confirmed a pre-Christmas Recorder story that the formal bid for geopark status had been submitted, have revealed that an Area of Outstanding Natural Beautymanagement team for the three local areas has been created.Council officials say that they are continuing to work secure geopark status which is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism.But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a so-called bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020

The tourism season in Newcastle is now all-year long and we want to keep the car-park open.Cllr Devlin said that the council was ldquoa victim of its own success in being able to attract the numbers of visitors to the town.She questioned the proposalrsquos contention that Newcastlersquos parking demand ldquosignicantly decreases during the winter months.ldquoIt used to be that we would have parking problems during particular times such as the Festival of Flight and bank holidays. But now as long as its dry, Newcastle is busy and parking is a necessary part of the town centre, she said.ldquoWhen the overflow car park is not being used, itrsquos complete chaos and parking can create issues for residents in nearby folds.She asked council officers when the new overflow car-park would be open for business andthe current overflow area could be kept open in the interim to help with parking demand.Michael Lipsett, the councilrsquos director of active and healthy communities, said he envisaged the work lasting three months and promised that once the necessary planning approval was gained, his department would be preparing to tender for a contractor as soon as possible.Slieve Croob Cllr Andrew McMurray queried whether the car-park would be a ldquoblanket tarmac covering andit would encroach on the green space.He was told that the proposal was to use a synthetic grid which would allow grass to show through so it would look green but would also indicate the car spaces available and one-way traffic system planned.Mournes Cllr Harold McKee welcomed the development as a ldquogreat idea and said parking in Newcastle was ldquoan absolute nightmare at any time of the year.Cllr Devlin suggested that the current overflow parking area should be in continuous use until the new facility is opened.However, Mr Lipsett said he currently did not have the budget available to cover this but would investigate and report back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Philip.jpg","title":"Philip and Helen in tandem at Kildare  ","story":"ON a bitterly cold Saturday morning Phillip and Helen Vint were at the start line for the latest in the East of Ireland Marathon series, at Staplestown, in North Kildare, which also provides half marathon and k alternatives, mostly for partners, like Helen who feel itrsquos nice to be there to support your other half, but who feel that running a marathon with them is pushing things a bit too far, . miles too far to be exact.The temperature was -C when they began running and a sultry +C when they finished and underfoot conditions were slippery by virtue of the frozen ice around the route.So, well done to both on completing what they describe as steady runs for their firsts of , Phillip in .. and fth place and Helen in .. and third place respectively.BornRunSaturday saw a big turnout,  in fact, for the sixth of the BornRun Run Forest Run Series.This week the venue was Gosford Country Park which will also host the NI  Ulster Intermediate and Masters Cross Country Championships next weekend.The only distance on offer this week was k and the route headed out in a loop around the start and continued towards the outer boundaries of the forest.The first k was quite level and took everyone into the scenic forest for k where there were a few small inclines, but overall it was a flat, fast course with a good run in the last k down to the finish line.No-one made better use of the terrain than East Downrsquos Jimmy Sloan, who fairly flew round the course in a superb ., which was almost two minutesahead of the second-placed Thomas Carson . with third place filled by Barry McAuley in ..I believe this is Jimmyrsquos first win in club colours and it certainly wonrsquot be his last, given his present form and continuing improvement, which in spite of hearing later that the distance was allegedly  metres short, nevertheless represents a great effort and time.

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year. Thanks should also go to the local businesses who supported and Irsquod like to encourage residents to visit their local business to support Small Business Saturday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves. The vast majority just wonrsquot be able to do this.ldquoIntroducing policy which isnrsquot fit for purpose could have severe consequences.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

They each received weekly book vouchers, provided by Egmont, to spend at Grfin Books, and coffee shop vouchers donated by local businesses.In , the families committed to reading with their children for  minutes per day.The bookshoprsquos owner, Mel Grfin, said:\"We were delighted to be selected to participate in this exciting project. The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers. This included The Bottle Shop and Loursquos for Men, who each sponsored one family for the six-week duration of the scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
