He needs 45 per cent support, or 40 per cent support with a 10 percentage point lead, over the nearest rival to avoid a runoff vote on Nov. 24. The results still need to be confirmed.       Peronist and Argentina\u0027s President-elect Alberto Fernández, waves after voting in Buenos Aires on SundayMacri was elected president in 2015 promising to jumpstart the country\u0027s economy. Argentines rejected at the time a successor chosen by Cristina Fernández, who along with her late husband dominated Argentina\u0027s political scene for 12 years and rewrote its social contract. But the isive former leader, who embodies Argentina\u0027s enduring cycle of hope and despair, is back.\u0027I\u0027m so happy. We were waiting for this change for a long time. We\u0027re tired of everything that has been happening\u0027, said supporter Juan Jose De Antonio, 46. \u0027Some of us live a different reality from those suffering hunger, but when you have a friend who lost a job, a neighbor who can\u0027t make ends meet, it hits you.\u0027Sunday\u0027s largely peaceful election was dominated by concerns over rising poverty, a sharp depreciation of the currency and one of the world\u0027s highest inflation rates. Voters appeared to have rejected austerity measures that Macri insisted were needed to revive Argentina\u0027s struggling economy. Argentines have taken to the streets frustrated with cuts subsidies that have led to rises in utilities and transportation costs.         President Mauricio Macri, who was running for reelection, throws a kiss to supporters after conceding the election next to his wife Juliana Awada waves in Buenos Aires on SundayThe result also marks a shift leftward for South America, which has seen conservative governments elected in Brazil, Colombia and Chile in recent years. Cristina Fernández was considered part of the \u0027pink tide\u0027 of leftist governments that arose in the region in the 1990s and 2000s.Now a left-leaning government appears set to govern Argentina, and governments in Chile, Peru and Ecuador fueled by discontent over corruption, inequality and slowing growth.

But overall frustration over the economy eroded the popularity of the pro-business former mayor of Buenos Aires. It also propelled the candidacy of Alberto Fernández, whose surge has sent jitters in the financial markets over a possible return to interventionist polices of Cristina Fernández\u0027s 2007-2015 administration.Macri\u0027s camp tried, but failed to capitalize on that unease, portraying her as a puppet master waiting in the wings. The presidential candidate has dismissed those fears and voters gave him a decisive victory over Macri in August primaries, which are a barometer of support for candidates ahead of the presidential election.         Voters line up in Buenos Aires on Sunday. Argentina could take a political turn with center-left Peronist President-Elect Alberto Fernández in power, taking over for incumbent Mauricio Macri amid growing frustration over the country\u0027s economic crisisAlberto Fernández served as chief of staff from 2003 to 2007 for Cristina Fernández\u0027s predecessor and late husband, Néstor Kirchner. He remained in the position during part of her term as president but left after a conflict with farmers in 2008.Peronism is a broad but splintered political movement in the South American country of 44 million people.On the election trail, Alberto Fernández criticized Macri\u0027s decision to seek a record $56 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, a deeply unpopular institution in Argentina that is blamed for creating the conditions that led to the country\u0027s worst economic meltdown in 2001.

All united\u0027 joins supporters of center-left Peronist and President-Elect Alberto Fernández and running mate, former President Cristina Fernández, outside their party\u0027s election headquarters in Buenos Aires to wait for resultsMacri is credited with returning Argentina to international global markets following a break after the 2001 crisis and with helping strike a free trade deal between South America\u0027s Mercosur bloc and the European Union amid global trade tensions and rising protectionism. But he failed to deliver on promises to jumpstart the economy of the recession-hit country, while Argentines continue to lose purchasing power to an inflation rate of more than 55 percent and about a third have been plunged under the poverty line.On the campaign trail, Macri pleaded for more time to reverse fortunes and reminds voters of the corruption cases facing Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who has denied any wrongdoing and remains a powerful if isive figure in Argentina.\u0027It\u0027s important so we don\u0027t go back to the time of the Kirchners, when there was so much robbery, so much embezzlement.

I honestly believe that by doing so they will save young lives and stop other youngsters ending up like Molly did.\u0027Mr Russell told BBC News: \u0027I think it is really important for families to discuss their internet use quite openly.\u0027It is something that shouldn\u0027t just be talked about when there are problems. It is \u0027What are you doing online? What are you finding? Which apps are you using and how are you using them?\u0027 And trying to find a way to encourage an open dialogue between parents and children.\u0027\u0027It is hard to do, but if it isn\u0027t there it might allow someone to find content and disappear into that digital rabbit hole.\u0027And then it is very difficult for a parent to know how that youngster might be being affected by what they are viewing online.\u0027Molly was a lovely daughter. We all miss her very much, but the thing perhaps she best liked doing was helping others.\u0027I think we all get comfort in knowing that, even though she is not with us any longer, she is somehow finding a way to help other youngsters remain safe and get the support and help they need if they are having mental ill-health problems.\u0027For confidential support, log on to samaritans.org or call the Samaritans on 116123."},{"url":null,"title":"Chinese twins separated babies adopted different families astonishingly similar","story":"Share this article \u0027They are laughing one minute and crying the next.

True “Janeites” tend to travel widely to celebrate their favourite author, most often to Bath for the Jane Austen festival. But on the other side of the world sits Governor’s House, a picturesque, yellow Georgian-style mansion in Hyde Park, Vermont. The house, along with its owner Suzanne Boden, draws Janeites from all over the globe – who come not only to celebrate their favourite author, but to live as a character in her world.Boden had the idea to start hosting Austen weekends at her home 11 years ago. “I was outside hanging tablecloths on the clothesline,” she says, “against the backdrop of Governor’s House, and I was listening to some music through the window, which happened to be Mozart. From the back of the house, you can’t see anything that’s modern because of the trees. And I thought: ‘I could be Jane Austen! And someone else might want to come and be Austen, too.’”Others did. For more than a decade, Boden, who also offers the occasional Downton Abbey experience, has been hosting in-character weekends where attendees – who range in age from seven to 80 – get the pleasure of living life through the eyes and words of Austen.“It’s an escape,” says Boden, who encourages guests to eschew modern technology and leave their phones behind. “It’s about going back in time. It’s a chance to dress up. Most of all, it’s a chance to be with, and interact with, other Austen fans, who always have a lot to say. It’s unusual if someone goes home without a long list of book recommendations or film recommendations from new friends.” People come for all sorts of reasons: “One woman clearly thought it was going to be like the movie Austenland and she’d meet her husband here.”Although guests don’t typically find partners at the rate Austen’s characters do, they do gain new skills: learning to write with a quill pen and fold paper the way the author did, before envelopes existed. They get English country dancing lessons and indulge in afternoon tea. No lunch is served, because, as Boden points out, lunch wasn’t invented in Austen’s time (neither was afternoon tea, but an exception is made). Other weekend activities include sewing reticules (a small purse-like bag used in Austen’s time to carry gloves, a fan, and perhaps even love notes), horse-drawn carriage rides and archery.A recent weekend dedicated to Emma at Governor’s House drew Janeites from as far away as Texas. On a Friday night, attendees nibbled lemon squares and sipped tea as they watched a short lecture titled “Bared Bosoms and Padded Calves” (on the fashions of Regency England).There are 79 regional groups in the Jane Austen Society of North America (JASNA) across the US and Canada. When asked why so many Americans love Austen, Boden is incredulous. “Everybody loves Jane Austen! She gets right to the heart of things,” she says. “On the surface, it looks like a little romance, but there are so many layers in her works, which have been translated into – well, how many languages are there in the world? Although it’s very British, she doesn’t mention anything going on politically … so it could be set anywhere.”Over a breakfast of tea, blueberry muffins and baked eggs, guests discuss favourite books, adaptations, characters – and their shared love for spotting inaccuracies in period films (“I heard there’s a shocking lack of hairpins in the new Little Women!”). Everyone agrees that Henry from Mansfield Park was one of her best male creations, for being sweet, competent and witty. “But he was never witty in a mean way, or at someone else’s expense,” says Lena Ruth Yasutake, a 36-year-old teacher from Connecticut. She runs a Regency clothing business called Cassandra’s Closet (a subtle nod to Austen) with her sister-in-law Anna, who has also joined the party: she had her hair in rag curlers yesterday night and has an Austenesque hairstyle ready for breakfast. Lena’s her devotion to Austen has been hard-won: “I pushed through my dyslexia to finish Emma because I loved the story so much. It was my ‘gateway drug’ into Austen.”The women here tend to come in groups: Vermont bookstore owner Kim Crady-Smith has brought her sister, her niece and a friend, who sit alongside three childhood friends from Dallas, all in their 70s. Ann, who urged her friends Charlene and Mary to join her, has attended other Austen weekends before, and, as a result, ended up joining the Dallas chapter of JASNA. The Dallas meetings aren’t as much fun as Boden’s weekends, Ann says: “After experiencing this, it’s hard to settle for less!”Janeites delight in Austen’s words and stories, but what most bonds the Americans is a bit more complex. Anglophilia is strong throughout the US its presence is reflected in Americans’ appetite for British television and film, football, music and more. The enthusiasm for Austen reflects a wider desire to journey into a world that feels foreign and familiar all at once.At the end of Boden’s weekends, she gives guests a quiz over Sunday brunch. Throughout the weekend, she drops hints and breadcrumbs of information that are answers to Sunday’s quiz. What happens if you fail the quiz? Boden doesn’t miss a beat: “If you flunk, you get the greatest prize of all: you get to reread the novel.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0411f83d6aa4b054300e6a3ec1c93726c0b01569/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2688054f9ad5e27b4ec5fda5f8d386a9","title":"our pet goat exploded my cramped surprising childhood in a chinese takeaway","story":"Most teenagers want to leave home to experience their first taste of independence. I just wanted to move to a place where the door didn’t go “ding” every time someone walked through it.We moved to Coventry in the early 80s, when I was just coming up to my teens and the new-romantic movement was at its peak. Back then, it was enough of a concern trying to get my hair to flick right, so when we ended up living in a Chinese takeaway I panicked about the grease wilting my fringe. Little did I know that was to be the least of my worries.My parents and grandparents had emigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1960s. They were part of a postwar wave that had begun in the 1950s, of people arriving in Britain to work in a growing industry: Chinese food. It was affordable, exotic and suddenly very popular in the west. When we arrived in Coventry, we had already lived in Nottingham and Hull, but this converted two-up two-down terrace house was where we would stay.It was only recently that I found out the majority of Hong Kong immigrants who came over to work in restaurants and takeaways did the same, as it was the cheapest and most convenient form of accommodation. The downside was that they were trapped inside the building all day, with hardly any opportunities to socialise with the wider community. It was especially difficult for people like my mother, who was essentially uneducated (she left school at 13), because it severely limited the pool of other jobs she could do. Dad’s frustration manifested as frequent bouts of short temper, and both of them turned to casinos as an escape because they were the only form of after-hours entertainment available, which is probably one of the reasons there often seem to be a lot of Chinese people in casinos. No wonder they were, and still often are, known as the “silent minority”.But, as I say, I didn’t know that then. All I knew was that the ground floor of our home was taken up by the shop and extended kitchen. We made up for not having a living room by cramming an old sofa into my parents’ bedroom, alongside a table with a TV plonked on top. I remember spending hours poring over living-room pictures in the Argos catalogue, imagining a better life involving cornicing and pelmets.My sister and I were squashed into the other bedroom, which provided the only access to the bathroom. There was absolutely no privacy, so I missed out on doing all sorts of formative stuff, such as snogging poster pinups, for fear that someone would barge in at any second, desperate for a poo.Another challenge was that, even though our kitchen was industrial-sized, we couldn’t fit in a washing machine, which meant I had to go to the launderette every weekend because Mum was too busy frying pork balls. At senior school, I heard someone say to his mate: “Ugh, I can smell soy sauce,” while they both sneered at me, so I was paranoid about cooking odours clinging to my clothes. But no matter how much detergent I chucked in, our laundry always seemed to come out with an undertone of chicken chop suey.I would have liked to talk to my parents about my troubles, but I couldn’t because my Chinese was dire. For some reason, our parents never taught us how to speak our native language (although I do understand the odd phrase, such as “Come and gut these prawns!” and “One day you’ll inherit this takeaway!”). To complicate things further, my parents, who did speak Cantonese – the dialect most British Chinese people use – chose to speak Hakka at home, so the kids couldn’t communicate at all with extended family and friends, who would ridicule us for it. Add to that the fact that Mum hardly spoke English, Dad spoke good English, but didn’t like talking, and that my grandparents spoke no English at all, and you have a pretty sorry state of affairs.Random funny fact: mashed potato never existed for Chinese people before they came to Britain, so they didn’t have a word for it. They decided to call it by its English name, “mash”, but pronounced it “ma-see”. This, translated back into Hakka, means “horse shit”, which I’ve always found hysterical because I’m so infantile.I’m not sure why Chinese people bothered naming mash because they never eat it. When our grandparents attempted to make western food, we got spaghetti with golden syrup, and margarine and sugar sandwiches. Mum never made western food, and she never let us eat the food we served customers either because she said it had no nutritional value. Instead, we ate “proper” Chinese food, which consisted of bland steamed fish and vegetables, and sometimes chicken’s feet. My views on food became so skewed that one year I thought it would be honourable of me to donate a catering tin of bamboo shoots to the harvest festival at school. It wasn’t until it was on display in assembly that I realised how out of place it looked next to the custard creams and baked beans.After-school activities included bagging prawn crackers, chopping mushrooms and peeling prawns. Contrary to the “tiger parenting” now associated with Chinese child-rearing, all my parents wanted was for me to take over the business when they retired. I know they meant well, but I couldn’t think of anything worse than working 12-hour days with only Christmas Day off. So, instead of getting a pat on the back for top marks in art, I got a slap round the head for slicing the char siu all wrong. Once, I ended up chopping the end of my index finger off with a meat cleaver, which in hindsight probably required a trip to the hospital for stitches. But my parents didn’t believe in western medicine, and they just doused the wound with soy sauce and wrapped it up in a dishcloth.When I grew tall enough, aged 14, to see over the counter – just under 5ft (FYI, I’m still that height) – I had to start serving customers, and I hated it. Friday and Saturday nights were the worst, as that was when punters came in steaming from the pub. “How long’s it gonna be?” they would slur, jabbing at their watches as if they thought I needed a visual prompt. “About this long,” I’d say, indicating the length of the container it would come in. Then they would crack up and think they’d made a funny little Asian friend. I soon learned how to deal with them, by giving as good as I got.Occasionally, a fight would break out and I’d have to call the police because I was the only one who could speak good enough English. Once, a bloke started being racist to Mum, and my uncle – who was helping out – vaulted over the counter with a knife, Bruce Lee style, and chased him down the street while the whole neighbourhood watched. But all I could think was how embarrassing my family were and how much more bullied I would be if anyone at school found out.I’d been picked on all my life, though, so it was nothing new. At infant school, I was the only Chinese kid, and bullies would pull their eyes into slits at me and sing the Ching Chong Chinaman song. I used to go home, look in the mirror and think: “But my eyes are oval-shaped,” then get confused. By the time I went to secondary school, there were three other Chinese students: my older brother, my cousin and a boy I didn’t know. Takeaways and restaurants tend to be scattered about in different towns to avoid competition. The result is that we stand out wherever we go.Despite my growing insecurities, I managed to make a friend (let’s call her Tina). Tina was interested in meeting my family, but I was insistent that this would never happen. At the same time, I wanted to appear like any other “normal” teenager who invites friends over in a “normal” way, so I caved in. She had cornrows in her hair at the time, and as soon as she walked into the kitchen, Mum pointed at her and laughed because she thought Tina looked like an onion. Tina in turn thought this was the funniest thing she’d ever heard, and in her mind it made me the coolest mate she had ever had. Good job Tina wasn’t normal either.As if running a takeaway wasn’t stressful enough, Dad decided we should keep pets. The first was a fully grown alsatian called Lucky, who seemed to appear from nowhere. We didn’t know how to train her, so she kept escaping on to the main road and nearly getting run over (not so Lucky). Finally, she was given away to the man who delivered the beansprouts. Next up were two goats that Dad gave piggybacks to, up and down the garden (he was a bit eccentric). They were doted over, and allowed to roam wherever they wanted. But one day the brown goat got caught eating £20 worth of fivers out of the till and was sent off to live with Beansprout Man as punishment. Later, the black one broke into the shed, ate a whole bag of hops and exploded. I won’t even go into what happened to my little sister’s hamster.As soon as I was able, I left home and went to London with grand ideas of becoming an artist – which, perhaps unsurprisingly, wasn’t plain sailing. It took a long time to adjust to life outside a Chinese takeaway, especially as I didn’t have a clue about boys, booze or contraception. At the age of 19, I ended up pregnant and living in a King’s Cross squat.Twenty five years later, living happily in a house with a living room – and cornicing – I was asked by my agent whether I would consider a book about my childhood. I was horrified. Then I thought about all those other first-generation British-Chinese kids who probably experienced similar things to me, who might smile with relief and think: “So I wasn’t the only one!” I know they’re out there somewhere, and now I really want to hear their versions of the story.

Hope school was OK. Are you buying that? Hope you have a lovely dinner.’ That can be an encouragement – the world is a safer place than they think. And actually that transmission of kindness shows maybe there is a possibility of communication, particularly for those who are shy or withdrawn. It’s really important that they expand their experiences to learn that while they might have had really difficult experiences, there could be other people who actually can be protective and supportive.”Talking to younger childrenGetting people, especially children, to open up, and share their feelings and thoughts can be trickier than we sometimes think. But Bush suggests that the best reason to reach children is to remember that they are people, albeit a little younger than us.“Remember, children and young people are people. The reason I say that is, we like to be spoken to in an empathetic and understanding way. Most of us prefer someone to talk to us at our own eye height.“Let’s say a six-year-old child is banging two toys together. Instead of jumping to a conclusion, try: ‘Oh, I see Superman really wants to hit Batman today, what are they fighting about?’ You never know where those kinds of questions – which start with the experience of the young person, in their world, using their metaphors – can lead to. The way into it is just by allowing the person to talk in the way they want to talk.”Listen, understand, empathiseMaking sure we’re really listening, and understanding what a person is saying to us, might sound simple, but it’s all too easy to trivialise without even realising it. “The other really important thing is not to be overly reassuring, and not to dismiss things,” says Bush.“For instance, a 21-year-old comes home and says: ‘I’m having a horrific time at work. I feel bullied, I’m failing, I feel I need to just walk away, I’m really stressed.’ Someone might reply: ‘Yeah, we all feel like that’. This kind of response is so demeaning, so dismissive. It doesn’t recognise their pain and distress.“Listen, acknowledge and be understanding. The sheer amount of people who just wanted to hear ‘Wow, that sounds really difficult. I can’t believe you’re been going through that’ as a first response … They didn’t need platitudes or complexity. They just wanted to be understood.”Connections mean resilience“There’s a lot of evidence that shows that social connectedness, a feeling of belonging – particularly connecting with people who have had similar or shared life interests or experiences – is actually very protective,” says Bush. “So young people who feel like they belong, who feel they have a sense of community, and feel able to talk to others in some way, are more resilient in the face of adversity, difficulty or mental health problems.”Britain Get TalkingTo find out more about ITV’s Britain Get Talking campaign, run in collaboration with mental health charities Mind, YoungMinds and SAMH, visit itvbritaingettalking or stv.tvbritaingettalking"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8241f26a7215828bb9ceaff18e38c7db567f0836/304_1083_3272_1963/master/3272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=374b5b2cadeae7836b2b660aa3d3bf2a","title":"from would you rather to desert island books 10 conversation starters for children and teenagers","story":"Whether you’re hoping to raise a laugh or build a deeper connection, these 10 open-ended questions can help get the conversation started – because it’s good talkNothing kills a conversation faster than the death knell of a generic question.

Kids particularly love grim options, such as “Would you rather be covered in fur or covered in scales?” Or “Would you rather be pelted with fish guts or horse poo?” These types of questions are a great way of winning over even the shyest of children.If you could go back in a time machine, where would you go and what would you do?You might want to change the course of political history, head into the distant past to see how the pyramids were really built, or check out a T-Rex in the flesh. The possibilities are fascinating and endless.Which super power would you have and why?Of course the answer is the power of flight. Or is it invisibility? Or teleportation? Or the ability to read minds – which would be terribly helpful to cat owners. Or would it be to have arms that can turn into giant crab pincers?Of course, there are times to have fun and times to try to reach out to those around you in a more considered way. It may be that your child has been unusually withdrawn, or that you’re aware that something isn’t right but haven’t been able to find the right words to open up a discussion with them. Here are a few options to try.How would you describe yourself in five words?This question can be a great way in for understanding how a person is feeling about themselves, and if they’re in a good place or having a hard time . Positive responses usually mean a positive outlook, while negative answers can help you glean a deeper understanding of what they’re struggling with.Tell me three things about your dayUnlike the classic “how was your day?” this question shows you have a real interest in the answer, and will prompt a more detailed, considered response that could potentially spark an important conversation. What was the hardest part of your day, and why?This might prove tricky to answer, but it can be a really useful question to ask if you feel that your child is in some kind of distress. By helping them pinpoint the most difficult part of their day, you might be able to unlock a broader discussion about how they’re feeling, and why.What are you thankful for today, and why?It may seem counterintuitive – especially if you’re in a hard place – but gratitude exercises can play an important role in improving mental wellbeing. Helping your child to pinpoint things they are thankful for every day, even if it’s just one or two small things, can help them lift their mood and gain some perspective.Is there anything that you need from me? Space, time to talk, time to do something fun? …Even if you manage to get them to open up, as a parent or carer, it can sometimes be hard to know how to best support a child or teenager who is having a hard time. If you find yourself in that situation, one of the best things you can do is ask them outright. This clear, open conversation starter even gives them some possible options for how to respond.And one last thing … These suggestions are all here to help you break the ice, possibly start a debate or score a laugh, but most importantly, connect on a deeper level.

Over a year it is estimated that this could save 5 tonnes of plastic.Stephen Cawley, the head of sustainability at John Lewis said: “Our customers have told us they want us to help them reduce their impact on the planet and that reducing and recycling packaging is key for them. Our message that we want customers to take away just the product that they love and reduce and reuse the packaging that they don’t, will be clearly communicated throughout the shop.”As concern grows about the effect of single-use plastic on the environment, manufacturers and retailers have begun to tackle their substantial carbon footprints. Last month Sainsbury’s said selling milk and fizzy drinks in returnable glass bottles was an option, while Tesco will ban brands that use excessive packaging from its stores from next year.In other measures introduced at John Lewis’s Oxford store, recyclable eco-wrap is being substituted for bubble wrap for china and glass products. Customers can also bring back hangers – from any retailer or brand – to be reused or recycled.The shop will also reward My John Lewis membership cardholders who return empty beauty product packaging and used clothing with gift vouchers. The so-called BeautyCycle scheme, which was tested earlier this year, is being permanently introduced this week to 36 John Lewis shops with a beauty department. Customers booking home delivery for larger items will be offered the chance to help reduce carbon emissions by selecting an “eco-delivery” slot when a van would be close to their home.The trial will continue into next year and the retailer will evaluate customer feedback before deciding whether to roll it out. It has 50 shops across the UK (36 department stores, 12 John Lewis at home and shops at St Pancras station in London and Heathrow’s Terminal 2) as well as online shop johnlewis.The chain has taken a leaf out of the book of its sister retailer Waitrose – also part of the John Lewis Partnership – in choosing Oxford as a testbed.In June Waitrose launched a trial of its Unpacked system at the local Botley Road store to gauge shoppers’ reactions to packaging-free food and drink options including the use of refills, a concept that is being scrutinised by its competitors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be295620d28540634520bf1a6515e641b7a4dccc/231_550_6671_4002/master/6671.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=582cd80b8494a543923a530f36467fe5","title":"meet the councils quietly building a housing revolution","story":"The Stirling prize-winning Norwich estate is the tip of the iceberg: despite government cuts, local authorities are finding innovative ways to build housingA crescent of semi-detached houses stands on the edge of a playing field in Conisbrough, South Yorkshire, offering views of the rolling hills beyond. With pointed gables, big picture windows and generous back gardens dotted with trampolines, it looks like a development of aspirational “executive homes”, awaiting its gilded electric gates and four-wheel-drives.“We had people coming along trying to buy them when the hoardings came down,” says Charlotte Johnson, housing manager at Doncaster Council. They had to turn the crowds away – because these are council houses, some of the first built here for a generation. It is just one example of what many local authorities are now managing to achieve up and down the country, against the odds, after decades of central government inaction. Last week, the award for the best new building in the UK went to Goldsmith Street in Norwich, another exemplary development of council homes, marking the first time the hallowed RIBA Stirling prize has been given to social housing. The award sends a powerful message: despite government cuts, a number of bold councils are getting on and doing it for themselves.“Local authorities are doing a lot more to build housing than we generally think,” says Dr Janice Morphet, public sector planning veteran and visiting professor at University College London, who has been conducting detailed research into the different methods that councils are using to deliver homes in the absence of government grants . “Our findings suggest that around 13,000 homes were built by councils last year. Sure, it’s not the 300,000 we need, but it indicates the beginning of a slow and gentle revolution.”The 40 homes in the Conisbrough development are some of the 400-plus that Doncaster council has been building over the last few years, since the Labour council came to power in 2013, following the previous administration’s catastrophic legacy of mismanagement. It helps that the mayor, Ros Jones , is a former public sector accountant with a keen eye for detail, and that the council appointed one of those rare species: an in-house architect.“We’ve taken a similar approach to a speculative house builder, except we’re cutting out the profit,” says Matthew Clarkson, the New Zealander architect behind the new homes. “We realised that if we developed a series of standard house types, we could offer the economies of scale that a house builder would. But we’ve got more generous space standards and a higher quality specification to keep our long-term maintenance costs down.”Walking through the development, he points out numerous thoughtful details, from the deep welcoming porches with corner kitchen windows, so you feel connected to the street and can see who’s coming in, to future-proofed aspects, like convertible attics and extra large ground-floor loos that can fit a shower if needed, to the neat bin stores with planted tops. The black brick houses even have matching black mortar, giving them a sleek, monolithic feel. These are all features that few volume house builders would dream of shelling out for. “It’s not trying to be show-stopping architecture,” says Clarkson. “It’s comfortable, durable housing that fits with its surroundings.”Jason Hulme recently moved into one of the new homes with his three-year-old daughter and he can’t believe his luck. “It’s twice the size of my old private-rented place,” he says, standing in the living room where big sliding glass doors lead out to the garden, “and it’s so much lighter and warmer too.”Morphet’s research, conducted with colleague Dr Ben Clifford and funded by the Royal Town Planning Institute, shows that Doncaster and Norwich are not alone. From Bristol and Bournemouth to Wigan and Wolverhampton, their findings paint a picture of local authorities taking an interventionist approach and using a wide range of powers to deliver homes through a variety of means.It’s partly because they have no choice. While half of all local authorities no longer own council housing (having transferred their stock to housing associations long ago), the 2017 Homelessness Reduction Act imposed a legal duty on all councils to prevent and relieve homelessness. Given the scale and severity of the housing crisis – from employers struggling to recruit priced-out local workers, to the fact that homelessness has doubled in the last five years – there is growing public expectation for councils of all political shades to intervene.“We were interested to find that it’s not just Labour councils that are engaging with housing, nor is there an urban-rural ide,” says Morphet. “Some of the Conservative councils are more angry with the government than Labour.” Conservative-controlled Bournemouth, Lewes, Canterbury, South Norfolk, North Kesteven and Newark and Sherwood all cropped up in their survey as having active housing programmes, as did Lib Dem-controlled Eastbourne and Eastleigh.So how are they going about it? In the absence of central government grants, local authorities have been forced to be more creative in exploiting the various powers at their disposal. In the early 1990s, grants covered around three-quarters of the costs of building new sub-market homes, but this fell dramatically after the 2008 financial crisis. Under David Cameron and George Osborne, the 2011-15 Affordable Homes Programme gave no grant to social housing at all. There were high hopes when Theresa May scrapped the borrowing cap in 2018, which had previously constrained the amount that councils could borrow to build housing. But her triumphant rhetoric conveniently ignored the fact that fewer than half of all councils actually have any housing stock to borrow against – and those that do are very cautious, knowing that any new homes they do build would be subject to the right to buy policy. Last week the government imposed a shock rise in interest on cheap Treasury loans, further scuppering many councils’ carefully laid plans.“It’s been very difficult for councils to build proper social housing because government subsidy has vanished,” says Morphet. “So they’ve looked at all these other models to compensate for the fact they haven’t been able to do what they need to do. Councils have always had a large set of property powers, but they haven’t really thought of using them to build housing until now.” Desperate times call for desperate measures.She cites the 1963 Local Authorities Land Act, which gave councils the power to develop land the 2000 Local Government Act, which gave them the power to do anything that promotes the “wellbeing” of their communities and the 2011 Localism Act, which bestowed the “general power of competence”, giving councils the legal power to do anything a private inidual can do. None of these were housing acts per se, but their ramifications for housing have been significant, allowing local authorities to behave in a more entrepreneurial way.The results are wide-ranging. Bournemouth is building housing above many of its surface car parks, and has won planning awards for the results. Wigan is transforming tricky former mining sites with an exemplary programme of housing for older people. Exeter has one of Europe’s largest Passivhaus schemes underway, while Liverpool is developing rent-to-buy homes. Spelthorne was faced with a problematic pub-turned-strip-club in the green belt, so it decided to buy it and convert it into flats. Plymouth is building council housing for homeless veterans, involving the future residents in construction to help with their adjustment back to civilian life. They receive certificates in carpentry, plastering, bricklaying and management of site safety, making them more employable by the end of the project. The list of local innovations goes on.Colm Lacey, director of Brick by Brick, describes the company model as “a deliberate attempt to pull apart the development system and repackage the inidual elements so the council benefits”. The company borrows money from the council at commercial rates, so the interest goes back to the public purse, not a bank. “Nowhere along the way does money leak out to the private sector,” he says. Their planned developments have about three times the amount of affordable housing than schemes previously built in the borough, providing useful precedents for the council’s planners to demand these sorts of numbers from other developers.As Paul Smith puts it: “Our company allows us to set an example for other house builders, because it’s operating in a commercial way. Developers might claim they can’t provide social housing and low-energy features, but we’re showing that you can, and still make a profit.”A slightly different tactic is being used in Nottingham, where the council’s development company, Blueprint, has been building high-spec housing for sale to kickstart private-sector investment in a waterside regeneration zone. “Before we started building here, no developers were interested,” says Nottingham council’s head of regeneration and housing delivery, Mark Lowe. “Since the Blueprint schemes at Trent Basin, a whole range of sites have come forward, stimulating this new area of the city.”Waterside regeneration is one thing, but the pressing need is for more council homes. Nottingham has around 8,500 people on its housing waiting list, a figure that has doubled in the last four years. The council has been trying to keep up, building almost 600 affordable homes through its arms-length management organisation, Nottingham City Homes, with projects like the Lenton Green estate. Here, smart new low-energy brick houses with rooftop solar panels have replaced ailing 1960s towers, but it’s not nearly enough to keep up with the number of council flats being lost through the right to buy. Last year the city lost 436 homes this way, more than one a day.“It’s economic madness,” says Paul Smith. “Imagine building properties then selling them for less than you built them for. What kind of business is that? We’ve got 12,000 households on the waiting list in Bristol and 500 families in temporary accommodation. Why would you sell off the resource, at a cut price, that you desperately need more of?”Speaking to local authorities up and down the country, the right to buy recurs again and again as the biggest obstacle to delivering more council homes. In Rotherham, which is currently building 340 new homes, with 200 more set to start next year, housing manager Tom Bell is frank. “We used to have 40,000 council houses,” he says. “Now it’s around 20,500. We’re losing up to 200 homes a year. It’s incredibly damaging because you lose your best properties and your most stable tenants. It can change the dynamic of a place very quickly.”“The simple fact is we need more subsidy,” says Paul Smith. “The last 100 years of council estates was built on public subsidy, and it pays itself back. We’ve estimated a 30-year payback time, but it’s probably quicker. Every time we build more housing, it improves the finances of our business plan, because the new homes have lower repair costs. It’s financially positive for our budget to build more housing.”It is a message that Westminster must wake up to. Local authorities are ready, willing and eminently capable of building the next generation of high quality council housing. Many are already finding ways to do it, despite the constraints. They just need to have their full potentials unleashed.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b8d097055c2211d923752ab7d62007fbad0d2a0/0_33_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c1ccfd81a9374b24f6bf2b903f447a4","title":"peoples vote labour brexit second referendum","story":"This week, Boris Johnson breaks his “die in a ditch” pledge to leave the EU on Thursday, and parliament is voting on whether to hold a general election. It is, then, next-level strategic genius to choose this moment to implode the People’s Vote campaign. Roland Rudd, who when he’s not doing PR for financial firms moonlights as chairman of Open Britain – one of the organisations that makes up People’s Vote – has led moves to sack the campaign’s director, James McGrory, and its head of communications, ex-Labour adviser Tom Baldwin. Blood is being spilt, and very publicly: staff have staged a mass walkout, Rudd’s faction is threatening to prosecute McGrory and Baldwin for trespassing, and both sides are fighting it out on Sky News while claiming everything is fine.Here is a salutary lesson that should have been heeded long ago. During the referendum, the official remain outfit – Britain Stronger In Europe – waged a corporate-backed campaign that lacked any appeal to the electorate. To borrow an expression, they brought a calculator to a knife fight. They could have learned from this lesson. They clearly have not.If you wanted a personification of everything people resent about the establishment, Rudd is not a bad person to start with. A multimillionaire who has been repeatedly voted as one of Britain’s most influential financial PR executives, he is also the brother of Tory politician Amber Rudd and is deeply embedded in the country’s elite networks. Peter Mandelson is godfather to one of his children and he was an unofficial adviser to Tony Blair, whose son did work experience at Rudd’s firm while he was prime minister. And herein lies the problem that has bedevilled the People’s Vote campaign from the start: for some of the campaign’s protagonists this has always been about winning back power. There have, of course, always been passionate remainers who genuinely believe Brexit is a terrible self-inflicted disaster that will make their country poorer. And there are others who might also believe this, but who certainly did see remain as a useful means of undermining the Labour leadership and driving a wedge between it and its members and voters. One People’s Vote insider tells me “there was a real Labour-hating atmosphere” at the start, and that Baldwin’s arrival in the summer of 2018 made a difference in challenging that. “When some of us pointed out, ‘You’re not going to win this without Labour,’” they tell me, “the answer was always, ‘You would say that, you’re a Labour supporter.’”In part, People’s Vote became a refuge and a means to regain relevance for those exiled from frontline politics by Jeremy Corbyn’s assumption of the Labour leadership. The picture painted to me by insiders is one of huge egos with no accountability.In an increasingly likely December election, they would like to use the People’s Vote apparatus principally to aid the efforts of the Liberal Democrats who – ironically – have abandoned a second referendum in favour of revoking article 50. Another suspicion put to me is that choosing such a critical week to defenestrate the People’s Vote leadership is about abandoning the cause of stopping Brexit in favour of a “rejoin” campaign once Britain has left. This would be the clearest case yet of some using the campaign as a political entity that is less about democracy (a final say now we know more about the nature of Brexit) and more as a vehicle for centrism now the Labour party has been lost to Corbyn. Hundreds of thousands have sacrificed their free time to march and campaign against Brexit. People’s Vote has many dedicated staff who truly believe in their cause. Of course, Labour still has a case to answer: it should have pivoted earlier than it did to back a new referendum. But Britain’s remainers have been ill-served by self-interested, elite power players who always had other motives. They have helped crater Labour’s support, contributing to a ision in the anti-Tory vote which may yet hand Johnson the majority he craves, but has not – as you may have noticed – stopped Brexit in its path.And if Labour forms a government after an election – the only plausible route to the referendum the People’s Vote campaign exists to promote – and if this faction is central to the remain campaign, we might as well skip the hassle and declare defeat in advance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e012ecd4ed6d90775815f04c292b13d0d1fafe6d/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ece3e9171308deb5252f5ec2633600","title":"polls labour win general election","story":"The party should frame this campaign as a choice between more of the same and a new start, with hope of national renewalToday, Labour MPs will decide whether the country will head to the polls in December. Many are hostile towards the idea, fearing that they are facing an electoral wipeout. Instead, they cling to the prospect of securing a second referendum as an alternative means to stopping Brexit. With the polls where they are, it is understandable that Labour MPs are fearful of facing the electorate.But this election could be far closer than is commonly imagined. The ascendancy of the SNP in Scotland, the rise of the Liberal Democrats in England, and the schism between the Tories and the DUP means that there are fewer seats in play for the major parties. Labour and the Conservatives must compete for around 540 seats with no viable coalition partners, the Tories must secure 322 seats for a majority of one. For that to occur, Labour must get no more than 218 seats – far below either its performance in either 2015 or 2017 (232 and 262 seats respectively). Conversely, if Labour can defend its current seats, it would enable an anti-Tory majority to be formed.Strategically, Labour approaches a general election with three major advantages.The first is that the deal Johnson has negotiated is truly awful for the country, leaving Britain substantially poorer according to the government’s own figures. The second is that the Tories have the record of their 10 years in power to defend – a decade during which public services and benefits have been cut, wages have stagnated and living standards have been squeezed – alongside Brexit chaos: a winter election highlights these issues, from the rise in concern about homelessness during the Christmas period to the likely winter crisis in the NHS as a result of systematic underfunding. Third, polling shows that Johnson is disliked by large parts of the electorate, and many people might be prepared to vote tactically to keep the party they dislike out of office. This opens up the route to at least some informal electoral pact between the anti-Tory parties – perhaps a loose agreement not to campaign in certain seats.Absent a settled strategy, Labour languishes behind in the polls. Its MPs focus their interventions on questions of parliamentary process and election timing rather than critiquing Johnson’s plans or articulating Labour’s policies. When politicians talk about their own priorities, not those of the voters, it should be little surprise that they are not rewarded by the electorate. This can and must change. So what would a more effective strategy look like?The public need to want to fire the Tories before deciding that they wish to hire Labour. It would be a serious error to think that Brexit can be ignored by simply talking about other issues. At the time of the 2017 poll, the chaos and perpetual crisis of the following two-and-a-half years was unimaginable. The mistake that Theresa May made was to call a general election after article 50 notification had taken place this meant most voters thought that Brexit had been sorted and that it was only a matter of time before Britain would leave the EU. No one thinks that now. Brexit will be front and centre in this election no matter how much some might wish it away.In any election, the public either want change or more of the same. In 2017, the Tory message of “strong and stable leadership” sounded like an appeal for continuity and so in what became a change election, they paid the price. Labour needs to present this campaign as a choice between more of the same with the Tories or a new start with Labour.That’s why the first phase of the Labour campaign should be to demonstrate how each strand of Johnson’s deal represents continuity with a decade of Tory austerity and misrule, heaping disaster on dismay. After 10 years of NHS cuts, the Tories now want to sell off the NHS to private corporations. After a decade without a real pay rise, the Tories plan is to strip away workers’ rights for a deal with Trump’s America where there’s no maternity pay, no sick pay, 10 days’ holiday and the ability for bosses to fire people on the spot for no reason. After a decade of putting the bankers first, their sell-out deal will mean the end of decent manufacturing jobs as the price of avoiding banking regulations. A vote for Johnson is a vote for more of the same. And to make matters worse, Johnson’s Brexit plan still includes a trapdoor to a no-deal disaster. The only way to stop a prime minister committed to a no-deal exit from the EU is to fight and win a general election that removes him from office.Next, Labour has to make, and win, the argument for a second referendum. Its message – “let the people decide” – has failed to cut through precisely because its strongest remain voices on the backbenches have focused more on timing and tactics than on bothering to prosecute the argument. More than that, the message sounds like one of exasperation: that Labour is incapable of making its own mind up, so it has outsourced the responsibility to the public. Instead, Labour needs to make a deeper argument about the kind of country we want to be: this could be extended beyond Brexit into an agenda for economic democracy and more public participation in decision-making.Labour also needs to offer the country an alternative project of national renewal. With a plan to settle Brexit for good, Labour should then offer to rebuild Britain instead. It can frame this as a 1945 moment: the chance to shape a new settlement for the decades ahead. That means a manifesto bursting with good ideas to improve the state of country and fundamental reform of the status quo. But it also needs to show how change can be meaningful: that will require translating big, bold, national policy commitments into what they could mean for every part of Britain. From the national transformation fund to the green industrial revolution, Labour has been willing to think big about the future of the country: it now has an urgent task to think small about what it might mean for each community and every household.Finally, Labour should ignore the idea of extending the franchise to 16-year-olds, which will be viewed as the naked pursuit of self-interest. It should instead argue that every voter must be offered a postal vote, given the hours of daylight and the potential for bad weather on polling day. All the evidence shows that electoral fraud is virtually non-existent and that postal voting increases participation, especially from those groups in society that are marginalised or vulnerable. Let the Tories explain why they want to inconvenience people during the cold winter months.There can be no doubt that Labour has an electoral mountain to climb. But there are reasons to believe that it can do so in this election of generational significance. The country cannot afford and should not expect anything less.• Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economics.

You could say that every result bar Wavertree delivered surprises, though it would depend on how easily you are surprised.In Bassetlaw, Sally Gimson beat candidates backed by Unite and Momentum, all the more unusual given that she’s a remainer in a leave area and not considered dyed-in-the-wool local. In Nottingham East, Nadia Whittome, an Another Europe is Possible activist, won with Unison and Aslef support.Susan Dungworth won Blyth Valley against the candidate with overwhelming union and high-command support. Poplar and Limehouse was a battle between two Momentum figures, won by Apsana Begum. Ross Houston took Finchley and Golders Green, though whether it was as the staunchest remainer or the truest local that he beat the Momentum candidate is unclear. Rebecca Gordon-Nesbitt and Emma Corlett have been selected in South Thanet and North Norfolk respectively, though any Labour candidate will have a mountain to climb in those seats.You could probably read in all these runes some message about Labour members and their remain sympathies. But in this context, remain versus lexit is no more than a contemporary gloss over a tug-of-war that has existed for ever between the local, constituency Labour parties (CLPs) and Labour HQ. If the leader’s office were to stay neutral and let the CLP decide, they would not only be relinquishing their control of the party’s composition, they would also be giving up their leverage with major unions, whose support is implicitly repaid with candidates of their own.During the Blair years it would be rare for a candidate simply to be announced from on high. Rather, the party’s national executive committee would rig the shortlist and tip the hustings, so that by the time members arrived at the selection meeting, the chair would already have taken a call from the leader, explaining how beneficial it was for a certain candidate to be selected. The process was artificial to an embarrassing degree.The selection system is founded on the basis that an MP is both local, ergo representative, and passionately, demonstrably loyal to the party, ergo the cream of the crop. So you’d have a man who’d been a Conservative until five minutes ago, or a Labour staffer whose connection to Stoke-on-Trent was that he could point to it on a map, performing laughable stances of ardent connection to the people of the area. Nobody liked it very much, but while the party was flying it didn’t seem to dent its vote share.That power struggle hasn’t changed – how could it? But its execution today is very different, and its results are a lot less predictable. So, in Vauxhall on Sunday, roughly 400 members – including myself – turned up to a further education college in Clapham, south London, to choose between Katy Clark, the Unite candidate Ibrahim Doğuş, the choice of the leader’s office Stephen Beer, from Christians on the Left Florence Eshalomi, her own candidate and Claire Holland, the centrist’s choice.Bear in mind that this constituency has had the painful experience of Kate Hoey as MP for 30 years, who is more Brexit party than Labour – and not just on Brexit itself, but in her entire sensibility. Only the power struggle within the membership – between a strong centre and a strong left, both sides too anxious that the other would prevail – protected her from being triggered decades ago. So there was a genuine air of hope and enthusiasm, a mood perhaps more united than in the other selections, since it was genuinely impossible to imagine anyone worse.The NEC had explicitly rejected the local party’s expectation of an all-women shortlist, burning an awful lot of goodwill and losing a few solid candidates (Emily Wallace, Laura Parker) in the process, which can only have been to clear the way for a man. That man must have been Doğuş, because he sure as hell wasn’t Beer, who came over like a Tony Blair tribute act at a really eccentric wedding. However, this message had not percolated down very well many Corbyn loyalists just assumed Clark was the leader’s candidate.Each candidate did a stump speech, then was asked five identical questions: one on housing, to which they all delivered more or less the same supply-side fetish (“build more houses!”). There was one on science, which must have been intended to raise climate change, but actually yielded some bizarre perorations on robots and sexism and China. One on student fees and debt, in which most toed the party line. One on knife crime, and finally, a really contorted question on abortion, which can only have been to smoke out the faith element to see if it would be a problem down the line (Beer is Methodist, Eshalomi is Catholic).Eshalomi shone as a human being: on any question related to people, she gave the real impression of having met some and thought about their predicament. She didn’t win outright on the first preference, but even those who understood and stuck to their faction (emphatically not everyone) had her as a second choice, which took her comfortably over the line.The moral of these selections is that, if you want to stitch up a seat, you have to do it right. Any trace of bafflement leaves it all to the chemistry of the room, that perilous possibility that members might just vote for who they like the most. Who’s to say that the candidate whom members like, voters won’t like also? Perhaps it will play havoc with party unity down the line. But perhaps party unity is very last century."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0f8385e421753efcece36d2c66a6785a9bc921/0_127_4612_2767/master/4612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71500187cb82888907dbe4bc03baa38e","title":"guardian editors climate emergency pledge","story":"Editors from across the  explain how they are putting the climate emergency front and centreThe climate crisis is a story that reaches every corner of the world and on the international news desk our team of correspondents report on it from around the globe.For many readers, it is something they experience to varying degrees of intensity at first hand – a hotter summer, an earlier spring, floods in autumn – but by linking up those experiences, we are able to show how interconnected this crisis is.In the past few months we have covered stories ranging from the record-breaking European heatwave, where temperatures of over 45C were recorded in France for the first time, a heatwave and drought in India, where thousands abandoned their homes, and the unprecedented Arctic wildfires that could be seen from space.Such events are not just “weather”, however, and we follow their impact: the buckling European road and rail infrastructure not suitable for the new climate era, the desperate search for water in Chennai and the Greenland residents traumatised by the climate emergency as life becomes more precarious and social problems such as alcoholism intensify.In Italy, the Planpincieux glacier in the Mont Blanc massif is changing so rapidly that avalanches and debris falls have led to deaths and evacuations, leaving residents in the town of Courmayeur fearing how much longer it will hold.Our reporters have also travelled to where governments and iniduals are making it worse. Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a 2,000km journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation.There are also those attempting to make it better. On 1 September 2018 we published an interview from Stockholm with a 15-year-old who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden’s hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg’s solo protest has since become a global movement.Climate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. “I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,” subsistence farmer Esteban Gutiérrez told reporter Nina Lakhani.Business and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world – and are key to meeting the Paris agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.From giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers – all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment.These are huge questions, and  readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like.Our economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth – which does not pursue profit at all costs – must come.We are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives – and alerting readers to those who fall short.Writing in the  earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France – Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau – underlined the importance of change. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said.Without action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year’s Californian wildfires, for instance – the worst in the state’s history – cost insurers more than $12bn. Banks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become “stranded assets”. The Bank of England has warned that as much as $20tn of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed.Many companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L’Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress.We are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year, and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer.Our reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting 100,000 electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK.Most corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines – like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next 20 years.Investment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal \u0026amp General, Europe’s second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year: “The effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients’ assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.”However, not every investment group is using its muscle – and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager, with $6tn under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock’s job is to make a profit for investors. He added: “Our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter.”They do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting.Fashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the mostimportant issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage.We aren’t perfect and we don’t pretend to have all the answers. Wewill continue to listen to a wide range of voices – our readersparamount amongst those – to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion – in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background.We have always championed ethical fashion brands, but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn’t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic – but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet.What does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintagepieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe, and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it.None of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion – and about the future of our planet, too.There’s an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it’s clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have.Meat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public’s focus. There are many reasons why veganism – or at least flexitarianism – is growing fast and sustainability is one of them.It’s important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, ided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together – families, friends, communities and strangers – and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It’s also a time when it’s difficult to know who to believe and to trust. I hope people can be sure of the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe269d9ec06740a551d25fa8d8e07c902892cd2/0_260_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d6b0d86d0b03a66ff9f5ee4bdec8e2","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 images pictures guidelines","story":" picture editor Fiona Shields explains why we are going to be using fewer polar bears and more people to illustrate our coverage of the climate emergency At the  we want to ensure that the images we publish accurately and appropriately convey the climate crisis that we face. Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c360b6db88dd12f0f8eafa47bba9c28f98bf0c38/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=393fa324178e44eddef16bb0d0466dbf","title":"the guardians climate pledge 2019","story":"We want the  to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe.

Before you roll your eyes at what probably sounds like heavyweight food-writer virtue signalling, I should admit that it is, but not only. My wish to have a 3kg book spreadeagled at all times is because, yes, it is the best food reference ever to appear in the English language – a 900-page A-Z looking at a multiplicity of foodstuffs, also food literature, science, history and food habits from all over the world – but also because it is a delightful book.It’s a serious work, astonishing in its breadth and detail, but it doesn’t take itself too seriously. This is thanks to Davidson, the mastermind of this companionable matrix and author of a vast number of the entries. He is a brilliant writer – sharp, exacting, graceful – but also a humorous one. In a revised edition of the companion, Tom Jaine describes the impish humour that pervades Davidson’s work: the paradox of pink blancmange, Goan food-ways, why the London stock exchange is like gorgonzola, how oncom is fermented in Indonesia, why Chinese mooncakes caused a revolution – every entry, even the most detailed and dense, seems to wriggle with the delight of it all.Not having a huge walnut desk, I need to pull the 3kg from its position wedged between my little desk and the kitchen cupboard every time I need it, which is often. Today, it’s for cottage pie, a savoury dish of minced beef (traditionally from leftover roast, but also fresh mince) topped with mashed potato, which, like its twin, shepherd’s pie, “conjures up visions of shepherds long ago eating this simple fare, but the name does not seem to have been used until the 1870s when mincing machines were first used”. The entry goes on to quote Jane Grigson and how, with the first mincing machines, “prisons, schools, and seaside boarding-house cooks acquired a new weapon to distress their victims”. Happily, I have never been distressed by cottage pie: I have always enjoyed the delicious, easy and inexpensive versions the entry goes on to describe, even at school, when it was often followed by steamed pudding with pink custard, which I loved without even a spoonful of irony.So to the recipe – one that belongs to my family life.While the heavyweight was out, I looked up the ingredients in today’s recipe: the journey of carrots from Afghanistan to Europe in the middle ages how wild celery from temperate Europe and Asia was tamed and cultivated the etymology of onion. Another great thing about this book is how it continually reminds us of the evolution of ingredients in the hands of global gardeners, as Massimo Montanari writes: “Ingredients and alimentary traditions change with time, becoming modified as they come into contact with other traditions.”I am British and European, so it feels right that, for this British produce issue (and what brilliant British produce there is), I have made a recipe from my English childhood, with ingredients bought and cooked at home, in Rome.The most important part of the recipe is roughing up the surface with a fork, which I am now going to refer to as gadrooning.100g rindless streaky bacon3 tbsp lard, dripping, butter or other suitable fat for frying1 onion, peeled and diced1 small leek, trimmed and diced1 carrot, peeled and diced2 sticks of celery, diced1 bay leafSalt and pepper400g minced beef1 tsp Marmite (optional)300ml light stock1kg potatoes, peeledButterWhole milkIn a heavy-based pan over a medium low heat, gently fry the bacon in the fat.

Add the Marmite (if using) and pour over the stock. Leave to simmer for an hour, by which point it should be rich and thick with just a little liquid.Meanwhile, boil the potatoes in well-salted water until tender. Drain, then mash with butter and milk, seasoning to taste.Put the mince in the bottom of a Pyrex or porcelain oven-proof dish, then spoon over the mash and fork it into place, creating rough peaks on the top.Bake on the top shelf of an oven heated to 190C (170C fan)gas 5 for 25 minutes, until the edges are bobbing and the top is golden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a75082955b937fa9366cc04adc7250306625a9b/0_37_5730_3438/master/5730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e5be4272bc3ab47d807578534ac280b","title":"share your worst halloween pumpkin carvings","story":"We’d like to see your worst Halloween pumpkin carvings and find out what happened to them.

Put in a steamer and cook for about 25 minutes, until tender to the point of a sharp knife. Remove the pan from heat and leave the squash uncovered to steam-dry.To make the caramel, put the sugar in a heavy-based pan and pour over four tablespoons of water. Set over a medium heat and keep an eye on it as the sugar melts and turns a deep, dark caramel colour, and the water evaporates. Just before it starts smoking, quickly add the butter, cream and rum, and stir vigorously until you have a smooth, silky caramel.Put 350g squash flesh into a bowl, pour over the caramel and . Use a stick blender to whizz until you have a smooth sauce.

Add one to two tablespoons of the butter and, once hot, fry one to two slices of the bread at a time, turning once the bottom is golden – three to four minutes. Set aside on a warm plate and repeat until all the toast is done. Dollop over scoops of the pumpkin caramel, season with a scrunch of sea salt, then serve with vanilla ice-cream, thick cream or Greek yoghurt.There is usually some leftover puree, so stir it through Greek yoghurt for breakfast with a touch of granola.

But when one woman called last week to ask where the team trained, he couldn’t give an exact answer. “I said to her: I’ll ring you back next week and let you know where we’re playing, because we’re struggling to find places to play.’”Lowe’s problem is one affecting grassroots women’s football teams across the country. The number of girls and women taking up the sport has skyrocketed since the Women’s World Cup, with 605 new girls’ youth teams and 260 new women’s clubs registered to play this season. But grassroots teams say the lack of affordable and accessible pitches has made it a struggle to establish themselves or grow to meet increasing demand.Last year, Lowe, the 49-year-old chairman and coach of Longford Park, invited mothers who were standing on the sidelines and cheering their children on to try out for a women’s team. Word and enthusiasm for the new team quickly spread and Longford Park Ladies now have 40 players. While it was relatively easy to find players, finding a space for the team to train has been a nightmare.Lowe said teams such as his have to settle for playing on hockey pitches for matches and training, much to his dismay. “There’s no control with the football … And when it rains, you haven’t got a chance. There’s no point in being there. It’s daft. It’s not football is it?” he said.Naomi Short, 41, who helps coach a girls’ team and set up a women’s team in Trafford, said the only slot the team could train on the local pitch was between 9.15pm and 10.15pm on a weeknight because more established teams block-book pitch space for weeks at a time. “I’ve played football since I was five years old and there is so much more available today than there was then, but the pitches do get booked out far too quickly and we have a lot of mums on our team who can’t train at odd hours,” she said. Eventually, she joined Longfield Park Ladies. Goal Diggers, one of London’s biggest grassroots football teams open to women and non-binary players, said they have to cap training at a local school to 60 players and spaces can go within minutes. Fleur Cousens, who founded the team four years ago, said she has been looking for bigger pitch space in Hackney and Islington for three years, but the search has become more desperate over the past few months.“Every night of the week there’s a men’s 11-a-side league that dominates those spaces and that’s 22 men using it,” Cousens said. “I think the fact the space is only being used by men needs to change … it makes it seem those spaces are masculine.”Ian Bruce, the chairman of AFC Stoke Newington in north London, said in general there were not enough green spaces to play football, affecting new girls’ and boys’ teams as well as disability teams. “It’s a huge problem in a city like London and we need to start asking how to better distribute pieces of land that can be used to better serve the community,” he said.Cousens accepts that while the booking systems are not trying to be discriminatory, they have to account for the fact that from 1921 to 1971, women were banned from playing on Football Association pitches and have long been widely discouraged from taking part in the sport. “We’re playing catch-up on space that has been taken by men,” she said.She called on councils to implement fundamental changes to their booking systems for pitch space, such as having one night in the week that is only open to women’s groups. As for the FA, a spokesperson said it was aware of issues relating to pitch allocation and was working with the Football Foundation “to deliver approximately 400 new pitches over the next three years”.Despite the difficulties of getting on a pitch, Christina Philippou, 37, a university lecturer, said she had been taken aback by the interest in the local women’s football team she set up in Guildford, Surrey. “Despite the fact it’s a pretty crap slot, training on a Sunday evening, it’s been amazing how many people continue to turn up. I’ve been really surprised by the demand, but there seems to be a gap in the market there,” she said.Nicky Ellison, an adult careers adviser, said the lack of pitch space meant she had an uphill battle in developing women’s football in Bournemouth, Dorset. “I’m going to have to start my own five-a-side league, but before we even get to that point, just training on a normal pitch is impossible,” she said. The team she set up plays at the local YMCA and though the facilities are not big enough, it is all they can afford.Ellison is determined to set up an accessible and affordable league despite the challenges, saying that she has seen women transform through playing with the team. “I think sometimes women focus on their families and other supporting other people, and they don’t do something for themselves, and I think we can do more to encourage that in this country,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b3736542f1d61f07fed49b310b7e5dfdbd58b3f/0_137_6200_3720/master/6200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fd30f3a2af639ed64d79f6dc47540cd","title":"james milner liverpool interview var premier league","story":"Before we explore the unglamorous roots of this story, James Milner captures the pain and glory of losing and winning a Champions League final and sails through the ebbs and flows of a Premier League career that has lasted 17 years so far.

Milner also reveals that he and Andy Robertson, his Liverpool teammate, have used a sleep-talking app – which proves that Milner speaks in Spanish while asleep.These topics are addressed in an entertaining book called Ask a Footballer. The footballer in question is Milner, who has made the sixth-most appearances in Premier League history while subverting his image from being parodied as the most boring man in football to becoming one of the most interesting players in the game. Milner answers a series of open-ended questions put to him, mostly by fans, and uses the concept to expand on his distinctive career.His early years were very different to the path followed by pampered young footballers today. He was 16 when he made his Premier League debut for Leeds in 2002 and the character of Milner was sealed in those gritty days. “Hundred percent,” he says. “I was playing in the Premier League and still cleaning the under-18s captain’s boots. I was scoring goals in the Premier League but, after the game, I’m picking up the kit, taking the dirty slips to the bus with the kitman. I had to make tea on the bus. After 20 games in the Premier League, with a few goals, the kitman said: ‘Go on, get on the bus.’ That made me feel so good. But it gave me such hunger and you knew your place.“It definitely helped me and they’re good values that I wish were still in the game. It would help young players. They’re now looked after amazingly well but there’s more scrutiny on social media. In some ways they probably have it harder than we did as kids.”Milner sounds pragmatic rather than wistful when pointing out that dressing rooms are now much quieter and more sanitised. But his remorseless professionalism has not cost him his wit or honesty. He still speaks in unvarnished detail when, like here, he is relaxed during an hour-long interview and I ask him about VAR: “I’m not a fan at all.”Milner grins when I remind him that, in his book, he says he hates VAR. “Yeah. It’s in writing. So we’ll go with that. It might just be the old school part of me but I think there’s still too much debate around VAR. Goal-line technology is incredible. Instant decision. Black and white. But it’s very hard to use VAR when you’ve still got opinions on the decisions and the atmosphere is being ruined. You score, there’s an explosion of noise and then it’s VAR. You wait. Is it a goal?Milner sounds almost nostalgic for the lunacy of Phil Dowd’s high-jinks as a referee when he was playing for Aston Villa. “I was being pulled back by the referee and I couldn’t believe it,” he says. “I think it was at Villa Park and I was running into the box. Me and Phil Dowd were close to each other, and he pulled my shirt. I look around, and I’m thinking: ‘Ref!’ But, hang on a moment, it is the ref! Afterwards you think: ‘Did that really happen?’”Did Dowd say much to him? “Yeah. We were joking about it. Strange. But it happened.”Milner also confirms that Jürgen Klopp really did wear CR7 boxer shorts when making his final team talk before Liverpool faced Ronaldo and Real Madrid in the 2018 Champions League final. “He thinks deeply about what he’s going to say before a game – and the CR7 thing broke the ice. This was just before we went to the ground for the final and we had our usual 15-minute meeting. He just lifted his top and had Cristiano’s boxer shorts on. Everyone started laughing – as you would before a Champions League final against one of the best players in the world and your manager’s wearing his boxer shorts. He just relaxed everyone. That’s why he’s such a good manager.”Did Klopp say much to Milner before this year’s Champions League final? Milner had started virtually every Champions League game – but he was on the bench in the final. “He didn’t say anything. He only explained his thinking to me after the game. He said he wanted me on the field at the end. If it got nervy he wanted me playing – especially if it went to extra time or penalties. I was obviously disappointed but you win things as a squad. After a day you think: ‘What can I do to help us win this trophy?’ Anyway I came on after an hour and we won. When you get over the line it’s amazing and you remember all the games you’ve played – like beating Barcelona 4-0 at Anfield. Winning it was incredible.”The league now matters most to Liverpool, after a 30-year wait, and Milner acknowledges that the yearning of the fans can be intense. “They started getting quite nervous early in the title race last season. It was the first time I had sensed that atmosphere at Anfield. But nothing really changes in the dressing room. The lads are always calm and confident and hopefully winning the Champions League settles people down. I hope they can just enjoy it. As much as people want the trophy, it’s the journey that you enjoy most.“This season we have a team that can do it. I think there’s a calm around the club, both inside and outside, and people are confident we can get it done. But City are so good they’re capable of winning every game. The gap is not that big so we have to just keep pushing, and not worry too much about the title.”A six-point lead seems a comfortable margin for Liverpool after 10 games, with nine wins and draw, but next weekend they face City. “A couple of bad games can happen,” Milner admits, “and with the amount of games we’re playing there might be a couple of injuries. It could be a couple of poor performances and the lead’s gone. That’s why it’s so special to win the league. It’s so difficult and the best team always wins the league, no matter what. Hopefully winning that first trophy, the European Cup, as a squad will give us the experience to win the league.”Milner played against United at Old Trafford – in the only game that Liverpool have dropped points so far. “They defended well and we only played our best for the last 15 minutes. It’s never easy after an international break. That’s no excuse but it might explain the lack of rhythm. The fight was there to the end and we got a point. You see that character in the squad time and time again. If someone’s not in the gym you say: ‘Where were you today?’ That’s the sort of dressing room we have. It’s massive.”Milner did not reveal the extent of his Spanish to Lionel Messi after he had fouled him in the first leg at Barcelona last season. Messi reminded Milner of how he nutmegged him while calling him a “burro” – without realising the Yorkshireman understood it meant donkey in English. “I just smiled and went back to the dressing room. We weren’t in the best position then. But Messi’s incredible. I’m lucky to have played against him and Ronaldo because the numbers they put up every year are ridiculous.”Yet Milner says that Wilfried Zaha is the player against whom he has had the most difficulty. “I’ve been sent off for tackles on him twice. He’s a talent. Unpredictable. You see how difficult it is to deal with him when you’re watching him. And when you play against Zaha he’s tricky and very tough to face.”Last week Patrice Evra said the same about Milner when naming him as the player against whom he struggled most. “I suppose it’s a compliment,” Milner says. “He thought I was a nuisance.”Milner had far more critics at the start of his career – and he could have been ruined by comments attributed to Graeme Souness, his manager at Newcastle, who apparently said you can never win anything with a team of 11 James Milners. “I was 18 so I wanted to show him he was wrong. Since then, he said he was misquoted. That was fuel for me, whether he said it or not. Ironically he was covering the game when we won the Premier League the first time at City. He didn’t have to come over but he did. He was very nice and I have no problems with him. I think he’s a legend.”Milner was tested at City. There were occasions when he would drive home from training in tears because, no matter how well he played, he was left out of the team. “It’s frustrating when you feel like you can’t do any more. But that’s where you need that character and strength to bounce back. I always had good people around me which helped. The biggest thing in football, and life, is that you make mistakes. The best players might make a mistake once, twice maximum. But they learn from it and never do it again.”Milner has learned from his mistakes and, even after making his 500th Premier League appearance last season, he is hungry for more. At 33 he still tops the fitness tests at Liverpool. “Someone said to me, a few years back, that I’m going to have to rein it in in training, and look after myself a bit. I didn’t agree. I felt that the more I pushed myself, then the higher level I get in terms of fitness. I still feel very good and no different to what I did six years ago. My contract with Liverpool is up at the end of the season but hopefully we’ll sort something out. I want to keep going as long as possible at the highest level.”This perhaps shows who is the most intelligent out of Liverpool’s two jokers? “You could say that. On the pitch Robbo is unbelievable and off the pitch he is a great character. He also had a difficult journey into football but his ability is massive. He’s a big presence within the dressing room, lively, enjoys a joke and never shuts up. It’s important to have those characters in the squad especially when, like us, you’re chasing something special.”James Milner’s Ask a Footballer is published by Quercus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b715aee2438815176eff384ac4dd64d02a1c2e44/122_422_3891_2334/master/3891.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a64b2247cb8eedfa0dbe1318c932c507","title":"psg angel di maria neymar kylian mbappe","story":"Neymar’s skill bamboozles opponent and Kylian Mbappé’s pace terrifies them, but Di María’s vision knits it all togetherBy Adam White and Eric Devin for Get French Football NewsWhen a frustrated Ángel Di María trudged off the pitch at the Allianz Riviera back in April 2017, it seemed as if the end was in sight. That 3-1 defeat to Nice drew a close to PSG’s title challenge and it felt like Di María’s very place at the club was under threat. An intelligent Nice under the wily Lucien Favre routed PSG in a game that finished with Di María being sent off for an angry slash at Arnaud Souquet. Two years later, Di María is in the form of his life. He set up three goals in PSG’s 4-0 win against Marseille in le classique on Sunday night – and it’s difficult to imagine the club succeeding without him.When Di María arrived in Paris in the summer of 2015 there was a sense he needed some convincing. He enjoyed a lightning start – his bullish and intense display in a close defeat to Real Madrid that November was a highlight – but quickly settled into a more sedate rhythm. Mirroring his excursion in the Premier League with Manchester United, his match-winning performances and flourishes of brilliance became rarer and rarer. Di María gave the impression he was living off his reputation and man-of-the-match in the Champions League final in 2014, which secured la décima for Real Madrid.Were PSG really right for him? Did he truly believe in the QSI project? Were they a big enough club? With performances deteriorating even before that sending off at Nice, the answer to at least two of those questions seemed to be “no”. Di María was linked with a move to Inter and, with the usual turnover likely at PSG, he was a prime candidate to move on, create space for other players and bring in funds to appease FFP.However, much like the rest of the continent, his view of PSG’s potential changed in the summer of 2017, when the club spent an unprecedented €400m on Neymar and Mbappé. Suddenly PSG had a forward line to rival – and maybe even beat – the very best. However, with Edinson Cavani and Julien Draxler in front of him in the traffic jam, not to mention Javier Pastore and Lucas Moura beeping their horns angrily behind, Di María was a long way from the starting XI. The club readily admitted as much, offering him to Monaco. But he – and a few of his attacking teammates – refused to move.With the MCN strikeforce of Mbappé, Cavani and Neymar fully established at the start of Unai Emery’s second and final season at the club, Di María was largely on the bench. However, a combination of injuries and suspensions after the winter break gave him the chance to start 11 games in a row. He seized his opportunity gleefully.There was speculation that Emery would even drop Mbappé to keep Di María in the team for the trip to the Bernabéu in the last-16 of the Champions League. Di María started neither game against Madrid – and both were lost – but he kept his place for the rest of the season and helped PSG win a domestic treble. In that time, he played like he knew his place was under threat and that he was desperate to keep it.Although Emery was swiftly moved on to Arsenal in the summer of 2018, Di María’s outstanding form had impressed the incoming Thomas Tuchel. The new manager experimented with various modes of attack at the beginning of last season, always looking for ways to squeeze Di María into his team. He tried him on the left wing, the right wing, in central midfield, as a striker and even at wing-back.Crucially, Di María was willing to adapt to whichever role Tuchel deemed appropriate, an obvious change in attitude compared to previous disagreements with Emery over whether he would play on the right or left wing. He finished last season with 11 assists in Ligue 1 only Téji Savanier set up more goals.Although Mbappé’s golden boy status and the perpetual circus around Neymar ert attention elsewhere, Di María has arguably been PSG’s best player under Tuchel – particularly this season. The club’s gaze is fiercely set on winning the Champions League and some of his best displays have come on European night. With Mbappé, Cavani and Neymar all missing for the match against Real Madrid in September, it was Di María who stepped up, scoring twice in a 3-0 win.The last 10 days have been a particularly productive for the Argentinian. Last Friday, he scored two world-class goals to put PSG out of sight of Nice, the second of which was an outrageous lob from a tight angle. He set up three goals as PSG eased past Club Brugge in midweek. And then pick up a hat-trick of assists against Marseille.While Neymar’s skill bamboozles and Mbappé’s pace terrifies defenders, it is Di María’s vision and delicious weight of pass that have become central PSG’s play over the last 18 months. It took €400m of arrivals and a serious fight to stay in the team, but Di María is now wholly committed. Whatever criticism his attitude has received throughout his career, Di María’s unplayable form does not look like ending any time soon.• Brest were this weekend’s big movers. Their third win in a row – a 2-0 victory over Dijon – takes the newly promoted team to fifth in the table, a feat made all the more impressive given what looked like an unproductive summer. Jean-Marc Furlan, the Ligue 2 expert who masterminded the club’s promotion, stayed in the second tier to try to repeat the feat with Auxerre – as did leading centre-back Anthony Weber and organised midfielder Jessy Pi, who both joined Caen. Although a smattering of Ligue 1 experience was added in the form of midfielder Paul Lasne from Montpellier and Ludovic Ball from Rennes, little else has changed.• Nice, on the other hand, suffered a third successive defeat. Jim Ratcliffe’s company, INEOS, finally assumed control of the club in August but the team is yet to come together in the same way. The influence of last year’s stars, Youcef Attal and Wylan Cyprien, has fallen away injuries to starting centre-backs Dante and Christophe Hérelle have been prohibitive and new signing Alexis Claude-Maurice is yet to adapt to the top flight after leaving second-tier Lorient. Patrick Vieira will be given plenty of time, but he is again searching for the right formula.• This is an article from Get French Football News• Follow Eric Devin, Adam White and GFFN on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7821e31b488c5b23628e7371f1ccd2a501f4ba0d/122_270_2202_1320/master/2202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=388ede4c41ab51b6c8fb1efc7bdd6ba9","title":"liverpool leicester var granada football weekly podcast","story":"Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Faye Carruthers and Flo Lloyd-Hughes discuss Liverpool’s comeback victory over Spurs, Leicester’s record-breaking rout, the VAR high-bar being too low and Granada topping La LigaJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Yurong is an Asian studies librarian and David is a professor of Chinese historyDavid had just graduated in the US when he went to China, aged 22, to teach English, with one instruction from the dean of his college: not to fall in love. “So I didn’t have any sort of intentions of romantic involvement at all,” he says. He arrived at Yunnan University in the summer of 1989, weeks after the protests in Tiananmen Square.In October, he asked to accompany a British teacher on a three-day trip through Yunnan province. She had already asked Yurong, who had studied English at university, to go with her as a translator. “I was waiting for them at the bus stop and, when they walked over, he was this tall, young guy,” says Yurong.They spent all of their first day on the train. “Peasants got on and got off with their livestock, their grain,” says Yurong. “There were people selling food. David was able to speak some basic Chinese, but I was the main person who helped them to communicate. He was sitting across from me and I was looking at him thinking: ‘His eyes are really beautiful.’ He was also very easy to talk to.”What does David remember about Yurong? “The Chinese wanted to treat foreigners in a very particular way, keep us in our own corner, but she was very laid-back,” he says. He was concerned she would think he wasn’t up to eating local food and feared three days of bland, foreigner-friendly dishes. “I said: ‘Make sure mine are spicy.’ She turned to the guy that was selling the noodles and said: ‘He wants his extra-spicy.’ I was eating this bowl of chilli noodles and she was smiling at me – she had a sense of humour, which I was attracted to.”When did they realise they had feelings for each other? “Day two,” says David. They both laugh. Their companion went to bed early and David and Yurong took a walk along the railway tracks out into the fields. “We made lots of jokes about what was surrounding us, the people walking by. Getting to know each other,” says Yurong. She was walking on the rail, with David holding her hand – “to keep her steady”, he says. “It seemed the right moment – and right height? – to kiss, so we did.”Back in Kunming, they were concerned about rumours of their relationship getting to Yurong’s family. “So, we had to make a decision about our relationship really quickly – there was no halfway,” says David. “By day five, we had decided we did want to be a couple and she had to tell her parents.” They also had to put up with attention from people unused to seeing a western man with a Chinese woman. “It’s almost like you have no privacy,” says Yurong. “We just had to ignore lots of the stares and not be bothered by that.” At the same time, another western teacher called David was rumoured to be seeing several young Chinese women. “When rumours about us got back to my university, they all thought it was that David, not me,” says David. “So we had this unintentional free run for a couple of months.”Yurong wouldn’t normally have considered marriage so quickly, but they had to think about visas. So, in March 1990, after months of paperwork, they tied the knot. David sent a telegram to the dean of his college: “Regrets. Advice not taken. Am married.”They moved to the US in July 1990, 10 months after they had met, where they both pursued careers in academia, specialising in Chinese history and occasionally working together. Since then, they have split their time between the US and China, and brought up their two children bilingually and biculturally.In Mandarin, the same word can be given different meanings by using different tones. “With one word, one tone can mean virtuous and another means stupid. A friend said we were virtuous and I think it’s the other way around, that we were stupid,” says David, with a laugh. “We went into it without realising what was ahead of us and it just worked out.”Want to share your story?

They don’t want their work to be undervalued. It affects everything about their lives, it’s not just about finances which are important … it is also about self-respect and about progression as well as pay.”Gracie said that women such as Ahmed were willing to risk damage to their career in order to see “equality honoured” after being unsatisfied with the BBC’s internal pay review processes: “Her case is emblematic and extremely important to all the other women still fighting.”Equal pay is different to the broader issue of the gender pay gap. Cases brought under equal pay legislation are based on specific claims that an inidual was paid less than a colleague for doing the same, or equivalent, work.Gracie also highlighted wider concerns about BBC executives being unwilling to accept they have made mistakes, citing the recent row over the handling of a complaint against Naga Munchetty regarding comments about Donald Trump: “This is not the kind of thing that management likes to see. None of these people are going to be the favourites of their management while doing this.”However, they are resisting Ahmed’s claim that she was unfairly paid for her work presenting Newswatch , for which she received £440 an episode. She claims this is unfair because at the same time Jeremy Vine was paid £3,000 for presenting each episode of Points of View, a programme of similar length also featuring viewer feedback on BBC programmes. Calculations suggest the total claim for five years of systematic underpayment could be as much as half a million pounds.Ahmed’s tribunal hearing was closed to the public and reporters, as her representatives argued with BBC lawyers over whether to redact certain material.According to an inidual with knowledge of the case, the judge ordered the BBC to disclose internal documents relevant to the case. As a result witnesses will only start giving evidence on Wednesday in hearings that could be potentially embarrassing for the broadcaster and lay bare some of its pay discussions.Before entering the hearing Ahmed, who is fighting the case with the support of the National Union of Journalists, issued a statement insisting she continued to believe in the BBC’s mission.“I have a sense of pride working for a public service broadcaster which seeks to represent the ersity of Britain and its licence-fee payers. On the back of my BBC ID card are written the BBC values, which include ‘we respect each other and celebrate our ersity’ and ‘we take pride in delivering quality and value for money’,” she said.“I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.”A BBC spokesperson said: “Points of View is an entertainment programme with a long history and is a household name with the public. Newswatch – while an important programme – isn’t. Samira was paid the same as her male predecessor when she began presenting Newswatch. Gender has not been a factor in levels of pay for Points of View. News and entertainment are very different markets and pay across the media industry reflects this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a03050098d6c4377239f446f238df0b980cbddd9/0_32_4044_2426/master/4044.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87ddb1d7dea55033e07fb3b60527776b","title":"damian carrington on 10 years as the guardians environment editor","story":"One of our leading environment journalists reflects on how awareness of the climate crisis has shifted in the last decade and offers advice for those who want to do moreWhat did you do before you joined the ?I did a PhD and post-doc research in geology at Edinburgh University, including an expedition to Antarctica, which was amazing: beautiful, pristine with bursts of life along the coast. But I think my attention  was a bit short for academic life, so I started writing science stories for newspapers. My first staff job was at BBC Tomorrow’s World magazine, then BBC News Online. I went to New Scientist next and then the Financial Times. In 2008, I was delighted to be hired by the , which was – and is! – my favourite paper.How has awareness of the climate crisis changed in the last decade? What do you think the big milestones have been? When I joined the , concern about the climate crisis was running high, following a landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore’s film, An Inconvenient Truth – the IPCC and Gore went on to win the Nobel peace prize. But it was seen as a future problem. The transformative moment was meant to come at the 2009 UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. But it didn’t happen and after that the impacts of the global financial crisis grabbed all the attention. It wasn’t until 2015, by which time the role of human activities in driving climate change was undeniable, that a big step forward was taken with the Paris deal. How has your role in covering the environment changed in that time? has always taken the environment very seriously. In the decade I have been here, the team has expanded. But the basic approach has largely stayed the same – environmental issues affect everything, so should feature across all our coverage: reporting, exposing and holding to account. Today, the climate crisis is here, evident in more frequent and more severe extreme weather and climate change deniers have been relegated to the far fringes. With the global youth climate strikes inspired by Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion protests, 2019 feels like a new chapter. Those who have campaigned for decades are feeling hopeful. What would you say are the most important environmental issues?The climate emergency is the best known, and it will take systemic change to beat it. But the annihilation of wildlife and the destruction of nature is just as crucial in my view – we depend on the natural world for almost everything. The huge scale of the losses – from forests to insects to marine life – has only really become widely reported in the last few years. Pollution is the third issue, particularly the toxic air that causes millions of early deaths every year. Air is actually getting cleaner in some rich nations, but the understanding of how damaging it is – on everything from intelligence to miscarriages – is only really emerging now. Chemical pollution is also a serious global problem, from fertiliser to pesticides to PCBsWhat frustrates you about how these issues are sometimes be covered?One thing is the charge of hypocrisy that is often levelled at environment campaigners because they have a TV or something. Just because you have to live in the world as it is today doesn’t mean you can’t campaign to make it a better place tomorrow. But I think hypocrisy is the attack made by people who know they’ve lost the real argument.Has your work influencedinformed the way you live your life?Yes. It’s impossible to write about it every day and not act. I am vegan at home and whenever I can elsewhere. My home is fully insulated and my energy supplier is renewable. I rarely fly for holidays – one short haul flight in the last couple of years – and usually go to Ireland by ferry to surf. I’ve also cycled to work for about 13 years now – it’s cheap, fast and healthy. Being green is often worthwhile for many reasons.What would you say to readers who want to tackle the environmental crisis?The big shifts will be driven by the governments we elect (in democracies) and the companies to which we give our custom. Demanding urgent action from those leaders is vital. But personal action is also important, in itself and as an encouragement to others. The biggest action, according to scientists, is having fewer children, but that of course is a deeply personal and complex choice. Flying less and eating less meat and dairy also make big cuts in your impact, as does driving fewer petrol-powered miles and insulating your home.How can we build on the urgency we’ve seen from many campaigners in 2019 and keep the spotlight fixed firmly on the big changes we need?We are in a race against time and it’s not at all certain that we are going to win. We understand the problems and what we have to do, more or less, but the pace of action is far too slow. Putting pressure on politicians and business leaders is key – giving them a strong reason to move faster. The good news is that many solutions gain their own momentum once started. In many places, solar and wind power is now the cheapest electricity, and electric cars are the cheapest to own. But there are still big problems to solve, including agriculture and aviation. The young people involved in the climate strikes will be running the world in the not-too-distant future. But we have to make sure we are still in the race by then.What have been the highlights of your reporting at the  so far? What has made you most proud?I have written nearly 2,000 stories for the , and I’d hope most of them have played a part in building awareness of environmental issues. It’s usually hard to know how much impact stories have behind the scenes, but the restoration of slashed flood defence funding in England followed a lot of reporting by me, as did the EU ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, which harm bees. The recent resignation of the executive director of the UN environment programme also followed a string of my stories, which was a good example of the  holding power to account. The environment team get a lot of positive feedback from readers, scientists and policymakers, which is very heartening. One prominent scientist recently told me: “Thank God for the !”What is the area within your work and reporting expertise that you feel most passionately about?Usually the story I’m working on right now. But in recent years I’ve done a lot on pesticides, insects, the impact of livestock, microplastics and harmful subsidies. And badgers. I’ve written a lot about the cull in England. One of my editors here said I had “made the  the paper of choice for small mammals”, which may or may not have been a compliment.What about the highs and lows of doing the job?Often, this is the best job in the world. I’ve been fortunate to see a lot of the Earth’s natural beauty. I’ve tracked forest elephants in Gabon, been swimming with giant mantas in the Males and walked through extraordinary landscapes high in the Andes. On the other hand, almost every day I have to report more destruction and degradation of the environment. The most heartbreaking story I have covered is the poisoning of children with lead in a former mining town in Zambia. But I was glad to be able to expose it at least.What’s next for you and the team?The next 12 months are going to be absolutely pivotal for the world. There’s a major UN bioersity conference in China next year – the targets set a decade ago have been woefully missed. The UN climate summit in Glasgow, UK, in 2020 will also be vital – nations are going to have to make big increases in the carbon cuts they pledge if we are to get anywhere near the 1.5C temperature rise seen as a safety limit. And we’ll be reporting day in, day out, across the world holding nations and companies to account for the environment and for social justice.What makes the  unique?John Vidal, my brilliant predecessor as environment editor, says: “Environment is the world and everything in it”, and I think the issue now permeates all the newspaper’s coverage. That is because the  has always taken the issue seriously, with full support from the top and the resources to match. Our readers really care too, and they tell us. I’d guess there aren’t many places where all that is the case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c888c05020efef3e44e10231cc4e2e8e9669067f/0_171_5067_3041/master/5067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdefdec4da880aa33afcaba98a7a5898","title":"julio iglesias how we made begin the beguine","story":"‘It was a hit with women. I like to flirt. What can I say?’I wasn’t a very good goalkeeper but I played for the reserves of a great team – the 1960-61 Real Madrid “Galácticos” that included Alfredo Di Stéfano and Ferenc Puskás.However, when I was 19, I was in a car accident, almost died and was left completely paralysed. It took me two years to learn to walk again. My hands didn’t have much strength so I was given a guitar to help me regain movement in them. I started making little simple harmonies, then simple songs. I learned to play and became a singer: a bad singer! Now? I’m not so bad. It became my passion, and I became the biggest selling artist ever in Spain.Begin the Beguine is a Cole Porter standard, one of the most beautiful songs from the 1940s and 50s. I’d heard it on the radio many times and one day suggested covering it. My producer did an incredible new arrangement and I changed the lyrics completely. I think the song was originally about a dance, but I wrote about a lost love, someone you want to go back to. Everything in life is about personal experiences – your feelings, your brain and your chromosomes. So as an artist you express that. I’m Spanish, but these things are universal. The song was a hit with women. I adore, learn from and respect women. I like to flirt. What can I say?Begin the Beguine was my first hit in the UK. Piccadilly Radio in Manchester played it, then the other stations followed. It went to No 1 in the UK and changed my life completely. It felt like a miracle. When I was a child and singing in the house, my father had once said to me: “Do you want to be like Frank Sinatra?” So after Begin the Beguine was an international smash and Sinatra invited me to sing at his all-star party, I thought about my father. None of this would have happened if that radio programmer hadn’t picked the song for Piccadilly. I’m a great believer in good luck.I met Julio when my songwriting partner Manuel de la Calva and I wrote the song that won the 1968 Eurovision Song Contest – La, La, La by Massiel. The day before the ceremony in London, this guy came up to me and said, “I’ll tell you two things: you are going to win Eurovision and you are going to hear about me.” That was Julio Iglesias.Years later, I’d started producing artists when Julio’s manager came up to me at a festival in Chile and suggested we meet. I told him I wasn’t interested. But then a few months later, when I wrote a song called Sono un Pirata, Sono un Signore (“I am a pirate, I am a good man”), I wanted Julio to sing it. It was the start of a long working relationship, and we sold millions of records.Begin the Beguine was on a list of potential songs for the fourth album we did together. We recorded in Madrid – the rhythm section first, then the brass, the violins, guitars and so on. I changed a couple of the lyrics. We used the rhythm from the Johnny Mathis disco version but made a very different arrangement.I remember the session because we kept having to add more treble to the recording. It just didn’t sound right. I later found out that the big studio speakers had just arrived – and they were still full of all the paper and packaging they’d been shipped in, so that’s why we kept having to add all that treble.You have a feeling in the studio when something comes right, and we definitely had that with Begin the Beguine. Julio’s voice floats over the music, like Sinatra’s or Nat King Cole’s. It was very unusual for a song sung in Spanish to be a British hit. I suppose everyone knows the word “begin”. My wife’s mother – who is English – says: “I don’t understand a word of what Julio is singing, but I believe him.”He is a perfectionist in the studio. Every word has to be just right, so he’ll do take after take after take. I’ve spent more time with Julio than most of his girlfriends.• Julio Iglesias plays the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 28 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fb6235ed6bb9206288e172d398422335ad0adf7/552_1064_3091_1854/master/3091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f000011386f2c378a2b63e2c82a8a1d","title":"harriet harman on political survival if youve been an outsider you never forget","story":"After almost 40 years in parliament, she wants to be Speaker and restore public faith in politics. She talks about anger, antisemitism and abuseIt is the end of yet another momentous week in parliament and Harriet Harman’s kitchen is a picture of cheery domestic chaos. Her two beloved cats are climbing the curtains, there is a pile of washing waiting and Holly, her young granddaughter, who is currently staying, toddles in and out. Harman apologises for the mess, but is clearly rather enjoying having a highchair at the table again.It is 37 years since she arrived in Westminster, heavily pregnant and feeling like a “fish out of water”, as she described it. Male Tory MPs would shout “stupid cow” at her across the chamber, while the things she longed to debate – such as her south London constituents’ struggle to find childcare while they worked, or feminist reforms she had taken up as a young lawyer – were deemed trivial. At her lowest ebb – contracting pneumonia while exhausted from juggling an opposition frontbench job and small children – she considered quitting. But instead she rose to the cabinet under Tony Blair, served as caretaker Labour leader after Ed Miliband left and is now running to succeed John Bercow as Speaker of the House of Commons when he retires next month, on a platform of putting parliament back in touch with the public that it serves.Leafing through her notes from the mini listening tour she has undertaken, asking people around the country what they think of parliament, underlines how difficult that has become. Westminster politics is seen as aggressive, entitled, phoney and unprofessional, a braying bear pit hopelessly out of step with modern workplaces, where respect and empathy are increasingly valued. “One woman said: ‘I’m a trade union negotiator. I’d get nowhere if I walked into a negotiation and behaved like that,’” Harman recalls. “One of the things that’s been very striking is that people think the anger that’s displayed in parliament is an artefact, that it’s basically fake, playing up to the cameras. So if anybody’s under the impression that their anger is regarded as inspiring by people outside – people don’t buy it.” And that hints at something more complicated than the crude “people v parliament” narrative pushed by Downing Street, pitting furious leave voters against a supposedly obstructive elite.Harman’s research suggests the angry, uncompromising stances that many Brexiters (and, arguably, parts of the left) see as connoting passion or ideological purity don’t always come across that way to voters, many of whom see squabbling and ision merely as proof of impotence. Resorting to shouting is seen as “the ultimate failure of an institution”, says Harman. “In the outside world, people disagree about Brexit but they get along.” If she’s right, then politicians who believe they are channelling the public mood by ratcheting up their language may be in for a shock come a general election.She insists that doesn’t necessarily mean a bland or neutered politics, citing the 2003 debate over the Iraq war, during which the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, resigned. “Nobody felt that there weren’t passionate beliefs on all sides, nobody felt that was not a debate of the utmost seriousness. There were very big isions in the country and in parliament. Yet the debates did not descend into shouting, abuse and finger-jabbing. It’s not about dumbing down parliament or fudging over differences, it’s about respecting what the people think about their parliament. We can’t ignore that because, if people have contempt for their parliament, that’s undermining parliamentary democracy and creates a vacuum.”Parliament rarely looks more out of touch than during the state opening, when the Queen arrives in a horse-drawn carriage to a flurry of bowing, but Harman isn’t advocating reducing the pomp. “I think people recognise that for what it is, part of our culture and heritage and tradition.” And while she backs changing summer recess dates to reflect Scottish school holidays, which would allow Scottish MPs some time away from Westminster while their children are off, more broadly she insists that it’s not for the Speaker to dictate how parliament should modernise, but merely to facilitate what MPs want.Still, the longest-serving female MP must think it is ridiculous that MPs have no formal right to maternity leave from their constituency and that Labour’s Stella Creasy has had to have a public battle to get locum cover for when she gives birth this autumn. Harman says that attitudes have shifted thanks to the influx not only of women MPs but of men who expect time off when they become fathers. “I remember, back in the day, one of my fellow MPs got up and said: ‘On a point of order, Mr Chairman, can I just ask the committee to take note that my wife has just had a baby?’ I was thinking: ‘So why are you here?’ but everyone was like ‘hear hear’ and then we carried on with the committee. That’s not the aspiration of men having young families now in the House of Commons or outside.” Yet as she concedes, it was just last year that pregnant MPs won the right to vote by proxy, and that was only after Labour’s Tulip Siddiq arrived in a wheelchair on the day she was due to give birth. “You mustn’t ram raid things through, but really, it’s kind of glacial, the pace of change.”Worse still, some now fear progress shifting into reverse, thanks to a tide of threats and abuse disproportionately targeted at female, black and gay politicians and seemingly designed to intimidate them out of public life.“Women speaking up is like a red rag to the misogynist bull,” sighs Harman. “That’s what the response to the significant advance of women in parliament has been a significant backlash together with social media enabling anonymous threats and abuse.” She doesn’t see it putting Labour women off standing for parliament, but worries that “people stand down earlier than they might because of that”.And latterly, such abuse hasn’t always come from outside the party. Female and ethnic minority MPs have been disproportionately targeted so far in the trigger ballots allowing local party members to seek to replace their candidates, just as women warned would happen when Corbyn changed the rules. Lucy Powell, the Manchester Central MP, has argued the process has become in parts about “trying to put a lid on opinionated, outspoken women” in South Shields, Emma Lewell-Buck has raised allegations of bullying and harassment within the local party.Like many Labour MPs, Harman expressed dismay when Louise Ellman, the Jewish Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside who had faced a long and vitriolic campaign to oust her, resigned the whip, saying Labour was “no longer a safe place for Jews”. (Ellman’s critics accuse her of jumping before she could be deselected. That isn’t true, Harman insists she was tipped to survive the trigger ballot process.) So what, apart from issuing anguished statements of regret, are MPs like Harman going to do about tackling antisemitism within Labour?Shouldn’t Corbyn take some personal responsibility for what is erupting within his party? Harman chooses her words carefully: “I think the thing about leadership is that it’s your responsibility not just to have the right position, but to ensure that it’s the position of the party as a whole. That’s not just about saying: ‘I’m totally opposed to antisemitism, I do not condone it, I’ve never engaged in it.’ Leadership is about making sure that wherever it shows itself, it’s absolutely stamped down on. I think that has been the problem.“It’s important to respect and support the autonomy of the members and that’s a role of leadership, but it’s also a role of leadership that if members are doing something which is egregiously wrong, you clamp down on it. You have got to be tough and directive to be an effective leader as well as supportive of your grassroots.”Even such veiled criticism is significant because, unlike many of her old political allies, Harman has remained publicly loyal to each successive Labour leader, whatever her private misgivings. (She declined to serve on Corbyn’s frontbench, arguing that she had had her turn, but her husband, the MP Jack Dromey, does.) She takes a broadly stoical view of the current turmoil, having lived through Neil Kinnock’s struggle with the hard left when Labour councillors going into meetings were spat on by local activists. “My constituency party had to be suspended in the 80s because there were fights in general committee meetings. Someone pulled a gun at a meeting and I was like: ‘This has really gone beyond ...’ and they said: ‘No, it was only an imitation gun,’” she recalls. “I’m not saying that what’s happening now should be discounted, but the party found its equilibrium after that turmoil and it will do again after all this.”Yet in the Speaker’s job she has perhaps identified a role that would lift her out of the fray, obliging her to become a neutral servant of parliament during a constitutional struggle over Brexit that transcends party lines. While critics argue she’s too establishment for what became, under Bercow, a reforming and even activist role, she clearly finds the charge bizarre, having spent her life being criticised for being too radical in her feminism, only to find her causes eventually becoming mainstream.“I’ve certainly been there a long time and stuck it out – if that’s what you call establishment, surviving, definitely ... But if you’ve been an outsider, a very young woman in a parliament of older men, you never ever forget the contempt with which your views were treated and you never ever forget your complete frustration that other people’s views could be accepted with reverence.”Does she feel sympathy then for Theresa May, as Tory Brexiters who snubbed her deal leap on board her male successor’s version? For the first time, Harman falters. “You stand or fall by what you can achieve,” she says eventually. “I wouldn’t want to, because she’s a woman, make excuses ... I mean, she was the prime minister, for heaven’s sake. If you can’t take responsibility for your own successes and failures when you are prime minister, then when can you?”She is more comfortable agreeing with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, that the next Labour leader should be a woman, having ducked out of running for the job herself in the past. “I do remember people saying, when I was acting leader: ‘Why aren’t you going for the real thing?’ but I sort of treated it as if they were being polite. I wasn’t quite convinced they really meant it.”Instead, at 69, she sees herself as part of a wave of older women refusing to leave the workplace quietly. “There are a lot of women who stepped back when their kids were younger and they’re now ready to step back up, but find that, too often, people think: ‘Oh, now you’re past it,’” she says. “One minute you’re too young, the next you’re too old, whereas with men they’re always in their prime.”Yet with age, she thinks, comes at least one consolation. “If people have just got used to you, they’ll deal with what you say at face value, and that gives you opportunities to do things that you wouldn’t have been able to before ... A lot of them were scared of me when I first arrived for good or ill, I don’t frighten them any more.” She grins. “I’ve obviously got to up my game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61de7652c789f056aa3e3cd97f0cf53af8058a50/0_26_2001_1201/master/2001.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a0f1673fa3c8d08bc4b178cc90d8027","title":"no 10 says it could back lib dem plan for 9 december election","story":"Government could back plan if it fails to pass motion under Fixed-term Parliaments ActDowning Street has indicated it will back a plan by the Liberal Democrats to change the law in order to hold a December election if Labour refuses to back Boris Johnson’s motion for an early poll.A No 10 source attempted to put pressure on Labour to back its motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for an election on 12 December, saying the government would turn to the Lib Dem plan as an alternative.The law requires there be at least 25 working days (five weeks) between calling an election and polling day. That realistically leaves only three Thursdays when the UK could have an election this year.12 December has emerged as Boris Johnson\u0027s favoured date.\u0026nbspAny later seems unlikely as it will be seen as an unwelcome intrusion into the festive season - and difficult to organise, as many of the venues needed for polling stations will be busy with Christmas and holiday events.Despite repeated assurances, Boris Johnson seems set to miss his 31 October deadline for Brexit. The Benn act specified 31 January 2020 as the UK\u0027s preferred length of extension and new Brexit date, but it is possible the EU might opt for a shorter period of time to focus minds. Any EU extension is likely to be a \u0027flextension\u0027 - with a set end date, but the opportunity for the UK to leave earlier if parliament can ratify a withdrawal agreement.An alternative scenario is for Johnson to prefer to use an EU extension period to force his withdrawal agreement bill through parliament before Christmas, exit the EU with his deal at the end of January, and then press for an election in FebruaryMarch 2020 having \u0027got Brexit done\u0027.Johnson needs Labour support to get a two-thirds majority for an election under current legislation, and Jeremy Corbyn is refusing to back one while the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is still alive.Over the weekend, the Lib Dems offered to help Johnson change the law to allow an election on 9 December, which would need only a simple majority in parliament.A No 10 source said: “Tonight is Labour’s last chance to have an election with Brexit delivered – they can vote for the 12th and get Brexit done before. If not, we will introduce a bill almost identical to the Lib DemSNP one tomorrow.“This parliament has repeatedly failed to deliver on its promise to respect the referendum. Millions of families and businesses can’t plan because of constant delays. We need a new parliament by Christmas so we can get Brexit done in January and the country can move on.”It is not clear how the government’s proposal for a bill would differ and it is possible that No 10 could be using the idea to put pressure on Labour before tabling legislation that the Lib Dems could not back.However, Lib Dem sources indicated they would be willing to support any legislation that was fundamentally similar to their own and confirmed they would not pursue amendments in order to ensure the bill had the best chance possible of getting through.It is understood that the bill would need to be tabled on Tuesday and passed by Thursday in order for a 9 December election to take place. Corbyn suggested on Monday that his party could abstain on the government motion on Monday but back the Lib Dem plan.“We will consider carefully any legislation on an early election,” he said, adding that a date needed to be locked down in law to prevent Johnson from trying to move it for his own advantage.Corbyn also suggested he would want an election to be held earlier than 12 December and before students break up for the winter holiday, saying any plan would need to “protect the voting rights of all of our citizens”.Earlier, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, framed the situation as “the Lib Dem and Tory pact of 2010 being re-established”. He said: “They are back together, selling out the People’s Vote campaign and the cross-party campaign to prevent a no deal. The Lib Dems will stop at nothing to get their ministerial cars back.”Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, hit back at McDonnell, tweeting: “In the last 10 days I’ve addressed a #PeoplesVote March and tabled an amendment to the Queen’s speech that would have given us a people’s vote. Your leader did neither. Don’t lecture me about fighting for a people’s vote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/875f103d3d7f6684f6fe042a3bf6a393df39f23d/0_282_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22d2fa1fdd8d67dc63a1f7d209f01d73","title":"ancestral home of modern humans is in botswana study finds","story":"Other scientists raise questions about results, which were based on DNA samplesScientists claim to have traced the ancestral home region of all living humans to a vast wetland that sprawled over much of modern day Botswana and served as an oasis in an otherwise parched expanse of Africa.The swathe of land south of the Zambezi River became a thriving home to Homo sapiens 200,000 years ago, the researchers suggest, and sustained an isolated, founder population of modern humans for at least 70,000 years.The group remained in the region until a shift in the climate, driven by changes in the Earth’s tilt and orbit, brought rains to the north-east and south-west, producing lush green corridors that allowed the early humans to spread into new territories, the scientists say.“We have known for a long time that modern humans originated in Africa and roughly 200,000 years ago, but what we hadn’t known until this study was where exactly,” said Prof Vanessa Hayes, a geneticist and senior author on the study at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney.The conclusions, which have raised eyebrows among some experts, are based on an analysis of 1,217 samples of mitochondrial DNA, the genetic material in tiny battery-like mitochondria found in most cells. All of the DNA used in the study came from people living in southern Africa today, including the Khoisan, a population who speak with “click” consonants and traditionally practiced foraging.Hayes and her colleagues used the mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down exclusively from mother to child, to map out the oldest known maternal line of humans alive today. According to their report in the journal Nature, the so-called L0 lineage and its sub-branches point back to an “ancestral home” that spreads from Namibia across Botswana and into Zimbabwe.The researchers next turned to geological, archaeological and fossil evidence to glean details about the climate and broader ecosystem in the region at the time. They found that a body of water the size of New Zealand, called Lake Makgadikgadi, once dominated the area, but had started to break up into a massive wetland 200,000 years ago. “It would have been very lush and it would have provided a suitable habitat for modern humans and wildlife to have lived,” Hayes said.According to the DNA analyses, the L0 lineage split 130,000 years ago when some of the founder population moved north-east along a green vegetated route that opened up as rains drenched the arid land. A second wave of migration headed south-west about 20,000 years later as rainfall also increased vegetation in that direction. Those who headed north-east gave rise to farming populations, while those who went south became coastal foragers, the scientists believe. “Essentially, these ancestors were the first human explorers,” Hayes said.But other researchers are not convinced. “I’m definitely cautious about using modern genetic distributions to infer exactly where ancestral populations were living 200,000 years ago, particularly in a continent as large and complex as Africa,” said Chris Stringer, who studies human origins at the Natural History Museum in London. “Like so many studies that concentrate on one small bit of the genome, or one region, or one stone tool industry, or one ‘critical’ fossil, it cannot capture the full complexity of our mosaic origins, once other data are considered.”Stringer points out that analyses of the male-inherited Y chromosome suggest our Y-carrying ancestors may have originated from west Africa. Further studies, which have looked at whole genomes, point to populations who migrated out of Africa originating in the continent’s east. “These and many other data suggest that we are an amalgam of ancestry from different regions of Africa with, of course, the addition of interbreeding from other human groups outside the continent,” he said.Sarah Tishkoff, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania, also raised doubts. “How can they know that there aren’t old lineages in other regions if they’re not included in the study?” she said.“It is not possible to make inferences about the geographical origin of modern humans in Africa based solely on patterns of variation in modern populations. This is because humans migrate over long distances. They migrated out of Africa and across the globe within the past 80,000 years and they have migrated across Africa in the recent and ancient past.”Rebecca Ackermann, an archaeologist at the University of Cape Town, said the study appeared to brush aside extensive evidence that suggests the roots of our species are pan-African and beyond. “Drawing sweeping conclusions about places of origin from analyses of this tiny part of the modern genome is deeply problematic and outdated,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36a56dc4da0880bf5cfe6b2101e1a19ef8cd57e6/0_100_2860_1716/master/2860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23fdeeec6e930667ab187d546ddc9aff","title":"scientists crack mystery of bird eggs colour variation","story":"Darker eggs may be at an advantage in colder regions as they are more heat-absorbentScientists have cracked the mystery of why bird eggs are different colours, with new research suggesting it boils down to temperature.The appearance of bird eggs is rooted in two pigments, one of which is greenish and the other reddish-brown. Different concentrations of these pigments, together with the underlying white calcium carbonate of the shell, give rise to colours ranging from deep blue to greenish-white and rich brown.But what influences the appearance of the eggs that different birds lay has been a topic of hot debate, with theories including the need for camouflage from predators, mitigating the harmful effect of UV light on the embryo’s DNA, helping birds recognise which eggs are theirs – and even that different colours may have different antimicrobial properties.Researchers say while these factors might still play a role – particularly at a local level – a key influence at a global scale is temperature.“Eggs in these colder places are darker brown and then as you go towards the tropics and even the temperate zone there are just more competing selection pressures, so there is more variation in colours,” said Dr Daniel Hanley, a co-author of the study from Long Island University.With global temperatures rising, he said one concern was the impact on organisms such as birds that have traits adapted to particular climates.Writing in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, Hanley and colleagues report how they analysed the colour and brightness of one egg from each of 634 species of bird from around the globe, and looked at the breeding range for each species.The team then took the average for egg brightness and colour across the communities of birds in a given area and created a map of the results. Hanley said most species had eggs with a certain appearance, even though there could be some variation between different females.The map reveals that darker eggs tend to be more common in regions with lower solar intensity and hence colder, while eggs are more variable, albeit generally brighter, in areas with higher solar intensity and hence warmer. The trend held even when different nest types were considered.While cooler places are generally linked to browner eggs, a variety of colours from brown to blue are found in warmer regions.Although levels of UVB radiation are also higher in areas of higher solar intensity, the team say this is unlikely to be driving the results since darker blue-green eggs would be best at blocking such light, but eggs in higher-radiation areas were generally brighter than in chilly ones. In any case, they add, eggshells are generally poor at letting light through. The team say it makes sense for the brightness and even colour of eggs to be linked to temperatures. Darker, more heat-absorbent eggs could be at an advantage in colder regions since the embryo within an egg needs to be kept within a narrow temperature range but has no way of regulating this itself.To back up their theory, the team took eggs from different chicken breeds and put them in sunlight. They found that darker ones heated faster than brighter ones and their surface temperature remained higher for longer.They add that the variability in eggshell colour and even brightness in warmer regions may be down to less of a need to absorb heat, and more related to other competing factors such antimicrobial properties, predation risk or eggshell strength, which could possibly favour different colours.Prof Simon Griffith, an expert in avian ecology at Macquarie University in Australia who was not involved in the research, said the study showed how birds across the world had adapted the colour of their eggs to the challenges imposed by environmental conditions.But he said questions remained. “The study examined eggshell brightness overall, but this can be influenced by both the background colour and the amount and type of spotting or streaking,” he said. “This study does not shed any light on why some eggs are spotted, some are streaked and some have a uniform colour.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa65098d77ed086d3b9aba7a1cd325fb9741316f/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=517ad0ae60955c5b482c867206ff5ea3","title":"us air force space plane nasa kennedy space center","story":"The air force’s mystery space plane is back on Earth, following a record-breaking two-year mission.The X-37B landed at Nasa’s Kennedy space center in Florida early Sunday.

Before the ban, the participating staff consumed on average more than a litre of sugary drinks daily, but 10 months later had slashed their intake by nearly half.Medical assessments of the staff found they had lost an average of more than 2cm around the waist, and that those who reduced their sugary drink intake tended to have better insulin resistance and lower cholesterol.“A simple sales ban has meaningful effects on employees’ health,” said Elissa Epel, a professor of psychiatry who led the work. “This is very exciting news, because to eliminate sales of sugary beverages is something any institution can do.” The ban was only on sales and did not prevent people from bringing sugary drinks to work, or buying them off-site.Beyond investigating the impact of the sales ban itself, Epel randomly assigned half of the staff to also receive a motivational intervention. This involved showing them how much sugar they were consuming – for example, one sugary drink per day was equivalent to a plastic cup half full of sugar cubes. The staff were also given information on how sugar harms health and were helped to identify reasons they might want to adopt a healthier lifestyle.Eating too much sugar contributes to people having too many calories during the day, which can lead to weight gain. Being overweight increases the risk of health problems such as heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Sugar is also one of the main causes of tooth decay.\u0026nbspThe NHS advises that most adults and children in the UK eat too much of a type of sugar called \u0027free sugars\u0027. These are the sugars added to food and drinks, found in biscuits, chocolate, breakfast cereals and fizzy drinks. But they are also found naturally in honey and unsweetened fruit juices.“We found that for people with overweight or obesity, if they also got the brief counselling discussion, they showed significant reductions in their lipid levels as well. So for heavier people, the extra attention really mattered to them. They benefited the most,” said Epel.Laura Schmidt, a co-author of the study, said the permanent ban on sugary drinks sales at UCSF was an obvious move. “These days, most of what we are treating in our healthcare system is chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancers and Alzheimer’s. All of these conditions can be linked back to the calorie-dense, nutritionally poor standard western diet”, she said. “It made sense for a health sciences campus like UCSF to say no to profiting off the sales of products that cause the very diseases we treat in our hospitals and clinics.”Aseem Malhotra, an NHS consultant cardiologist and professor of evidence-based medicine, said: “This latest research not only solidifies the evidence that the positive health impact of sugar reduction is independent of body weight, but that removing the sale of sugary drinks from the working environment is a key solution to combating diet-related disease amongst staff.Simon Stevens, the NHS chief executive, said: “Since the NHS first asked hospitals to reduce sales of sugary drinks we have removed over 32 million teaspoons of sugar – or the equivalent of around 900,000 cans of fizzy pop.“Obesity is a dangerous public health threat, leading to a string of serious illnesses for millions, with thousands of people ending up in hospital as a result, so every industry needs to take a look at what it can do to support urgent action like reducing sales of sugary drinks to prevent harm and safeguard children.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce8966c127a79390328f092c4a1a5a47a75565b7/0_105_5068_3041/master/5068.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeff1cbb93ab406d079e98fdd191e8c2","title":"have you experienced weekend loneliness share your experiences","story":"If you’re single and struggle with weekend loneliness, we’d like to hear from you We’d like to understand more about whether weekend loneliness is on the rise among single people and especially in big cities where it can be harder to feel a sense of community.

Through his own hard work he has been given that chance. I am very proud of him.”If circumstances had played out differently, it might have been Ben lining up against South Africa on Saturday. In 2017, he was picked on the bench for an England XV to face the Barbarians before the tour of Argentina, only for a back injury to lead to his withdrawal and for Tom, his younger brother by 90 minutes, to take his place.Ben insists there is no part of him that wishes he could sneak into his brother’s England jersey on Saturday. “I am going out there solely to support him and England,” he says. “As a family we support each other in whatever we do, whether its an under-15 final or one of the biggest stages in sport.”The brothers have come through the system at Sale Sharks, and Ben is full of praise for the club’s director of rugby, Steve Diamond, and especially his willingness to bring through young players. “If you give that trust to young players, most of the time they give that back,” he says. “Diams has done really well both to develop players and give them the opportunity to succeed. Because if you don’t give them the opportunity they can’t take it.”It was Diamond who agreed that Curry should be allowed to travel to Yokohama on Tuesday – which means the flanker will miss Sale’s Premiership game at Bristol Bears on Friday – because he felt it was the right thing to do.“I massively appreciate what he and Sale have done,” said Curry. “It just shows how much of a family-orientated club this is. I don’t think many others would have done it. It’s a privilege it is to be part of this club.”The brothers are clearly close, and still share a house near Altrincham – one that Ben insists is now much tidier in his brother’s absence. “Since he’s been away I’ve also got two cats, which he is looking forward to meeting, but apart from that nothing has really changed,” he says.“We have lived together for 21 years now – you kind of get bored with each other. It’s nice to spend some time out of each other’s back pockets.”It is clear the competitive fires still burn between them – whether its on the PlayStation or the pitch. “When I was younger I bashed him at Fifa. And I’m better at table tennis, golf, swimming … and rugby,” he says, smiling.In four years’ time at the next World Cup in France he intends to be playing with Tom in England’s back row. “I am very fortunate to be part of Tom’s journey, and to be close to it, but the drive from every back‑rower is the same,” says Ben. “We are all desperate to play in that shirt.“So I have to continue to develop each day and when Tom does come back to learn from him. Because he is one of the best players in the world right now. Why wouldn’t I want to emulate him, and learn from what he is doing?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36ab7a046e499c9d8d0a4f2cfbab13bfc2eedf04/0_67_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cd73462303348fd52f3d16b85f8aa0b","title":"mark cavendish cycling sunset years champagne","story":"Amid the lights and noise – loud music, louder cheering – of the Six Days of London meeting, Mark Cavendish rediscovered what winning feels like. This was not the sunlit splendour of the Champs Élysées, where he triumphed in the climactic stage of the Tour de France four years in a row with the eyes of the world on him. It was the very different environment of the Lee Valley VeloPark velodrome, where the crowd’s hot breath is on a rider’s neck as he circles an infernal oval for lap after lap, calculating strategies while trying to retain enough energy for a final lung-scorching sprint.By the time the event wound up on Sunday night, Cavendish and his riding partner, the Welshman Owain Doull, were not on the top step of the podium. They had been pipped for victory in the general classification by Elia Viviani and Simone Consonni. But earlier in the week’s points-gathering programme they had won the 40-lap Derny races on Tuesday and Thursday nights, the Madisons on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, the team elimination races on Thursday and Saturday and the 60-lap Derny final on Sunday, in which Cavendish swept past Viviani and the Australian sprint ace Caleb Ewan in the final 50 metres to take the win.In the last race, a massively intense hour-long Madison final, Cavendish failed to catch Consonni in the penultimate sprint by a couple of millimetres before Viviani took the hand-sling to burn off Doull and take the points that gave the Italians the overall title. But after a three-year nightmare of illness and injury, it was no surprise Cavendish looked practically radiant as he and his teammate sprayed champagne from the second tier of the winners’ podium.The week had also been punctuated by another bit of encouraging news for the 34-year-old when it was announced that on 1 January he will be joining Bahrain-Merida, the World Tour squad whose team principal, Rod Ellingworth, nurtured Cavendish’s talent during his days as the head of the British Olympic cycling programme’s academy. In 2011 Ellingworth, a brilliant coach, was the chief strategist of the British team when Cavendish won the world road race championship in Copenhagen, the rider’s day of days.After spending most of his glory years with the Highroad, Team Sky and Quickstep squads, Cavendish joined the Dimension Data team in 2016. As he entered his 30s, the move to a South Africa-based team, even as the squad’s designated leader, seemed like a step down. Perhaps the edge had gone from the double-kick that a sprinter needs to demolish the competition at the highest level perhaps a new generation had outpaced him.His answer, unforgettably, was to win four stages of that year’s Tour de France, beginning on the opening day at Utah beach in Normandy with a victory that put him in the yellow jersey for a day. Those four wins took him to a total of 30 stage victories in the Tour: the highest ever for a pure sprinter and only four behind Eddy Merckx, generally regarded as the greatest rider in the sport’s history. Three months earlier, back in the Great Britain jersey, he and Bradley Wiggins won the Madison title at the world championships in London, resuming a partnership that had disintegrated in acrimony during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.But then, at the start of his second season with Dimension Data, disaster struck in the form of a medical diagnosis. Cavendish had contracted the Epstein-Barr virus, a deep-lying condition that affects the immune system and can lower the body’s defences against glandular fever and other debilitating illnesses. He recovered sufficiently to start the Tour that summer but a tangle at the end of stage four with Peter Sagan, one of the pretenders to his standing as the world’s pre-eminent sprinter, left him on the floor with a fractured shoulder blade.Three more nasty crashes at the start of 2018 – at the Tour of Abu Dhabi, Tirreno-Adriatico and Milan-San Remo – resulted in shoulder and rib damage and ruined his preparation for the Tour, which he abandoned at half-distance after finishing outside the time limit on a short but brutal mountain stage to La Rosière. That August the symptoms of the Epstein-Barr virus were spotted again and his season was over.Worse, in a way, than illness and injury was the decision by Dimension Data’s chief, Doug Ryder, to leave him out of the 2019 Tour team, against the advice of his sporting director, the former sprint champion Rolf Aldag. Cavendish could only watch on in impotent fury as, without him, the team failed to win a single stage.As yet no one knows whether Ellingworth has the qualities required to make a successful transition from sporting director to team principal, although his years at Dave Brailsford’s side will at least have shown him what the job entails. It is now his responsibility to ensure one of the greatest British sporting figures of the current millennium brings his career to an appropriate close. No small task but one that should be worth watching."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69757b7b64d408c15a14e0faf95da8f8aa407d7e/0_35_4738_2842/master/4738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48318805413a1a910b34f62aa543c333","title":"tiger woods japan zozo championship japan golf","story":"We may never know the extent to which Tiger Woods really values matching the record for PGA Tour victories. Whereas now, quite understandably, the haul of 82 achieved decades earlier by Sam Snead is uppermost in golf’s vernacular, it is the figure of 18 – the number of Jack Nicklaus’s major wins – that has always seemed to be Woods’s barometer.What can be said without fear of contradiction is that Woods’s latest success, achieved by three shots at the Zozo Championship in Japan on Monday morning, adds to his extraordinary year. The 43-year-old indulged in sporting fairytale by winning his 15th major, the Masters, in April, upon return from the depths of physical despair. Woods cut a jaded figure during so many events thereafter, fuelling speculation about to what extent his Augusta glory had impacted both physically and mentally. When news broke of a fifth knee surgery, as undertaken in August, it seemed as if Woods’s career was again heading for neutral gear.Not so. Woods comfortably held off Hideki Matsuyama to claim a trophy from an 11th different country as a professional. Snead was 52 when he won his last PGA Tour title.“I probably thought about the record when I got north of 50, but then unfortunately I went through some rough patches with my back and didn’t play for a number of years, so that record seemed like it was out of reach,” Woods said. “Having had my fourth back procedure and being able to come back and play at a decently high level again, it put the number back in the conversation again. Lo and behold, here we are tied.“As far as playing until 52, I hope that’s the case. If you would have asked me a few years ago, I would have given you a different answer, but certainly the future looks brighter than it has. The body can’t do what it used to but I can still think my way around the golf course.”Woods complied rounds of 64, 64, 66 and 67 to reach the 19-under par total sufficient to keep home hero Matsuyama, three shots behind, and the remainder of a stellar field at bay. Rory McIlroy recovered admirably from an opening 72 to share third at 13 under. “Stressful,” was the adjective Woods used to describe his feat albeit he is still to be overhauled when holding at least a three-shot lead with 18 holes to play.“This week was a good sign for the future,” Woods added. “Hopefully I can be as consistent as Sam was, well into my 40s and early 50s.“It’s satisfying to dig my way out of it and figure out a way. There were some hard times trying to figure it out but I’ve come back with different games over the years, moving patterns and this one’s been obviously the most challenging. Then having another procedure a couple months ago and again coming back and winning an event? Not easy to do.”The PGA Tour’s commercial department will need scraping from the ceiling. The first staging of this tournament, in Chiba, drew massive crowds with even the delayed finish owing to storm disruption not impacting on the topic on everybody’s lips. It helps the Tour, of course, to have strong interest in Japan and a global spotlight on Woods making records in the here and now. Tiger remains very good for business, long after so many had written him off. An endearing photo, of Snead signing an autograph for a very young Woods was circulated via the Tour’s social media channels as the dust settled in Japan.Effusive analysis arrived from Woods’s fellow players. “His ball striking was a joke his distance control was something I’ve never seen,” said Gary Woodland, who partnered Woods during rounds one and two in Japan. “He looked like the best player in the world. It was impressive to watch.” Woods has actually now risen to No 6 in the world rankings.Woods still has captaincy duties for the US team at the President’s Cup to perform before rounding off his 2019. In what provides a further nod towards the cash register – albeit there is now competitive reasoning – it would be a surprise if he doesn’t name himself as a wildcard pick.“Once he gets that confidence up, he’s tough to beat,” said Woods’s caddie, Joe LaCava. More than five months are still to run before Woods begins his Masters defence. The wait feels like a form of sporting cruelty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/397bf406519c4ac82dd0f7bb90ca8ebb5cbc1897/0_89_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d61be573accf7f3c7cf65d1ac8203411","title":"bianca andreescu v simona halep wta finals 2019 live","story":"Simona Halep claimed a brilliant win in a gripping match against Bianca AndreescuThat’s all from me today, but what a fun, physical first meeting that was between Halep and Andreescu. The youngster burst through and shone bright, but the veteran showed why she is where she is. Hopefully this is the first of many meetings between them. I’ll be back tomorrow for Osaka-Barty and Kvitova-Bencic. Until then.Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) 3-6 Halep: Simona Halep snatches a brilliant win in a gripping match. Andreescu was sublime for the first set, showing her full blinding arsenal of shots but that match was a measure of how tough Halep is to beat when she wants to these days. Many players can hit through her for a set and a bit, but can you do it across three sets?You have to hope that Andreescu’s back is okay. Despite losing, the set she won bodes well for the rest of the round robin tournament.Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) *3-5 Halep: Well, well, well. Simona Halep will serve for the victory. Andreescu looks completely spent and Halep is still grinding her down with every shot of every long rally. A wicked dipping crosscourt forehand passing shot from Halep at 30-30 before another long rally forced the break.Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) *3-4 Halep: Andreescu doesn’t need to look in great shape to win tennis matches though. Too many puffball second serves from Halep, and Andreescu is able to shorten the points. She finishes with a wicked crosscourt forehand return winner and here we are. Back on serve.Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) *2-4 Halep: Halep is doing some insane things on defence at the moment. At 15-15, she chases down a couple of sizzling Andreescu backhands, before snapping a backhand crosscourt winner of her own. Then she anticipates correctly on a backhand putaway from the Canadian and drills the passing shot crosscourt. She breaks with a solid defensive lob, with Andreescu dumping the smash into the net.Andreescu doesn’t look good right now.Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) *2-3 Halep: Simona Halep recovers from 0-30 down to move up in the third set. A solid service game sealed with a great wrong-footing forehand winner.Meanwhile, Andreescu has the trainer out again for her back. She certainly isn’t moving well at the moment.Here is one such ridiculous shot from Andreescu.Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) 2-2* Halep: It must be noted that Halep did indeed move forward… and she shanked the drive volley long on the second point of this game. However, Halep was solid enough to get the break by taking an Andreescu moonball early and crushing a forehand winner.Weird play from Andreescu right now. She’s just going for everything and rolling through her vast arsenal without much thought. Some absolutely insane winners are coming from her racquet, but also plenty of errors.Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) *2-1 Halep: Again, we have seen Andreescu recover after looking down and out so frequently this year. Those errors from Halep have awoken the beast:Andreescu snapped a breathtaking forehand return winner at full stretch from 0-15, then she pushed Halep back with moonballs before stepping in and snapping a forehand winner at 15-15. At 15-40, Andreescu hit a brilliant dropshot and did just enough with the forehand passing shot to take the game.Darren Cahill is back on and he is practically begging Halep to move into the court and take on more drive volleys. We’ll see if she does.Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) 1-1* Halep: That was… unimpressive from Simona Halep. Andreescu was spraying errors to move down 15-30 and still looked extremely shaky, but Halep went for two low percentage shots at full stretch, spraying a forehand wide and then a backhand into the net. Andreescu holds.Final set: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) *0-1 Halep: Andreescu looks quite weary and is trying to shorten points even more than earlier, but we’ve seen this many times before from Andreescu yet she has only lost 5 matches this year. Halep is more than happy to see more unforced errors and edges ahead.Andreescu is taking a medical timeout for her backhip now. Second set tiebreak: Andreescu 6-3 6-7(6) Halep: Simona Halep saves a match point to force Andreescu to a third set! The level is sky-high here, with Halep’s defence just making the difference in the tiebreak. She retrieved so many defensive shots with quality and depth, and forced Andreescu into going for too much. The set ended with a wild second serve return from Andreescu. This has been an experience.Second set tiebreak: Andreescu 6-3 6-6 (6-7*) Halep: Some absolutely immense defence from Simona Halep to build up a *6-4 lead, but she misses a bold down the line forehand at 6-4. Andreescu saves the second set point with a forehand volley winner. Another set point coming up for Halep though...Second set tiebreak: Andreescu 6-3 6-6 (3-3) Halep: Halep suddenly looked like the calmer player, moving up 3-0 in the tiebreak. But with her back against the wall, Andreescu snapped a huge forehand winner and came right back for 3-3. This is so tight.Second set: Andreescu 6-3 6-6 Halep: What a hold by Simona Halep! After immense pressure, copious dropshots and some brutal rallies won by the young Canadian, she brings up her first match point. Halep saves the match point with some brilliant defence before immediately flipping to offence and forcing an error with a great backhand crosscourt. Shortly after, Halep snaps a gutsy backhand down the line winner told hold again. Bold.Second set: Andreescu 6-3 6-5* Halep: An easy hold for Andreescu to pile the pressure back on the Romanian. She closed it off so impressively: she absolutely crushed a crosscourt forehand winner, then landed a delicate forehand dropshot as Halep braced herself far behind the baseline for another violent body blow, then closed with an unreturned first serve.Second set: Andreescu 6-3 *5-5 Halep: Halep gets herself back on track at just the right time. Some great depth from Halep, who painted the baseline a couple of times and forced errors out of Andreescu. This is very tight.Second set: Andreescu 6-3 5-4* Halep: Andreescu edges ahead and the Romanian will now serve to stay in the match. Wasteful from Halep, who twice had an easy short forehand to finish the point. She dumped the first into the net, then went straight back at Andreescu on the second, who rolled a backhand passing shot past her. Some solid serving from Andreescu and she is a game away.Second set: Andreescu 6-3 *4-4 Halep: Andreescu has a tendency to whack her shin with her racquet, and she has now drawn blood. But on-court, it was actually Halep who was bleeding errors in that game. Despite Cahill imploring her to attack her second serve ,it’s sitting up a little too much and Andreescu is taking advantage.Medical timeout for Andreescu to address her shin. Cahill is back on: “Stay in there mentally and don’t get down on yourself.”Second set: Andreescu 6-3 3-4* Halep: Andreescu pieces together a nice regulation hold, but a winning tweener at 30-0 stole the show. Rather than a bit of showboating, it seemed like Andreescu got a little tangled up, but when your hands are that good you can adjust.Coach Darren Cahill is on court for Halep. He’s very happy with her getting Andreescu on the move and opening up the court. He tells her to keep on trying to push the Canadian back with her second serve. We’ll see if she can.Second set: Andreescu 6-3 *2-4 Halep: This time, Simona Halep consolidates her break with a hold but that was tough. Halep moved up 40-0 and seemed to be coasting, but then Andreescu pieced together three great points, winning two long exchanges and snapping one great forehand return. But once again it’s Halep’s serve that keeps her out of trouble. Two unreturned first serves from deuce givers the Romanian a hold.Second set: Andreescu 6-3 2-3* Halep: Simona Halep’s tenaciousness has been impressive so far in set two. She is not controlling a lot of the play out here, but she continues to land returns deep, keep her consistent level and force Andreescu to put the ball past her frequently. She couldn’t this time, hitting three unforced errors for Halep to move up a break once more.Second set: Andreescu 6-3 *2-2 Halep: Andreescu’s weakness may be her concentration, but she is also so good at bouncing back. She gets the break back immediately. A slick angled drop volley at 0-30 from Andreescu, then she broke back with a stinging forehand crosscourt return.Second set: Andreescu 6-3 1-2* Halep: Andreescu’s one weakness this year has been her tendency to lose concentration and go off the boil a little during matches. A series of errors from Andreescu, including a double fault at 15-30, and a solid Simona Halep is up a break in set two.Second set: Andreescu 6-3 *1-1 Halep: You won’t see another service game like that from Simona Halep for a long, long time. The diminutive Romanian just held with two straight aces. She will take that every day of the week.Second set: Andreescu 6-3 1-0* Halep: Absolutely no let-up from Andreescu to start the second set. Halep spent a lot of time trying to break down the Canadian’s backhand, but Andreescu is so good at throwing in a loopy ball or a slice and finding a big forehand again. Let’s see if she can sustain this level.First set: Andreescu 6-3 Halep: That was quite an incredible set of tennis from Bianca Andreescu, who was absolutely dominant aside from one two-game stretch of excellence from the Romanian. Andreescu has dominated the exchanges, both by being the aggressor and constantly changing the pace. She’s throwing in loopy high balls, drop shots, you name it. Halep isn’t playing badly at all but she hasn’t been able to stay with the Canadian.First set: Andreescu 5-3* Halep: Andreescu throws down another love hold, this time sealed with an ace. Cahill suggested taking on her backhand down the line and going after the early balls a little more, but it’s so tough when Andreescu is putting her under this much pressure.Meanwhile, Coach Darren Cahill is back on-court with Halep. He was due to officially join her team again in the new season after taking a break this year, but clearly they just couldn’t wait.First set: Andreescu *4-3 Halep: The one constant so far has been Andreescu relentlessly attacking the Halep second serve. But after wasting two more break points, Andreescu mixes in a few slices and forces an error to break again.First set: Andreescu 3-3* Halep: No problems for Andreescu after losing two games in a row. She absolutely crushed a few forehands, landed some first serves and held to love.First set: Andreescu *2-3 Halep: Both women are starting to thrive now and the rallies are tough. Andreescu absolutely obliterated a couple of Halep’s serves to bring up 0-40, then Halep erased the danger with some quality counterpunching. Incredible work from Halep at deuce - she soaked up a series of big forehands, retrieved an Andreescu overhead and then immediately flipped the point, finishing with a forehand winner. First set: Andreescu 2-2* Halep: Well, it appears that Simona Halep has arrived. Some tough rallies end with Halep passing Andreescu at the net twice. First she easily retrieved an Andreescu dropshot, then held her ground and redirected a big Andreescu forehand past the Canadian at the net. High quality stuff.First set: Andreescu *2-1 Halep: Andreescu snatches the first break and she is already looking so sharp. Unsurprisingly, it’s the Canadian who is controlling most of these points early on and dictating the pace of the rallies. She hits a brilliant winning dropshot and then crushed a great inside-out forehand winner at 30-30. Halep isn’t dealing with her weight of shot well so far.First set: Andreescu 1-1* Halep: Andreescu levels up immediately, holding to 15. A couple of huge forehands from Andreescu, who is already serving big.First set: Andreescu *0-1 Halep: As expected, Andreescu us already showing off her variety. She opened the match by narrowly missing a volley the net, then slipped in a slick drop shot winner. Despite being pushed to deuce, Halep rallies out a deuce game to get her first hold.How will this match be won?Good question. The most striking part of Andreescu’s rise has been her style of play. She already possesses one of the biggest forehands in the world, she moves well, she returns extremely well and she can be really aggressive. But it’s her variety that has really set her apart she’ll throw in dropshots, loopy balls, net forays and she’ll try to break Halep’s rhythmHalep will have to soak up all of that pace and variety and she may look to move Andreescu with her angles. But this will be their first ever match-up so it will be fascinating to see how they try to outmanoeuvre and outthink each other.If Andreescu’s surname didn’t make it clear, the most notable aspect of this match-up is that Andreescu’s parents are Romanian. She spent some of her youth in Romania, speaks the language and proudly represents both parts of her heritage. Naturally, she considers Halep her idol.“Yeah, I just told her that she has to stop juniors because she’s strong enough to make the step,” said Halep“It’s amazing what she has done. To win a Grand Slam at 19, play few tournaments and win them, it’s a great, great job. I just want to tell her that she deserved because she played really well these tournaments.”Hello! Welcome to our coverage on day two of the WTA Finals in Shenzhen. The best eight players in 2019 will be battling throughout the week, and there are few better prospects than this upcoming battle between Bianca Andreescu and Simona Halep.No 4 Andreescu has been the sensation at the top of the game in 2019, breaking through in March with her title at Indian Wells as a wildcard, then stamping her spot at the top of the game when Angelique Keber infamously called her “the biggest drama queen ever”. After struggling with a bad shoulder injury, she only played one match the following four months. Upon her return, she immediately win the Rogers Cup at home in Canada before winning her first grand slam title at the US Open. Her win-loss record is an astounding 48-5.On the other hand, No 5 Simona Halep has been here before. This is her sixth(!) straight appearance at the WTA finals in 2014 and she has been by far the most consistent player in this period. This year she backed up last year’s cathartic, long awaited Roland Garros title by beating Serena Williams to win the Wimbledon title on her ‘worst’ surface. However, she has been struggling with a back injury recently. We’ll see if she’s up to it.This should be a good one, so please feel free to drop an email tumaini.carayol@the or tweet me at @tumcarayol."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc8adab034f2142f8541198812b8649fb298e5ec/386_576_3260_1956/master/3260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f726865402926094b03d699963d68431","title":"anupama chandrasekhar interview playwright shocking india ibsen","story":"Her dramas confront the growing horrors facing women in India today. Now she’s reworked Ibsen’s Ghosts, taking out the syphilis and putting in the Delhi bus gang rape of 2012Anupama Chandrasekhar isn’t one to shy away from a tough subject. The Indian playwright has written about acid attacks, sex tapes and her home country’s culture of patriarchal violence. “I have been asked so many times, mostly by men, ‘Why don’t you write comedies, or plays that celebrate India?’” she says. “I tell them: on the day that these things don’t happen any more, I will happily start writing bedroom farces.”Her latest play, When the Crows Visit, takes Ibsen’s Ghosts as its inspiration. This may seem something of a departure, but Chandrasekhar found a surprising degree of affinity within the drama. “Here is a white, male, Norwegian playwright from the 19th century,” she says, “and yet, as an Indian woman in Chennai in the 21st, I find so much resonance in his work.” It is a brilliantly creepy play, building up tension and horror through the crows that bridge the worlds of the living and the dead.There is one vital – and shocking – twist in her splicing of India with Ibsen. The original featured Mrs Alving and her syphilitic son Oswald, grappling with the awful disease handed down from his father. But in When the Crows Visit, the toxic inheritance comes in the form of sexual violence against women. What’s more, the mother figure, played by Ayesha Dharker, is both a victim of this violence and an enabler. One reference point in the play is the Delhi bus gang rape of 2012. Even though this takes place off stage, the horror is palpable, spreading through the script like a contagion.The play is directed by Indhu Rubasingham, artistic director at London’s Kiln theatre, and as the three of us sit in her attic office we talk about turning such inflammatory material into charged drama. It was imperative that the play be conceived by someone rooted in Indian society, says Rubasingham. “Anu’s not only a brilliant playwright – she is writing from a place of knowledge and lived experience. Immediately after I got this job, I wanted to commission her.”Chandrasekhar has an important reason to return to the Delhi rape. Sexual violence, she says, has become more rife in India since 2012, despite all the national and international hand-wringing that followed the case. “It was not a one-off incident. It has happened over and over again since, and has just become more gory, more brutal. But you can sense the media fatigue around the reporting of crimes against women. If it happens outside of the cities, it’s just another incident. The candlelit vigils don’t happen for women in small towns and villages.”The resurgence of violence in the country has coincided with the rebirth of its rightwing movement and this, says Chandrasekhar, is complicated by the conflict between modernity and conservatism. “Even 30 or 40 years ago, Indian women were growing up freer than girls are now. My grandmother is a pre-independence woman.” India gained its freedom from Britain in 1947. “She was brought up on the idealism that women are as important as men for the growth of the country. She sees what’s happening to the women around her and says, ‘What’s happened to that promise?’“You have polls in Tamil magazines debating what is an appropriate way for a woman to dress. Is it OK for them to wear joggers? Is sleeveless OK? You wonder which century you’re living in, but that’s the thing with India. We live in different centuries at the same time: the 21st and the 18th.”She feels that women’s rights are being reeled back around the world, not just in the subcontinent. But it is how this happens locally that interests her as a playwright. In India, the twin privileges of money and parental protection render some women safer than others. “The most disenfranchised in a lot of societies, not just India, are working-class women,” says Rubasingham. “The minute you have money and power behind you, you can get out of situations.”The women of privilege in Chandrasekhar’s play not only work alongside men in cities, often proving to be better at their jobs, but are also the enablers and protectors of the flawed and violent men around them. Female complicity is an ethically thorny area, I suggest. Was Chandrasekhar worried that the audience might end up blaming the women?“I, like Ibsen, am just trying to be faithful to my society’s dynamics,” she says. “I’m fascinated by how culture and patriarchy expresses itself in how women are supposed to behave – and I think Ibsen was too.”So was Ibsen grappling with “the woman question” as it was labelled in his time? Could he be considered a feminist playwright? And is that why we are seeing female directors and writers increasingly adapting his works? These have included Tanika Gupta, who recently relocated A Doll’s House to 19th-century India Cordelia Lynn, who turned Hedda Gabler into the far older Hedda Tesman and Rubasingham herself, who directed Samuel Adamson’s Wife, another reworking of A Doll’s House.“He was ahead of his time,” says Rubasingham. “What he was really writing about was the tension between the inidual and society. Just take A Doll’s House ­– a woman breaking all society norms and leaving her husband in that time was unheard of.” Chandrasekhar first read the play decades ago and its resonance has never left her. “To me, Ibsen’s up there with Shakespeare, because it doesn’t matter which era or what culture you are living in, you find him speaking to you as a contemporary.”Despite her love of literature as a young woman, Chandrasekhar came to playwriting circuitously. She started off as a news journalist but ended up on a business publication, dissatisfied by its focus on money and restrictive language. Yet it was this background in reporting that fed her social conscience when she began writing plays. After doing a part-time British Council course in Chennai, she got a fellowship at London’s Royal Court and her career was born in earnest. “I saw people my age doing important things and saw how important they felt their voices were to their own countries. I felt I could be part of this. I could matter.”Her first – and much celebrated – UK play was 2007’s Free Outgoing, which dramatised the insidious power of the internet, as a teenager’s sex tape is circulated around her school in Chennai (or Madras, as the capital city of Tamil Nadu state was formerly known). The same year in India, Acid was staged by the Madras Players, featuring the horrific titular attacks on women. Then came Disconnect, again set in Chennai – this time in a call centre that collects credit card debt – which revolves around a young call centre worker who becomes romantically fixated on a debt-ridden librarian in Illinois.Her work has not been cancelled or gatecrashed by the police, but she is constantly under pressure to tone it down or remove its contentions. Yet she resists. There is certainly a rising generation of bold young women writers in India, she says, even if they are not all playwrights – but #MeToo is not having the same impact it had in the west. “For instance, a Tamil singer outed a very famous lyricist and you’d think that the whole of society would support her. It didn’t. She has been banned by the industry and he’s doing the things he always did. Her career has been destroyed. She’s not the only person you see this happening to. Women are speaking, but they are being punished for it. This is the difference.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65a644778901c66e5a1aa0e96a1f00b7859ae602/147_72_2651_1591/master/2651.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94455449a8bfe599b04a4efcd824da27","title":"airpods pro apple launches noise cancelling earbuds","story":"New silicone tips, noise cancelling and transparency modes in a similar designApple has launched a new set of its popular true wireless earbuds with traditional silicone tips and noise-cancelling software.The AirPods Pro have a similar design to the current non-isolating AirPods, complete with white stalks and an ultra-compact case. But instead of a plastic duct that rests in your ear, allowing sounds from the outside world to be heard over music, the AirPods Pro aim to block it all out.Earlier AirPods, or Apple’s wired EarPods before them, are practically impossible to hear on noisy public transport. That means users often crank up the volume to potentially hearing-damaging levels, while risking annoying those around them with sound bleeding from their ears due to the lack of isolation.Apple hopes the AirPods Pro will solve that problem. Like other noise-cancelling headphones, the new earbuds have a pair of microphones on each unit that detect unwanted noise and use the speakers to cancel it out with an inverse soundwave before it hits the wearer’s eardrum. That lets users hear their music at significantly lower volumes in noisy environments.A “transparency mode” allows wearers to pipe sounds from the outside world into their ears, while vents equalise pressure to avoid the plugged-in feeling.The AirPods Pro also have adaptive equaliser technology that tunes the sound to the shape of the inidual’s ear.The earbuds have up to five hours of continuous playback time – 4.5 hours with noise-cancelling active – and the case can provide an additional 18 hours of charging. They also support hands-free “Hey Siri” activation for Apple’s voice assistant, and can announce messages when they arrive on an iPhone. The earbuds are also sweat-resistant. The AirPods Pro cost £249 in the UK or $249 in the US, and ship on 30 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a330ffbbc44dcbbdec8b3661283f94a6ffb0a162/46_60_1061_637/master/1061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a4e0c3afb0f61ad27ae490a8f9384d","title":"instagram extend ban images self harm cartoons","story":"Move follows appeal by father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who killed herself in 2017Instagram is to extend its ban on depictions of self-harm to cover cartoons and drawings, following an appeal from Ian Russell, whose 14-year-old daughter, Molly, killed herself in 2017.Molly had been looking at graphic content relating to suicide and self-harm before she died, her father discovered, prompting him to go public earlier this year and campaign against the platform’s rules that allowed that material.Instagram had already banned graphic images of self-harm in February, following Ian Russell’s protests, and the company says it will extend that ban to unrealistic yet explicit depictions of suicide, and images that “promote” self-harm.“It will take time to fully implement,” Instagram’s Adam Mosseri, the head of the Facebook subsidiary, told BBC News, “but it’s not going to be the last step we take. There is still very clearly more work to do. This work never ends.” Speaking about his daughter, Russell told the BBC: “I think Molly probably found herself becoming depressed. She was always very self-sufficient and liked to find her own answers. I think she looked towards the internet to give her support and help. She may well have received support and help, but what she also found was a dark, bleak world of content that accelerated her towards more such content.”He said the algorithms used by some online platforms “push similar content towards you” based on what you have been looking at.He said: “I think Molly entered that dark rabbit hole of depressive suicidal content. Some were as simple as little cartoons – a black and white pencil drawing of a girl that said: ‘Who would love a suicidal girl?’ Some were much more graphic and shocking.”Andy Burrows, the head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, said the move did not change the fact that the industry as a whole was irresponsible, and called on the government to progress legislation intended to impose a duty of care on social media platforms.“Molly’s death should be a galvanising moment to act,” Burrows said, “but the reality is while Instagram has taken positive steps the rest of the tech industry has been slow to respond – on self-harm, suicide and other online harms.“As Ian Russell says there is a pressure of time and there is a price for not moving quickly enough, which is children’s lives. That is why the government needs to introduce a draft bill to introduce the duty of care regulator by next Easter and commit to ensuring it tackles all the most serious online threats to children.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c17b6944bfd55a04eed306570eab25abbb8201c4/133_262_4318_2590/master/4318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f2a151afc6cd9077efabfe911283273","title":"dafne keen his dark materials lyra bbc philip pullman","story":"Facing down fascists in the BBC’s Philip Pullman adaptation is child’s play for an actor whose improv left Wolverine speechless. The prodigy talks jellyfish, religion and her night out with Lin-Manuel MirandaDafne Keen does not much look like Lyra Belacqua, at least not as Philip Pullman describes her in His Dark Materials. In Northern Lights, the first book of the trilogy, she is “like a half-wild cat”, with dirty fingernails, green eyes and grubby blond-ish hair. Keen, who is half British, half Spanish and lives in Madrid, is darker and is already the master of an intense glare, as anyone who saw her alongside Hugh Jackman in the Wolverine swansong Logan will know. When we meet, in a London hotel, she has the self-possessed cool of a total pro, even at 14. But there are plenty of Lyra-esque flourishes that make it obvious why she got the part.She was almost 12 when she finished filming Logan. She had heard about the BBCHBO adaptation of His Dark Materials, then in its early stages, and sent in an audition tape. But she didn’t hear back. “I thought, never mind, I’ll just carry on with my life,” she says. “Which is when I got stung by the jellyfish.” The production team had finally replied, asking her to make another tape. Keen was on holiday in Puerto Rico. “I thought, right, I’m going to have a chilled-out swim and then I’m going to get ready. I suddenly felt this thing on my face and then it started stinging and then it expanded all over my face. I ran to my mum and I went, ‘Mum! Is it really red?’ My mum went, ‘No it’s fine.’ And then she went, ‘Oh no, it’s not fine.’” Her face was red and swollen but she had to do the tape. “So my audition is with a jelly-face,” she smiles.The next step was to meet Ruth Wilson, who plays Mrs Coulter, one of the best evil characters in children’s literature. “I was sitting in the waiting room with 20 other girls,” Keen remembers. “I was thinking, oh god, they’re all blond. I don’t physically look like this character, and these girls all do. I went in, shook hands with Ruth, and five minutes later, she looked at me and said, ‘You know, you have the same eyebrows as me.’” Fans of the books will know that this is a big thumbs up. Days later, she began rehearsals, with Wilson and puppets. In Pullman’s books, people have daemons, an animal manifestation of their “inner self”, which lives alongside them. Because the daemons on screen are CGI, the actors shot their scenes with puppets to make their interactions as authentic as possible.Naturally, Keen is practised at describing what her own daemon would be, were this world to have daemons in it. “Mine is quite easy to figure out, because it’s what everyone called me on set. Everyone calls me Monkey.” In the books, daemons change form until their human reaches adulthood, when they settle as one fixed animal. Keen particularly liked hers as a pine marten.We meet the morning after the world premiere of His Dark Materials, which was the first time Keen had watched it. “Everybody had seen it apart from me! I’m really busy filming season two, so I had no time to watch it. I had Philip Pullman right next to me, and I was like, oh god! But I think he liked it.” Did he offer his approval? “His wife came up to me and was really lovely and was saying I was the perfect Lyra. I was really happy to hear that.”Keen had not read the trilogy before she auditioned. “Now I’m a massive, massive fan. As soon as I read the books, I knew this was a good message to the world, and it’s important that we have stories about young girls, because there aren’t many,” she says. At the premiere, Jack Thorne, who wrote the screenplay, likened Lyra to Greta Thunberg. Though she does not know it, the future of the world rests on Lyra’s shoulders, and she has to fight tooth and nail to defeat the forces that wish to suppress free will and independent thought. Keen approves of the Thunberg comparison. “I am genuinely in awe of that girl.”There have been various adaptations of His Dark Materials over the years: a Radio 4 series, a play at the National Theatre and the 2007 Hollywood attempt, The Golden Compass, with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. It was supposed to be a trilogy, but only the first was made – and Pullman’s theme of an abusive authoritarian religious body was watered down almost beyond recognition. The television series seems more comfortable with its source material, and its Magisterium, the governing body of the Church, is portrayed as a fascist regime.In 2007, the Catholic League called for a boycott of The Golden Compass, despite the religious references being excised, and the Vatican also denounced the film and Pullman’s writing. Keen had seen it – was she aware that this new version might be controversial, given the backlash the movie attracted? “I thought that was sad, but I understand why they had to do it,” she reasons, diplomatically, of the decision to soften the book’s themes. “But I think people are reading too much into it. When Philip writes about the Magisterium, he’s not bringing down the church, he’s bringing down the system.”Keen was born and raised in Spain and is bilingual. Her mother María is Spanish, and as well as being her acting coach is also an actor, as is Keen’s father Will. He has a part in His Dark Materials, as Father MacPhail, part of the Magisterium faithful. “He is terrifying,” says Keen. “He always plays bad people. I don’t know why because he’s so nice. I genuinely think it’s because he’s bald and has green eyes.” She practically grew up in a theatre rehearsal room, because of her parents, but she thought she would be a biologist, like David Attenborough. “Then I found out you have to study biology, and to do that you have to study maths, and I went, mmm no, I’m not doing that. I hate maths so much, you can’t even imagine.”A friend of her mother’s was making a short film, and needed a child for it, so Keen gave acting a go. She loved it. She did a series in Spain, The Refugees, alongside her father. (“He was playing my evil father, yes. Always got to give it the psychopathic twist.”) She picked up an agent, who put her forward for Logan, and she got down to an audition with Jackman. “In the waiting room, once again, there was this perfect LA beautiful blond girl. I was just, like, a small, scrappy Latin girl. I always think it’s not going to work out for me, and then it went really great.” She auditioned with Jackman, then asked if she could try again, only this time she said she’d like to improvise the scene. She was 11. “My heart was beating big time,” she says. “I thought, I’m just going to e in and ask them, and they loved it, so I was lucky.”Right now, Keen is preparing to go back to Wales to film season two, which loosely adapts The Subtle Knife, the second book in the trilogy. The third season, which will take on the astonishingly ambitious The Amber Spyglass, may take a little longer to pull together. Still, she is happy to live as Lyra for a while yet. She has taken plenty of her away from the experience already. “She taught me to speak up. Be bold, be brave, be yourself. Don’t follow rules, because rules can be useful, but they can be very stupid and pointless,” she says – sounding very much like her Lyra herself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d869231e30e08b0d74f3e987aad8ab84ddb4479a/0_5_1628_977/master/1628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a676c70e47d100e60487a2e5a162952e","title":"matteo salvinis coalition sweeps to power in umbria elections","story":"Alliance led by far right ends 50 years of leftwing rule in central Italian regionA coalition led by the far-right former interior minister Matteo Salvini has swept to power in the central Italian region of Umbria, ending 50 years of leftwing rule and further shaking the resilience of the national government.Salvini has bounced back after his League party was ejected from office in August after his failed attempt to bring about snap general elections. Its former partner, the Five Star Movement (M5S), then went into coalition with the centre-left Democratic party (PD).Elections in Umbria, a hilly region with a population of about 900,000, were brought forward by a year after Catiuscia Marini of the PD was forced to resign as president in April amid an investigation into the manipulation of entrance exams for staff at a hospital in Perugia.Salvini’s coalition campaigned heavily as it seized on the scandal as well as the PD’s neglect of areas of the region that were affected by earthquakes in 2016.But as the trio celebrated what Salvini hailed “a historical feat”, the mood in the hilltop town of Orvieto was despondent on Monday morning, with voters saying they had been faced with “a choice between thieves and haters”.Orvieto, for years a communist stronghold, had already been ided after the Salvini coalition’s candidate, Roberta Tardani, won mayoral elections in May. One of her first moves was to ban African immigrants from begging for money on the streets, with a Nigerian man arrested and prohibited from returning to the town for three years.Salvini has visited Orvieto three times since Tardani’s election, joking that he would like to move there.Much of the Salvini coalition’s campaigning in Umbria contained the usual mix of anti-immigrant, anti-gay rhetoric and religious symbolism. Giorgia Meloni, the leader of Brothers of Italy, took a selfie outside Orvieto’s gothic cathedral on Friday and posted it on social media alongside the message: “Someone will be shocked, but I repeat: we will continue to defend God, the homeland and the family. Also in Umbria”.“It was no surprise that they won,” said Elisabetta Spallaccia, a shop owner in Orvieto. “I’ve always been a leftwing voter and while I voted for the PD I was very sceptical about supporting them again. I cannot tolerate what the rightwing parties say but can understand why there was a vote for change.

Photograph: EPAPATRICK SEEGEREU ambassadors have agreed to accept the UK’s request for a Brexit “flextension” until January 31st 2020, European Council president Donald Tusk has said.Just three days before the United Kingdom was due to leave the EU on October 31st at 11pm, the bloc agreed to delay the deadline by three months or until the UK parliament ratify the deal.The UK will be allowed time to have a general election ahead of Brexit and may leave the EU on the 1st of any month until that date once the withdrawal agreement is ratified by the CommonsMr Johnson, who won the top job by pledging – “do or die” – to deliver Brexit on October 31st, was forced by opponents to request a delay after he was defeated in parliament over the sequencing of the ratification of his orce deal.Written procedureFormally speaking, the ambassadors set in train the “written procedure” for approval of decisions by leaders in the absence of a a full summit. That will happen after the UK signals its acceptance of the extension, likely to be through its ambassador to the EU, and is expected to be completed without difficulty within 24 hours.The UK had previously been granted an extension to Friday, and is required under the terms of its Benn Act to accept the EU’s offer of extension to January 31st unless the Commons votes it down.The agreed delay comes ahead of crucial votes in the UK Commons on Monday on proposals from the government and opposition Liberal Democrats to call a general election in December. Labour, whose vote would be crucial to the government motion, has been waiting until the EU spelled out the precise duration of any extension.But reports from London suggest that the government may circumvent the need for a two-thirds majority on its motion by backing a Liberal Democrat amendment to the Fixed Term Parliament Act setting December 9th as a date for the election.Simple majorityThat would require only a simple majority. If it does,\u0026nbspLabour’s position becomes moot.However, the general election would take place before any vote on the withdrawal bill,\u0026nbspraising the prospect that a new government could seek to renegotiate it.Although Mr Johnson would prefer to fight an election having secured Brexit, the Tories remain well ahead in the pollsBrexit has already been delayed twice – from March 29th and April 12th – after Mr Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, failed to get her deal through the British parliament.‘Averts risk’The Government welcomed the decision of the EU27 countries to grant another Brexit extension to the UK.“This averts the risk of a disruptive no deal Brexit,” said a Government spokesman. “The decision extends the deadline to the end of January but allows for an earlier exit by the UK if ratification is completed quickly.“We hope the extra time will be used to ensure that the withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU27 is ratified, enabling an orderly Brexit.”Fianna Fáil’s Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said that “more time” being created by the extension was welcome.“It prolongs the uncertainty, but it’s better than a crash out,” she tweeted.She said that “we have no idea” when a British general election will take place “or what it will throw up,” but warned that the next end of January deadline “won’t be long coming around.”Sources close to the Elysee confirmed over the weekend that France’s president Emmanuel Macron had accepted that the increased likelihood of an election in the UK had made his opposition to a three month extension less tenable.

His strict security made it impossible to communicate with supporters, aside from his sporadic and brief audio messages.Nor, by all accounts, was he involved in any of the group\u0027s day-to-day operations. The loss of Isil’s territory in March stripped him of the last of the trappings of his self-appointed role of caliph and made him little more than a fugitive in the desert.Indeed, reports circulating earlier this year suggested Isil had already chosen a potential successor, Abdullah Qardash, a former officer in Saddam Hussein’s army who quickly rose through Islamic State’s ranks.He first met Baghdadi, an Iraqi national whose real name was Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali Muhammad al-Badri al-Samarrai, while they were held by US forces in Camp Bucca detention centre in Basra over their links to al-Qaeda in 2003. It was there that Baghdadi forged close alliances with Qardash and a handful of other inmates, while refining his vision for the so-called caliphate.Qardash, who was born and studied Islamic studies in Iraq’s second city of Mosul, was nicknamed the “Professor” and the “Destroyer” and was recognised as a cruel and authoritarian leader within Isil.Whatever plans were being hashed out by Isil’s new leadership on the ground, in Washington US President Donald Trump was declaring it a “good day” for America.Reaction was more muted in the Middle East, where Isil’s victims continue to suffer the fallout of their terrifying five-year-reign. For them, the death of Baghdadi has not heralded a new, safer era. The US has killed the man, but not the ideology.Isil reportedly selected a successor to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi earlier this yearBaghdadi tapped into a sense of Sunni grievance against the Shia and Alawite-led governments in Syria and Iraq, one that still continues to burn.“My concern is that Americans will think, from listening to Trump’s speech, that his job is done, that Daesh has been defeated,” said Tobias Ellwood, Conservative MP and former defence minister. “That simply isn’t true. We’ve seen Isis flags popping up again in places they had been chased out. We have no post-conflict strategy and it is absolutely not job done.“I’m afraid the region will only see extremism continue to grow.”Isil has already returned to its insurgent roots. In its former territory in eastern Syria and western Iraq, it carries out near-weekly sleeper cell attacks and suicide bombings.The main force that had been battling them in Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces, were abandoned by the US earlier this month to continue that battle alone.Tens of thousands of devout followers held in prisons and detention camps in north-east Syria are waiting to regroup.Talk to any of the women in al-Hol detention camp and they will tell you they are waiting for the men to return for them and “reinstate the caliphate”. They see this period of “hardship” as simply a test from God of their commitment to the cause.“Baqiya,” they shout, the Arabic word for “remaining” – a reference to the Isil slogan “remaining and expanding”.The Queen\u0026#39s informal photoshoot that aides feared would \u0026#39bring down the monarchy\u0026#39Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson to put forward bill \u0026#39almost identical\u0026#39 to Lib Dems and SNP if tonight\u0026#39s election vote failsKeith Vaz should be suspended for six months over cocaine scandal, says MPs\u0026#39 standards watchdog The Queen\u0026#39s informal photoshoot that aides feared would \u0026#39bring down the monarchy\u0026#39Andrew Griggs guilty of murdering pregnant wife, Debbie, who disappeared 20-years ago without traceComment: Homeopathy may be bunkum, but we won\u0026#39t change believers\u0026#39 minds by arguing with themRSPB sends task force to remote Atlantic Island to tackle giant mice which eat albatross chicks aliveJapanese family appear in court charged with preventing lawful burial of relative found dead in house in North YorkshirePope criticised by child sex abuse inquiry after Vatican refuses to send crucial evidenceComment: Jeremy Corbyn has turned the next general election into a series of impossible demands\tCambridge graduate drowned in swimming pool after \u0026#39holding his breath contest\u0026#39Comment: The RSPB knows the benefits shooting brings for the birds they love – they\u0026#39re just too scared of their members to admit it Hong Kong falls into recession after five months of protest, finance secretary saysDoes Cambodia have a safety problem?Belgium names first female prime minister to lead caretaker governmentLee Rigby killer punched Broadmoor nurse after being asked to turn down the televisionMonday evening news briefing: Boost for election hopes even as MPs expected to reject motionFrance mosque shooting: Man in his 80s arrested after two shot in BayonneWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/16/airpods.jpg","title":"airpods pro apple explained tips size sound adaptive eq features","story":"Log in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Apple\u0027s new AirPods Pro will scan the inside of your ears when you wear them.While the headline feature of the new earphones is their ability to block out sound with a new noise cancelling feature, it also includes a variety of different features that are intended to improve the sound you hear, too.The first one that users will see is what Apple calls the Ear Tip Fit Test. That is used to ensure that the tips on the end of each AirPod Pro fit properly, and that they are sitting snug in your ear.It does so by using advanced algorithms that take the sound from the microphones in each of the AirPods and measure the sound level, Apple said. It will then compare that with the sound that is coming out of the speaker driver, and from that work out whether the AirPod is seated properly in the ear and whether the ear tip is the right size.After that is working, the AirPods can also make use of Adaptive EQ, which uses similar features to improve the sound. Apple claims the earphones can automatically tune\u0026nbsplow- and mid-frequencies of the music to the shape of an inidual’s ear — resulting in a rich, immersive listening experience.Created with Sketch.

They cost $249 in the US, considerably more expensive than the AirPods 2, which will remain on sale.The new earphones look largely similar to that cheaper, original version. But they have an ear tip that allows them to sit more snugly in the ear and keep out sound.That noise cancellation is the chief feature of the new earphones, though it can be turned off to allow people to hear sounds from around them. It does so in a way that lets people keep listening to music while also hearing the sounds that are going on around them, Apple said.It is triggered using another update: a new force sensor on the stem allows people to switch it on and off as well as triggering other changes such as playing tracks or hanging up calls.Created with Sketch. Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When the noise cancellation mode is on, the AirPods Pro have a\u0026nbspslightly shorter battery life than the normal AirPods, giving four-and-a-half hours of listening rather than five. Without it on, they last the same amount of time, Apple said.New AirPods: How Apple reinvented its \u0027magical wireless experience\u0027The earphones also include an Ear Tip Fit Test, which plays sound through the earphones and uses that to ensure people are using the right size end on the earphones. Unlike the normal AirPods, users will be able to change the end of the Pro model\u0026nbspto suit the size of their ear.After that, the AirPods use a similar feature called\u0026nbspAdaptive EQ. Apple claims that will adjust the sound to the shape of the wearers\u0027 ear, improving both the audio quality and the noise cancellation.“AirPods are the best-selling headphones in the world. The one-tap setup experience, incredible sound and iconic design have made them a beloved Apple product, and with AirPods Pro, we’re taking the magic even further,” said Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s marketing head, in a statement.“The new in-ear AirPods Pro sound amazing with Adaptive EQ, fit comfortably with flexible ear tips and have innovative Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode. We think customers are going to love this new addition to the AirPods family.”In advance of the release of AirPods Pro, multiple rumours had suggested that the company would release them in a variety of colours, but Apple is still only selling them in white.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This dip was shortly followed by\u0026nbspa major price surge that saw bitcoin briefly reach above $10,000 over the weekend.\u0026nbspDespite the price turmoil over the last week bitcoin has managed to avoid the so-called Death Cross – a market pattern that takes place when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average.Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Nigel Green, who is the chief executive of the\u0026nbspdeVere\u0026nbspGroup financial advisory firm, believes bitcoin will experience more gains\u0026nbspand hit $12,000 before the end of the year – so long as it\u0026nbspis able to stay above the key support level of $8,500 this week.“Bitcoin has registered some impressive gains over the last 48 hours after being in a lull period in recent weeks,” Mr Green told\u0026nbspThe Independent. “The $8,500 support has previously acted as a crucial support for bitcoin. I believe that if bitcoin traders can keep the price above this over the next week, the world’s dominant cryptocurrency will experience a breakout.”Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearOther market analysts claim that geopolitical issues – such as Brexit and the escalating trade war between the US and China – could see investors turn to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to uncertainty in traditional markets.The recent gains could also serve to prompt even more investment, as traders seek to make a quick profit from bitcoin’s sudden good fortune.“After the quick push higher there will be profit taking today but the overall change in sentiment is very positive,” said Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of cryptocurrency firm Luno, who added that there did not appear to be one answer as to why bitcoin experienced such huge gains.Russian nuclear scientist caught mining bitcoin in top-secret labSome attributed bitcoin’s latest price rise to comments reportedly made by Chinese leader President Xi\u0026nbspJinping. Speaking at the Political Bureau of the Central Committee last week, President Xi described bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology as an “important breakthrough” and said more should be done to encourage its development.He added that China should “seize the opportunity” offered by blockchain technology and accelerate its development.His comments add weight to rumours that China is developing its own cryptocurrency, which is expected to be revealed early next year. A recent report published by digital exchange Binance suggests that its launch could have a significant impact on the traditional financial sector by eliminating the need for bank accounts.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.“Do you still believe in the company?” Neumann, who had stepped down as chief executive but was still WeWork\u0027s chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on 6 October, the sources said.The JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management chief executive Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested.With questions swirling around WeWork\u0027s chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.Created with Sketch.Tech giants to be hit by new tax in France Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018A few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork\u0027s largest shareholder, Japan\u0027s SoftBank.Both were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice.This account of how WeWork\u0027s financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.Requests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.SoftBank offered $9.5bn\u0026nbspto WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.In addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company\u0027s “corporate governance problem” - Neumann\u0027s controlling grip.SoftBank\u0027s deal would strip Neumann\u0027s voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China\u0027s Hony Capital, for the company\u0027s precipitous decline, some of the people said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHis erratic management style, combined with WeWork\u0027s lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors.The problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as chief executive\u0026nbspon 24 September because, as WeWork\u0027s founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.WeWork staff outraged at former CEO’s payout while they face job cutsIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.In meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann\u0027s personal borrowings made against WeWork\u0027s stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970m of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.SoftBank\u0027s latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9bn based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.Neumann\u0027s special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million “consulting fee” in return for stepping down from WeWork\u0027s board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.WeWork\u0027s special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann\u0027s bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank\u0027s tender offer, some of the people said.The committee declined to comment for this article.SoftBank\u0027s offer to buy up to $3bn of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.Neumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.SoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn\u0027t prepared to pay more.Most WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said.Goldman Sachs profit hit by losses on investments in WeWork and UberWeWork\u0027s nosee is proof Adam Neumann can\u0027t walk on waterAs WeWork embraces big business, will it lose its cool?JPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing.When the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden.JPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.JPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honour its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.But SoftBank told WeWork\u0027s board that it would not pay the $1.5bn if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added.The problem from SoftBank\u0027s perspective was that those warrants were based on January\u0027s $47bn valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork\u0027s dramatic fall in value.JPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork\u0027s contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.In the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn\u0027t fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee\u0027s deliberations in favor of SoftBank\u0027s offer, they added.SoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept.On Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 30 per cent, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork\u0027s liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.But unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory.WeWork has burned through almost $2.5bn\u0026nbspof cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilise the business.As predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann\u0027s payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the “price” that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann\u0027s voting rights. Otherwise, he said, “Adam could do whatever he wanted.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Since all of those features use that time feature, they will be unable to work after the cut off.The iPhone 5 can be easily updated by heading to the Settings app, clicking the option for general, and pressing software update. If the phone still needs to be updated, a reminder should appear and the new software can be downloaded.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

Kelly then rushed off to ask the Queen if she liked the idea.“I asked him and Edward to give me five minutes so that I could ask the Queen,” Kelly writes in the book, which has been extracted in Hello! Magazine. “I remember the look of shock on Danny’s face that I would be asking Her Majesty straight away, but there’s no point in waiting around with these things: if she said no, that would be the end of it.“I ran upstairs and luckily the Queen was free. She was very amused by the idea and agreed immediately. I asked then if she would like a speaking part. Without hesitation, Her Majesty replied: ‘Of course I must say something. After all, he is coming to rescue me.’Created with Sketch.30 times things went wrong on film and TV sets Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times.

It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour.

The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.“I asked whether she would like to say: ‘Good evening, James,’ or: ‘Good evening, Mr Bond,’ and she chose the latter, knowing the Bond films. Within minutes, I was back in Edward’s office delivering the good news to Danny — I think he almost fell off his chair when I said that the Queen’s only stipulation was that she could deliver that iconic line.”Kelly’s book further reveals details about the Queen’s clothes\u0026nbspand her interactions with notable public figures throughout the 25 years Kelly has worked for the royal household.The book marks the first time a serving member of the royal household has been permitted to write about their experiences while still working for the Queen.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It belongs to the millions who support us all across the country, from the staff in Millbank and in the field to the volunteers and activists, including the million who marched in London nine days ago.“Late last night, Roland Rudd, as outgoing chair of Open Britain (one of the founder organisations of the People’s Vote campaign), sent an email to all staff announcing a boardroom coup. This email invited all staff to a meeting this morning, which Roland Rudd cancelled at the last minute, despite promises made. Instead he decided to go on TV.“The team are not prepared to wait around indefinitely for Roland Rudd to come and provide answers to our questions, so the overwhelming majority of the staff team decided to leave the building together.Long tailbacks as Brexit operation to slow parts of motorway overrunsJohnson’s Brexit deal isn’t just about his agenda, but his backers’A general election cannot solve the mess Brexit has got us into“This is a crucial week for the campaign and the country.

The team are now having a meeting to discuss how the People’s Vote campaign, which we all care passionately about and have dedicated our lives to in recent years, continues to be the largest and most vibrant political movement in the country.”Mr Baldwin, a former spin doctor to Ed Miliband, said the row stemmed from Mr Rudd’s preference for the campaign to fight openly for the UK to Remain in the EU, rather than to seek to persuade people on both sides of the Brexit battle that a public vote is the best way to settle the issue.But Mr Rudd said that it was time for People’s Vote to be reconstituted on a “more structured basis” under a single chief executive.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We new need a much clearer structure as we move forward.”\u0026nbspMr Baldwin told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s a curious situation. We are three days before the Brexit deadline with the prospect of crashing into a general election or out of the EU per both. The Liberal Democrats appear to be playing games… they have abandoned their principled support for a People’s Vote.“Roland Rudd has chosen this time to put a wrecking ball through the campaign… He is making the mistake that a lot of businessmen do when they dabble in politics, which is to think that because they have a certain title on a board, they then own the campaign.“The People’s Vote campaign belongs to the people, not just to one businessman who is hardly ever seen in the campaign.”Mr Rudd told Today that there were opportunities for Mr Baldwin to take a different role in the campaign, saying he wanted to have “a proper civilised chat” with him about it.“This is an absurd argument,” said Mr Rudd – brother of former home secretary Amber Rudd. “Everyone knows perfectly well that we are made up of people who want to Remain.”He complained that elements in the campaign were undermining the push for a referendum by alienating possible support with attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the Liberal Democrats.“We can’t get involved in these kinds of politics,” said Mr Rudd. “We are making a coalition with people from all parties and it’s not for us to write off any one political party or any leadership.”He said there was a “real opportunity” this week of having a second referendum attached to Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.Mr McGrory released a picture of the People’s Vote staff on social media, with a message to say: “It’s easily the greatest privilege of my professional life to be part of such an amazing team at the People’s Vote campaign. All this fantastic group of dedicated and passionate professionals want to do – and all we’ve ever wanted – is to campaign for and get a People’s Vote.”The Independent has worked with People’s Vote on its Final Say referendum campaign, including collaborating on staging three demonstrations in central London that were among the largest ever seen in the UK.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.“Do you still believe in the company?” Neumann, who had stepped down as chief executive but was still WeWork\u0027s chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on 6 October, the sources said.The JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management chief executive Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested.With questions swirling around WeWork\u0027s chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.Created with Sketch.Tech giants to be hit by new tax in France Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018A few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork\u0027s largest shareholder, Japan\u0027s SoftBank.Both were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice.This account of how WeWork\u0027s financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.Requests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.SoftBank offered $9.5bn\u0026nbspto WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.In addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company\u0027s “corporate governance problem” - Neumann\u0027s controlling grip.SoftBank\u0027s deal would strip Neumann\u0027s voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China\u0027s Hony Capital, for the company\u0027s precipitous decline, some of the people said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHis erratic management style, combined with WeWork\u0027s lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors.The problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as chief executive\u0026nbspon 24 September because, as WeWork\u0027s founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.WeWork staff outraged at former CEO’s payout while they face job cutsIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.In meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann\u0027s personal borrowings made against WeWork\u0027s stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970m of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.SoftBank\u0027s latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9bn based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.Neumann\u0027s special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million “consulting fee” in return for stepping down from WeWork\u0027s board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.WeWork\u0027s special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann\u0027s bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank\u0027s tender offer, some of the people said.The committee declined to comment for this article.SoftBank\u0027s offer to buy up to $3bn of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.Neumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.SoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn\u0027t prepared to pay more.Most WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said.Goldman Sachs profit hit by losses on investments in WeWork and UberWeWork\u0027s nosee is proof Adam Neumann can\u0027t walk on waterAs WeWork embraces big business, will it lose its cool?JPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing.When the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden.JPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.JPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honour its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.But SoftBank told WeWork\u0027s board that it would not pay the $1.5bn if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added.The problem from SoftBank\u0027s perspective was that those warrants were based on January\u0027s $47bn valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork\u0027s dramatic fall in value.JPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork\u0027s contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.In the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn\u0027t fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee\u0027s deliberations in favor of SoftBank\u0027s offer, they added.SoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept.On Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 30 per cent, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork\u0027s liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.But unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory.WeWork has burned through almost $2.5bn\u0026nbspof cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilise the business.As predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann\u0027s payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the “price” that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann\u0027s voting rights. Otherwise, he said, “Adam could do whatever he wanted.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

No incumbent could survive in these conditions.”Mr Gedan added that Mr Fernandez is “an untested leader” who is inheriting a ruinous economy and unfavourable international conditions.\u0026nbsp“The government of Alberto Fernandez and Cristina Kirchner will feature Peronists of varied political tendencies, but the crucial question is what the dynamic will be between the pragmatic president and more ideological and polarising vice president,” Michael Shifter, the head of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank, said.Brazil sends in troops amid anger at failure to tackle vast oil spillBolsonaro poll rating plummets in Brazil over Amazon fires falloutChile’s president to sack entire cabinet in bid to end protestsArgentina and Uruguay suffer ‘massive’ power outages to millionsArgentina could close 10 government ministries to help stabilise peso“The nature of that power struggle will determine the direction of Argentina\u0027s economic, social and foreign policy in coming years.”However, Mr Shifter did not believe a return to the populist policies of Ms Kirchner’s presidency was likely.“Today, Argentina simply does not have the economic conditions for unchecked spending,” he said.“This will not be a replay of her presidency.”Additional reporting by APShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They want No Deal “taken off the table”. No one is fooled. Labour fear Boris, and Corbyn is toxic.Boris cannot govern this Remainer-dominated Parliament with no majority against an opposition so extreme and so utterly without principle.Labour blocks his Brexit deal. It blocks No Deal. It tries to block all Government legislation. It cannot block an election too.It will be a monstrous abdication of responsibility motivated by naked cowardice. Not that the Lib Dems or SNP are any better.These Remainer clowns have brought our democracy to its knees. Most of Britain is ashamed of them.OFCOM’S report into the BBC makes grim reading for a corporation in rapid decline.It is fast losing young viewers to Netflix, YouTube and Amazon. Butit is worried by that, it should be petried by the likely impact of its decision to strip over-s of their free licence.This giant empire, funded by a compulsory “tax”, needs massive reform.It must throttle back on its crazy expansionism, sht away from areas covered ­better by commercial organisations and bite the bullet over its £billion-a-year public funding model.The licence fee is almost a century old. It is as out of date as the Beeb itself now looks in this new era of multiple choice funded by voluntary subscription.The BBC remains an important part of British le. But the TV tax, with prosecution for non-payment, has to go.THE explosion in kne-carrying offences is a testament to the success of the police’s revived stop-and-search tactics.Yes, it is depressing these crimes are at a nine-year high. But that was inevitable when searches were also increased by a third over a year.Their scaling-back by Theresa May as Home Secretary in  was a disaster.The Tories’ “two strikes and you’re out” policy, automatic jail for a second offence, is disgracefully ignored by courts.

But Johnson admitted the EU was inclined to offer an extension to the end of January and that Emmanuel Macron was fighting a lonely battle against it.Earlier in the day, the Elysée told No the French President was too isolated on the issue to veto a longer extension.In a sign of how much he is relying on Macron, Johnson then pleadingly recited the opening line of the carol “Oh come, oh come Emmanuel” to ministers.One of No’s hopes is that EU leaders will see the Opposition refusing both a general election and to pass the withdrawal agreement as is and come round to Macron’s way of thinking: That there is little point in offering this country a three-month extension as ­Parliament will just waste the time.One No source predicts that the sight of the opposition blocking an election will “push the EU towards either the Macron position or a very long extension”.In a sign that Johnson’s gambit is having some success, the EU is waiting until Parliament has voted on an election before deciding whatof extension to offer.If this doesn’t work, the Government hopes it can shame Labour into having an election.The Chief Whip told those present that they would “make Labour look like right d***s”they didn’t vote for an election.But not everyone is convinced this will work.One of those present tells me thatthey were a Labour MP, they would “rather look like a d*** than lose their seat”.I understand, though, No intends to bring multiple votes to try to force an election. One Cabinet minister who has discussed this strategy with Johnson tells me: “Every time , it advertises that they are not prepared to support Brexit or have an election.“It reinforces the sense that he is the only person trying to get things done.”Johnson himself has told allies thatLabour rejects his offer to pass the withdrawal agreement and have an election, then it will be an “effective demonstration” that this Parliament won’t — and can’t — break the current deadlock.Proving this Parliament can’t break the deadlock is one thing. Actually breaking it is quite another.One of those present on Thursday tells me Johnson seemed genuinely angry at Labour’s refusal to give him an election and “betrayed a sense he’s cornered”.Something must happen before January , though.If it doesn’t, the threat of No Deal will be back on the table.Andthe UK has wasted this extension, European patience may snap and they might not offer another one.One senior Cabinet minister tells me “there will be an attempt to use an SOto put the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before the House”. This would involve the rebel group around Oliver Letwin trying to bring the deal back to Parliament so that the Commons could vote on it. But it is far from clear whether this approach could work.Another possibility is the Opposition bringing down the Government. If they did this, they would have to agree on an alternative prime minister or end up in a general election.British politics looks more deadlocked than ever today. Johnson’s hope is that pressure from voters will eventually break this deadlock and sweep away the obstacles to him passing his Brexit deal.But he will almost certainly have to put up with a delay both to Brexit and the election before he can get his way.NO one at political Cabinet spoke against the idea of a December election. But privately, several ministers have grave doubts about the wisdom of this strategy.One frets: “Who jumps out of bed on a cold December morning to vote for the Government ”There is a view that the Government could have used getting the Commons to approve its deal in broad terms as a spur for pressing on with the ­legislation, bringing a new timetable to the Commons after MPs rejected its initial offer of three days’ debate. One complains that the election idea is “a massive distraction”.“Why aren’t we using the momentum of getting a second reading ” they ask.On the backbenches there are also concerns. One senior backbencher tells me: “We’ll vote for an election with great reluctance.”He worries that “being seen to try not very hard to get the bill through” undercuts the new Tory message that they are the deal party.The other great worry is that while the public mood is with Boris Johnson now, that could change. One minister warns it is a huge risk to have a “winter election at a very febrile time”, adding: “We’ve no idea what public opinion will be on polling day.”IF Boris Johnson gets his way and there’s a general election this year, what happens to those Tories who lost the whip for voting for the Benn Act At Thursday’s gathering, Nicky Morgan argued that the party needed “clarity” on what would happen to those who had lost the whip but had voted with the Government against the Letwin amendment and for the Brexit deal and the accelerated timetable for passing it.Boris Johnson has previously been adamant that he would not allow any of the  to stand as Tory candidates at the next election. But I am told he made sympathetic noises in response to Morgan’s point.Inside Boris Johnson’s circle, there’s the beginnings of a sht in attitude. There is a feeling that those who have consistently voted with the Government in recent weeks are worth bringing back in.With a deal secured, the issue that led to their rebellion has been addressed.At the same time, several of these MPs would be better placed to hold their seat for the Tories than any other candidate.AT political Cabinet on Thursday, Boris Johnson pointed at the Northern Powerhouse Minister Jake Berry and said “Kwasi”, a reference to Kwasi Kwarteng the Energy Minister.Cabinet ministers were baffled at how the PM confused the two.They don’t look at all alike.After Berry deadpanned, “An easy mistake to make”, the room fell about laughing.A Budget would offer the Tories a chance to outline some of their more popular economic policies and highlight plans to boost infrastructure.If the Opposition voted it down, it would make the case for the election Boris Johnson so desperately wants.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes. For further details of our complaints policy and to make a complaint please click here."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit limbo halloween scariest prospect","story":"Just when it looked like finally there was some progress on Tuesday — when the Commons voted for Boris’s new deal — Parliament, with Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party’s encouragement, votedfor delay and, even worse, handed over control of what happens next to the other EU member states.Corbyn has also been stalling on agreeing to a general election — saying Boris must assure Westminster there would be no chance of No Deal.He doesn’t want Brexit, he doesn’t want a general election.He has caused untold damage to the country, destroyed any chance of an orderly exit from the EU and now won’t even let the British people have a say in an election.What does he want  Early this year he was demanding a general election and now he has the chance to fight one he has refused it.To make matters worse, the member states are also stalling — saying they can’t make a decision on theof the next Brexit delay.For me, the problem with Brexit is that it wasn’t properly defined. When the nation voted on whether or not to leave the EU, it was boiled down to the simplest possible question and answer: Yes or No.So the die was cast and we voted to split with the EU. But that’s the thing about orce.Between the time you say you want one, and the time you actually get your decree nisi there is a whole lot of pain as the time is filled with blame, retribution and name-calling.Because of the lack of clarity from the vote on what it meant to leave, no one thought about the most important aspects, the red lines, of how Britain should leave the EU.It didn’t need a clairvoyant to predict that lots of those dferent Brexit visions would be fundamentally incompatible.We can’t stay in the customs union and have complete control of immigration.We can’t have no hard border on the island of Ireland the Good Friday Agreement and also leave the single market. I could go on.The point is that the nation answered Yes or No to something that — it turns out — our politicians have decided to interpret in multiple ways.And that has been the fundamental problem.Because MPs have been unable to compromise in order to find a deal that pleases them enough for it to be passed. And the public despair.Politics only s effectively when a party has a clear majority to get their legislation through government. And this one doesn’t.It’s no surprise that neither party has a clear majority while they are being led by the more extreme and dogmatic elements.I was in the House of Lords and the House of Commons on Wednesday and the contrast in atmosphere between the two is stark.Politicians in the Commons don’t listen or pay each other any respect.And the amount of average front bench MPs on both sides is shameful. No wonder we have stalemate.There is an unbridgeable gulf between Leavers and Remainers, and an inability among politicians to compromise.We’ve either got to leave with No Deal or we have to revoke Article  altogether.There is nothing in between, no room for compromise or pragmatism. As a result, we are paralysed. So the answer has to be to have a general election.Usually it’s politicians who tell us what to do for the good of the country, but now we need to tell the politicians what to do.Because only with a majority government can we put an end to the Brexit misery.Although who relishes the prospect of voting on a dark December night  Least of all Jeremy Corbyn, the only Opposition leader in history who has refused the offer of an election more than once.It’s no wonder when you look at the polls. He’s unelectable, but still using his position to block Brexit and stop us from getting on with it.Until there is an election we remain in this terrible limbo. I voted Remain but, like most people, now I just want it over with.Politicians must stop using Brexit for their own political aims.If they don’t soon come up with a solution, the risk is that people are increasingly likely to vote for extreme options in a bid to make it stop.And that is a scary prospect.WHEN it comes to le choices I am a big believer in the live and let live school of thought.Andpeople choose to have cosmetic surgery because it makes them feel better, that’s their choice.But in the latest photos of Lauren Goodger her flawless complexion and insanely pillowy pout are so extreme I didn’t realise it was her.Which, to me, raises the question of why anyone would want to render themselves completely unrecogniseable IT is ironic that one of the most important causes of our time – climate change – is being eclipsed by the behaviour of the very people professing to be addressing the issue.Following last week’s debacle with the protestor on the Tube at Canning Town, this week a jobless Extinction Rebellion protester who spray-painted a war memorial has been ordered by a judge to pay £ as punishment for “senseless vandalism”.The volunteer tree-planter, Joseph O’Malley, wrote the word “mother” on the ft tall bronze sculpture in Whitehall last November, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard.And protestors who act like this wonder why we have no sympathy for them.Meanwhile, this year’s ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests have so far cost the taxpayer £million, it emerged this week.Sure, their argument would be that the cost to the taxpayer will ultimately be a lot more than thatwe do nothing about climate change.But these tactics and statistics make me seethe with anger.I, like most of us, have to go to work so people like O’Malley can choose instead to spend their time damaging a memorial dedicated to heroes who sacriced their lives so that, ironically, yobs like him can enjoy freedom.In my view a fine is not enough. His benefits should be stopped and he should be jailed for such a disgraceful and disrespectful act.Make no mistake, stopping climate change is essential for all of our futures.But these tactics are not only distracting and damaging to that cause they are actively counter productive.But put together with another story this week showing that the number of children aged between eight and  with anorexia has doubled , it is a good reminder that we should all keep an eye on our children’s phone use.ANYONE  catch Nigella Lawson’s ultimately down to earth confession that she followed up an evening of fine dining at Noble Rot, a snazzy award-winning restaurant in London, by eating a bag of pickled onion Monster Munch in bed.You’ve got to love the fact that after eating oysters, black pudding and venison Nigella has a Monster Munch nightcap.I am fully supportive. It’s just that, well, in bed  I can think only of the crumbs.SO sorry to hear about Amanda Holden’s bad luck breaking her leg on holiday at half-term.Buther cloud has a silver lining it is surely the fact that there are not that many people who could manage to look quite so glamorous with a leg that’s broken in two places.THIS week it was announced that jail sentences for terrorists will be increased.The Sentencing Council will propose changes to its guidelines after Parliament passed a new anti-terror law earlier this year which allowed for longer terms of imprisonment.Under the moves, the “starting point” for judges when jailing someone for “encouragement of terrorism” will double to ten years in the worst cases.But isn’t there something wrong with the fact that laws to delay Brexit get passed in hours, yet laws like this take months GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

By denying us a vote on his deal HE is now the one blocking Brexit.The  Labour manesto on which I was re-elected was clear: “Labour accepts the referendum result”.It promised we would “seek to unite the country around a Brexit deal that works for every community in Britain”.I repeated these words countless times in my constituency, a former mining area of Nottinghamshire that suffered under Conservative governments.I told them Labour would respect the  per cent of them who voted to leave, but that we would never stop fighting for a Brexit that brought them closer to prosperity not further away from it.This could be our last chance to keep that promise. That is why I voted with the Government on Tuesday.I did so not because I like Boris Johnson’s deal, but because I don’t like it and I want the chance to change it.This version of Brexit is flawed. It weakens workplace rights, consumer rights and environmental protections.It doesn’t include a customs union, which would be good for workers and businesses.This is not about supporting the Tories and their miserable agenda. It is about my role as an MP in opposition.I agree with John McDonnell, who said earlier this week: “By amending the Withdrawal Agreement Bill . . . MPs have an opportunity to reject the  choice between Boris Johnson’s bad deal and No Deal, and instead support an agreement that works for everyone.”I have signed Tory MP Ken Clarke’s amendment to stay in the customs union, safeguarding our economy and the many businesses that would sufferwe leave it. I want to make sure that working people are protected.I want to ensure that Brexit doesn’t give the Tories a chance to attack workers’ rights, as they have been doing for a decade.If we can’t get those changes, I won’t vote for the Bill at the final stage. In , I launched Labour’s Remain campaign alongside Jeremy Corbyn.I travelled the country making the case for the EU as the best way to guarantee workers rights, economic stability and environmental protections, among other things.But we lost that campaign. AndI stand for anything, I stand for respecting the voices and interests of working class people, who overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU.Some  per cent of those who voted to leave say that politicians don’t listen to people like them. It is these people I came into politics to give a voice to.I can’t ignore them on the major issue of our time. I know Labour colleagues who voted against the Government this week are also deeply committed to those voters.These decisions are not easy for any of us. There is an appetite for compromise in the country which is not reflected in Parliament.Earlier this year, I invited both passionate Leavers and Remainers in my constituency to meet. The debate was lively, but there was none of the shouting and jeering we see in Parliament.The majority of Remainers said they were willing to respect the result and Leavers still wanted to leave — but with a deal, not without one.If voters can compromise, why can’t politicians  I didn’t come into Parliament to protest, but to deal with the world as it is, and make it a bit better.However I can, I want to tell my constituents that I did everything I could to get the Brexit nearly  per cent of them voted for, while protecting jobs and rights in the process.Shortly after the referendum I was at a bus stop in my constituency. I was chatting to a woman and the conversation turned to Brexit. Having voting to leave the EU, she asked: “Do you think it will actually happen ”I didn’t hesitate to say, “Of course! We are a democracy and that’s how people voted.” I never thought that three-and-a-half years later we would still be arguing.If Boris Johnson really wants to deliver Brexit he has to do the one thing he’s so far failed to do — and that’s compromise. This General Election will be about so much more than Brexit.It is a chance for us to create a country where power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many and not the privileged few and I will be giving my all to bring that about.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has already put himself out for hire for £, in recent days.Bercow whines he is “entitled to make a living”, and after ten shouty years on the globally screened Parliament Channel he has achieved lucrative star status.As cartoon TV hero Homer Simpson has proved, audiences love grotesques.Once free from high office, Bercow can quickly fill his boots with fees worth tens of thousands a time.But could there be another motive for his decision to go now rather than after he has completely screwed Brexit Had he stayed on, it seems he risked being “tried” on incendiary allegations of bullying and bringing Parliament into disrepute — an offence which might have cost him an automatic peerage and a seat in the House of Lords.Once out, he is “beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament”.Bercow has been haunted for years by allegations of volcanic temper tantrums and humiliation of staff, including some of the Commons’ most senior officials. He denies all the claims.Official probes have been shamelessly stymied by Labour because of Bercow’s “Bollocks to Brexit” stance.Labour grandee Dame Margaret Beckett blurted out her party’s motives, insisting Bercow must stay because Brexit “trumps bad behaviour”.The hypocrisy stinks. Labour claims to be the workers’ party. Here it is standing up for the bosses’ class.Parliament has also been criticised for failing victims of bullying. But kicking these charges into touch seems to have worked.Bercow’s decision to go now has persuaded former Black Rod David Leakey and the Speaker’s ex-Private Secretary, Angus Sinclair, to abandon claims of humiliation and abuse.In  Mr Sinclair, hardened by  years before the mast, told BBC Newsnight that Bercow mimicked him and was “prone to over-the-top anger”.Mr Leakey, an ex-Army Lieutenant-General, spoke of “the red mist descending” as Bercow “banged the table, yelled and was highly insulting to me personally”.He warns the Sundaythat a Bercow peerage would bring the House of Lords into disrepute at a time when politicians’ reputations are already at an all-time low.“Whatever Bercow’s merits as Speaker, I believe he should be treated in the same way as any other successful but disreputable citizen of the country,” says Leakey.“He is disreputable because, as a high-profile public figure, he has set an appalling example to the country, not least in publicly demeaning MPs in the chamber and on television.“As a senior figure in any other organisation, his behaviour would likely have resulted in investigation, censure or even dismissal.“He should not be rewarded with ‘baubles’ or a peerage.”Having watched this snarling, purple-faced Mr Punch discredit the constitution, stain the reputation of Parliament and demean the most distinguished post in British politics, it is impossible to disagree.There is now a chance for MPs to clean out this soiled stable and restore Parliament’s reputation.Decent Labour MP and popular Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is front-runner for the job. But none of the candidates could be worse, even preachy Labour veteran Harriet Harman.To quote the former Black Rod, it should not be rewarded by any party with an unelected place on the overstuffed red benches of the House of Lords.BREXIT-cancelling Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson thinks we are all stupid.Her plot with the SNP to stage a snap election on Monday, December , has flashing red lights all over it.It would be a vehicle for oddball amendments including votes at  – just the impressionable age when fantasy politics appeals most.She pretends she is trying to stop Boris “crashing out” with No Deal.Yet Boris wants a deal.

Although the UK has no consular presence in Syria from which to provide assistance, we will do all we can for unaccompanied minors and orphans.

But just as that motion dies, a separate bid is gaining momentum from the SNP and Lib Dems which pushes for a December  election instead.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson wrote to the Tory Prime Minister today asking for clarity after No sources suggested Downing Street could swing behind a similar plan.Crucially, because itaposs a Bill this second bid would only need half of all voting MPs to back it - not the -MP apossuper majorityapos that Boris Johnson needs tonight.A vote could be held on the fresh election bid as soon as tomorrow, and pass evenit doesnapost have Labour backing. No said it would consider backing “something like” this optionit loses tonight’s vote. Furious Labour blasted the Lib Dem and SNP bid as a ridiculous stunt as Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell raged: Looks like the Lib Dem and Tory pact of  is being re-established.  They are back together, selling out the People’s Vote campaign and the cross party campaign to prevent a no deal. The Lib Dems will stop at nothing to get their ministerial cars back. But despite Labouraposs fury and initial Tory brush-offs the fresh election bid appeared to be gathering momentum. Yesterday, Tory chairman James Cleverly branded the Lib Dem plan a “gimmick” while Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan also called it a “stunt”. Yet last night government aide Bim Afolami said: Iaposm not necessarily averse to it. And today schools minister Nick Gibb did not rule out backing a move similar to the Lib Demsapos, despite accusing the party of disobeying the  vote to leave the EU.It came as EU leaders agreed to delay the Brexit deadline for the third time, setting a new flexible date of January  - which will come earlierthereaposs a deal agreed. A source told Reuters the SNP Lib Dem election bid was a factor that persuaded EU leaders to get a three-month extension over the line. Labour has insisted it wonapost back an election until Mr Johnson makes absolutely clear a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table. That had been widely thought to mean a no-deal on October .But Jeremy Corbyn has since suggested it also includes a threat of a no-deal in  - one which is wrapped up in Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal.Boris Johnson sailed so close to the deadline this time that a no-deal plan known as Operation Brock, slowing lorries to mph on Kentaposs M, had already come into force at am today. There was a slim chance Labour - which has told MPs to abstain or vote against an election tonight - could still change its tune before tonightaposs vote. Jeremy Corbyn was due to summon a meeting of his shadow cabinet later today. Boris Johnson wanted MPs to back a general election through the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act - which crucially would not fix the date of the poll in law, or have any conditions.The Lib Dem bid on the other hand would set the date of December  in law. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said this would remove his wriggle room to sneakily schedule a poll after the January  deadline. Because people canapost trust what this man says, I think setting that date in law is a very good idea, she said. But her bid for a one-line Bill could also failit becomes snarled up in amendments, such as for EU citizens to voteor to extend the franchise to -year-olds. Despite backing votes at , Ms Swinson suggested she wouldnapost want amendments saying the Bill should be as simple as possible.  She told the Today programme: It certainly, it seems to me a sensible way forward. We also understand from our contacts in the EU that putting forward this bill and sending the letter that we did has helped out EU friends have confidence thatthey offer the extension that theyaposre discussing today that that will be time well spent. One of their big concerns was that they offered an extension earlier this year, said aposdonapost waste the timeapos, and then we had a Conservative leadership election and Boris Johnson mucked about not trying to get a deal, shutting down parliament, and you know, the very master class in time wasting so, understandably, they had a degree of reluctance, I think evidenced by the fact they didnapost grant the extension on Friday when many thought they would. So Iaposm hopeful that as a result of what weaposve done we will see that extension granted today because otherwise weaposre still in the very real risk of crashing out without a deal on Thursday. She said there are ious reasons why December  makes more sense than December  for an election.  Clearly, itaposs three further days away from Christmas and I understand that the public appetite for an election around Christmas is not necessarily high so I think from the point of view of the economy and retailers, keeping it as far away as possible is helpful. We also have the consideration that there will be many people that will be moving around the country around that time. Many students who live in two places but might only be registered to vote in one place. We wouldnapost want to see people disenfranchised and so having it earlier rather than closer to the end of term time for them I think makes sense as well. And also, it is the earliest possible date where we can pass this Bill, and then have an election, so it gets it done as soon as possible, Ms Swinson added. How does a one-line election Bill work By MIKEY SMITHIf the PM can’t get the two-thirds majority he needs to trigger an election under the cumbersome Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, there is one other option. He – or anyone  – can table a one-line bill that would legally change the FTPA just like any other law. It’s a neat way around the FTPA, but it’s risky. Because it’s a fully-fledged bill, not just a motion, MPs can change it once it is under way. They could tack on anything they like – including a second referendum. But like a game of legal Buckaroo, every extra thing they hang on it makes it more likely to be pulled.

And the overwhelming majority of the British public do not want the NHS included in any trade deals with any other country, according to the poll commissioned by campaign group We Own It, carried out by Survation.    It found % said they didn’t think the NHS should be included in trade deals, compared to just % who said that they did. When asked which parties they trust to ensure the NHS is a publicly funded and publicly run institution, just % said they trusted the Conservative Party compared to % for Labour - the highest of any party. Mr Johnson has denied the NHS is up for grabs in a deal on numerous occasions and ahead of meeting Mr Trump in New York last month, the PM said he would tell the President: “When we do a free trade deal, we must make sure that the NHS is not on the table, that we do not in any way prejudice or jeopardise our standards on animal welfare and food hygiene in the course of that deal, and that we open up American markets.”    The polling comes as a coalition of more than a dozen organisations - led by Keep Our NHS Public and We Own It - have come together to push the government to protect the NHS from trade deals. Ellen Lees, campaigns officer of We Own It, said: “This poll shows clearly that the public understand just how big of a threat a US trade deal is to our NHS. And it shows that they’re firmly against the idea that our NHS could be sold off bit by bit to Donald Trump and American private healthcare giants. “Because the private sector already has a major role in the NHS, it is automatically on the table in a trade deal - no matter what Boris Johnson says. “That’s why it’s absolutely vital that the government ends the privatisation of our NHS once and for all. That’s the only way we can protect it from being sold off in a trade deal.” DR Tony O’Sullivan, co-chair of Keep Our NHS Public, said: “The NHS has faced six years of destructive top-down disorganisation.

Sources said the Prime Minister is looking at making a fourth attempt to dissolve Parliament and trigger a Christmas election - hours after his third is set to fall flat. Unlike tonightaposs third vote, which needs a apossuper-majorityapos of  MPs, a fourth vote would be a one-line Bill which only needs half of MPs to back it. This plan is almost identical to one mooted by the Lib Dems and SNP yesterday, which tried to bring forward an election to December . It could see Parliament dissolved and an election countdown begun by the end of this week. But any Bill could be amended to include radical changes like votes for EU citizens, -year-olds or both.A Number  source said: Tonight is Labour ’s last chance to have election with Brexit delivered - they can vote for th and get Brexit done before. If not, we will introduce a Bill almost identical to the Lib Dem  SNP tomorrow”.A Lib Dem source today said the party canapost see any problem with backing a No version of their own Bill - and in fact it could be some help in getting it through the House of Lords.     But support would come with conditions. A Lib Dem source said the party would demand a triple lock of guarantees to any No Bill:Protection from a no-deal Brexit Ruling out using an election to rush through the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Bill , which encodes Boris Johnsonaposs deal into law Setting the date of an election explicitly in the Bill - to quell fears Boris Johnson could slyly move it after MPs have already voted. But a Lib Dem source did not rule out tabling or backing other amendments to a No election Bill. And a source said the party could back a date that wasnapost December . Lib Dems could abstainanother party brings forward, for instance, amendments to allow votes for -year-olds, or extend the franchise to EU citizens - both causes the Libs are sympathetic to. However, a source said that was not the partyaposs preference. We want to keep this Bill as tight as possible, they said.Letaposs be frank about the politics of this. If there are those kinds of amendments to this Bill, it doesnapost go through.  Furious Labour blasted the Lib Dem and SNP election Bill as a ridiculous stunt and accused the parties of abandoning a bid to have a second referendum on Brexit. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell raged: Looks like the Lib Dem and Tory pact of  is being re-established. They are back together, selling out the People’s Vote campaign and the cross party campaign to prevent a no deal. The Lib Dems will stop at nothing to get their ministerial cars back. A Lib Dem source hit back at Mr McDonnell, saying there simply are not the numbers for a Peopleaposs Vote in the current Parliament. They claimed there is a risk Jeremy Corbyn could connive with Boris Johnson to deliver Brexit because EU leaders - who today agreed an extension to January  - are unlikely to delay Brexit again.  We’ve run out of time. All the EU figures are clear that we’re not going to get another extension”, the source said. It is highly unlikely that President Macron will be in a minority at the end of Januarywe still havenapost resolved the impasse. He is likely to be in a majority. The clock is ticking and we need to make decisions. Highlighting the lack of meaningful debates in Parliament, they added: That is not a ing legislature. How can we defend carrying on taking a salary while this place isnapost basically doing its job  They added: We need to break the gridlock. The source didnapost rule out the Lib Dems backing an election on a date other than December  but said they want it as soon as possible. The earlier it comes the better. The more youaposre getting into Christmas the more irritated people whoaposve got Christmas shopping and other things theyaposd rather be getting on with will become. Labour has insisted it wonapost back an election until Mr Johnson makes absolutely clear a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table.

The -year-old fell into an inner-city Birmingham gang as a teenager and knows how lucky he is to still be alive today. There was the time he was surrounded by  rival gang members armed with knives at a bus stop. It was only running full pelt that saved him then. The time another rival smashed a mirror over his head. The time guys from his own gang turned on him with a metal bar during a dispute. And the time during a fight he was passed a kne to protect himself, only to then be battered into the side of a car, crushing his hand and pushing the weapon clean through it.  These are the stories he now tells young teens who find themselves, like he was, drawn to gang culture, often due to a sense of not belonging, little hope for their futures, or because their own families have broken down. And it is Hezron’s achievement in turning his own le around, and his dedication to helping others do the same, which has seen him crowned Prince’s Trust Young Achiever at the Mirror’s Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB. “I show the young people the scars on my face, my hands, and I tell them what happened with each one,” he explains. “I see how it opens up their eyes. They have been in those situations, they know it could have gone wrong. I say aposAny of those times I could have lost my le.apos I make them concentrate on their lives. I tell them the gang does not love them and there is another le.”    He adds: “I never thought someone like myself would be put forward for something like this. At one point, I didn’t even knowI would be alive today. “It has made me realise anything is possible, but you have to believe in yourself, and you can achieve. That’s what I try and do for the young people. I want to be the person I didn’t have when I was younger, who they can ask for advice. I needed that person, but I felt alone.” Today, Hezron runs his own business, More Talk More Action, which aims to reach more young people in this position. He is also a Prince’s Trust Young Ambassador after being signposted as a young man to a theatre scheme run by The Prince’s Trust, which enabled him to first find employment. It is a le far from his experiences as a child and teenager. Aged five, a terrible accident saw Hezron fall into a bath of boiling water at home and suffer debilitating burns across his body. But it was the bullying he suffered when he came out of hospitaland started school which was to have the most damaging effect.    Hezron’s method for coping with the bullies became to fight back, and soon he developed anger issues which spiralled and affected both his school and home le. He was excluded from both primary and secondary schools, and admits his own mum became frightened by his outbursts and their relationship eventually broke down. “It was a cycle, I became so angry I wouldn’t know what I was doing. I was violent towards my mum, my whole family. She was scared of me,” he admits. From a young age he sofa-surfed with friends and family, and even found himself sleeping rough as young as . By  he was housed in emergency accommodation, then a BB and finally given a council flat, but he felt completely alone, frightened, and struggled to cope with the pressures of adult le. By , kicked out of college after a row with a tutor, he was drawn into the gang. “It offered me a family, to me it was a bunch of brothers who would support each other, it made me feel safer” he explains.    “A lot of them were in similar positions to myself. It was just good to be part of something – I wasn’t doing anything .” Hezron began selling drugs, and although he didn’t carry a kne for fear of being stopped and searched by the police, he opted instead for a sharp pair of scissors as a “deterrent” he explains. “A lot of young people I speak today carry a kne,” he says. “But they do it out of fear. They don’t want to be a victim, they tell me they wouldn’t leave their house without a kne.” Hezron remained with the gang for around two years. In the end, it took just one supportive comment from one empathetic person to help him decide to leave. It was what he had been waiting for. Finding himself convicted for robbery aged , he went to his pre-sentencing report appointment, and the woman writing it greeted him sadly.    He recalls: “She said ‘Not another black man’. She asked me what had happened and she told me ‘You don’t deserve to go to prison. She seem like a nice guy, hanging around with the wrong crowd.” She told me things would only get worseI went to prison. “She wrote my report, and I didn’t go to prison. It made me realise that everything I was doing was pointless.” Hezron says he immediately stopped hanging out with the guys in the gang. Determined to change completely he went shopping and ditched his black hoodie and balaclava for a white top and new jeans.

You can’t cause [birds] harm or stress andI just stop feeding them I’ll be doing that. When you stand outside when they’re being fed, it’s near enough the same birds every time because I recognise the markings, Mr Buist, of Patchway, Gloucestershire, said today.  Mr Buist, who retired after suffering from a series of strokes, was inspired to feed birds regularly after visiting a duck pond with his granddaughter. The former Network Rail employee estimates between - pigeons and - smaller birds, including robins, blue tits and jays, visit his garden at once. He alleges the first complaint in relation to the habit came late last year. The grandfather added: Before we had a chance to say anything he said, aposYou’re in breach of your tenancy agreement andyou’re in breach of your tenancy agreement you risk eviction.apos If they’d said don’t feed them three times a day I would have said, aposOK, we’ll only feed them twice a dayapos,” Mr Buist said. Or maybe we could have fed them fewer times a week and cut it down gradually. But the landlord just wasn’t interested and said, aposIt’s in your tenant agreementapos. Bromford Housing Association said birds can cause a nuisance but Mr Buist rejects this notion. You see things on the internet now about birds, saying there’s nothing for them to feed on and around here there’s not a lot of common land for birds anywhere.

Tracy Dockerill says her sat nav is getting revenge for her shouting at it - by repeatedly branding her a aposmotherf****rapos when it gives directions. Six months ago she said her TomTom switched from a calm woman to a potty-mouthed bloke who announced aposyou have reached your destination motherf****rapos. Ever since then  itaposs been spewing obscenities at a red-faced Tracy - including the line aposturn right a**holeapos.    The care worker has been left convinced the machine is getting revenge on her for shouting at it when she drives in the wrong direction. Tracy, , only revealed her aposdirty secretapos to daughter Jade Dockerill earlier this month when the pair were in the car together and the uncouth voice made itself known again. TomTom said Tracy has an older device where itaposs possible to record your own voice guidance, possibly done by a previous owner or cheeky pal, and that they can assure her itaposs not the sat nav shouting obscenities at her. However the family claim that no one was aware this was even possible and her sister who gave her the sat nav was described as a aposvery sensibleapos mum-of-two who would not do it. Tracy, from Denham in Buckinghamshire, said: It was a bit like it was my dirty secret and I felt a bit ashamed.    I did wonderI was hearing things at first. Iaposve been using it for months with a ladyaposs voice and then all of a sudden one day it said aposturn right aeholeapos in a chapaposs voice - well I nearly crashed the car. I remember thinking aposoh my god this is dreadfulapos and told it aposI canapost believe youaposre talking to me like thatapos then all of a sudden it swore at me again but even worse. It then said aposyou have reached your destination motherf*erapos. Itaposs like itaposs possessed. You can imagine how shocked I was. When I was a child I had my mouth washed out with soap by my mumI swore so I donapost swear. I didnapost laugh, I was put out by it.  Tracy, who has a reputation for being terrible at directions, was given the device by her exasperated sister Donna Brooke  months ago. Donna offered her the GPS after discovering Tracy had ended up driving round Heathrow terminal three on her way home from visiting her in Brentwood - a trip sheaposd made countless times before. Technophobe Tracy spent months hopping out of her blue Nissan Note to stop people on the street and ask them to input her destination into the GPS. One day a kind-hearted passerby gave her a crash course in how to use it and activated the voice instructions so Tracy wouldnapost have to rely on reading the map while behind the wheel. Tracy claims that one day out of the blue six months ago, instead of the soothing strains of the female sat nav voice a aposdeep growlyapos male voice popped up and started spouting filth.  Tracy said: Itaposs hit and miss, he doesnapost come on all the time. If I delay in taking the turning because of traffic or I go past a turning thataposs when he generally starts. As Iaposm driving along I start to think the horrible man has gone away and itaposs just the nice lady and then all of a sudden when you least expect it the chap butts in and he starts again. My sister Donna gave it to me because I get lost quite easily.  When I first got it I couldnapost figure out how to use it so I used to stop and ask strangers to show me, but then someone showed me how to set up the aposhomeapos button.  When I started using it it used to get me lost even more so I used to have rows with it. I would shout aposyouaposre a stupid sat nav, you donapost have a clue where weaposre going, Iaposm not listening to you anymore. All of a sudden it just started talking to me and swearing at me, I was most put out. After six months of putting up with the rude voice, Tracy confessed to her -year-old primary school teacher daughter the issue she was having. Tracy said: I was in the car with Jade and said aposIaposve got a rude sat navapos.  She found it funny and thought her -year-old brother Ethan was responsible but he hasnapost been near it and it doesnapost sound anything like him. Jade said she was unconvinced the sat nav was actually swearing at her mum but burst out laughing when she heard the foul language for herself. Jade said: I wasnapost convinced that the sat nav was swearing at her, I thought maybe she was mishearing it. Then it did it and I was crying with laughter.  I knew people wouldnapost believe me so I tried recording it, it was really frustrating when I kept missing this voice. I have minutes of video on my phone just trying to capture it and managed to catch it when we arrived at our destination. I confronted Ethan over it and he said he hadnapost touched it.

The -year-old spent years as a domiciliary worker, travelling to people’s homes to administer medication and personal care. But long hours, not being paid for travel and never knowing what her monthly wage would be eventually forced her to quit. Nicola, who juggles work with looking after her daughter at their home in Ashford in Kent is a victim of the UK’s growing gig economy – and she isn’t alone. As she says: “I had to get out. I loved the people, loved caring, but there was never enough time. I didn’t get paid for travel – or the extra time I spent with them because they are so lonely. I’d get home two hours late and was always worried about money.” Next month a new Ken Loach film, Sorry We Missed You, tells the story of people like Nicola. It follows the lives of a care worker and a courier driver, highlighting the damaging effects of these ‘non-jobs’, where zero hours and precarious agency contracts are now the norm.  Fellow care worker, Stevie Hookway, , from Barking in Essex, says she is depressed and in debt because of her job. “You never know how much you’re getting paid. I’ve had to choose which three bills to pay this month,” she says. “You only get paid for the time you spend in a client’s house – not the hour it takes to get there on public transport. I’m in rent arrears already and on top of work pressure, worrying about money is making me depressed.” Sadly Nicola and Stevie’s stories are not unusual – with many British workers being forced to join this insecure gig economy. A staggering . million Brits, almost one in ten working-age adults are now working via a freelance . That’s double the number from , and  per cent are women. The GMB union, one of those that represents British care workers, said its members were ‘undervalued and underpaid’. And a recent cross-party report into social care warns of a ‘workforce crisis’.

Alisha Bartolini, who had just started going to Liverpool Hope University, thought she may have caught aposfreshersapos fluapos following a Halloween night out. But after putting herself to bed the next morning she never woke up. Following the tragedy on November , , her mother Michaela is campaigning to ensure more young people get vaccinated against the infection. She told the Liverpool Echo : It was flu like symptoms - like freshersapos flu from being away from home and the late nights and not eating properly. Itaposs very much flu-ey type symptoms. She got up feeling unwell one morning and she put it down to being hungover from being out at a Halloween party the night before. She got up, had a shower and went back to bed.    Michaela added: She had a headache and was vomiting and everything - she was quite feverish. Thataposs just what you put it down to. Her friends didnapost think anything from it other than her being rough from the night before or coming down with something. It wasnapost in the back of their minds because you associate meningitis with babies and toddlers. Michaela, who said she would do anything to hear Alishaaposs laugh again, is backing a campaign to raise meningitis vaccination rates in Liverpool after figures showed the region has one of the lowest uptake rates in the country.    She said that while one of Alishaaposs friends from home received a letter inviting her for a vaccination, Alisha herself did not receive such information and wasnapost aware of the threat. As the five year anniversary of her daughteraposs death approaches, Michaela remembered what a vibrant, warm and friendly person Alisha was. One of the youngest in her year group, Alisha celebrated her th birthday shortly before moving to Liverpool - and was only at university for five short weeks before her death. Michaela said: At first she was a bit hesitant about going [to university] because she was a family girl but she loved her friends and was very sociable and was looking forward to that side of it.    She would make friends with everyone. I remember moving her into her halls and all the girls on her floor - by the time we left her she was already friends with everyone. She loved a chat. Older teenagers and new university students are at higher risk of infection because many of them mix closely with lots of new people, some of whom may unknowingly carry the meningococcal bacteria at the back of their noses and throats.  Students can get the vaccine via their registered GP surgery or their University Health Centre. Meningitis Now is now carrying out a pilot campaign focusing on Liverpool, with specic efforts to work closely with universities and targeting students with ads on their main bus routes through the city.    Michaela said: “There isn’t a day that goes by when I don’t think about Alisha. “Her le was cut so tragically short andI can help to prevent this happening to even one other young person, I will. “Please make sure you or your child is vaccinated. Please make sure you or they know the signs and symptoms of meningitis. It is a rare disease, but it is also a disease that strikes indiscriminately and strikes fast. Because of this, knowing the signs and symptoms really can be the dference between le and death.” She added: From such a young age, Alisha was always a kind, caring and happy child growing up into a loving, thoughtful and beautul young lady. “She loved spending time between her family and friends, enjoying evenings in at home, particularly with her baby brother or catching up with her friends socially. “But one thing was for certain, Alisha was a aposMother Henapos. She would always make sure others were okay before herself and she just loved taking people aposunder her wingapos.

Stay-at-home mum Edith Garcia was so shocked when her youngest daughter, Tatiana was born as she and her husband, Raul, are of Mexican-American descent. But the couple had both inherited the albinism gene and later discovered that some of their distant relatives have the condition. After doing some thorough research from the National Organisation for Albinism and Hypopigmentation, they found solace in other families going through the same thing. Tatianaaposs albinism means that she has little to no pigmentation which has left her with white hair and fair skin.    Due to her condition she has a lack of pigmentation in her eyes which means she has poor vision, a low depth perception. She has nystagmus, involuntary eye movement, and photophobia, light and glare sensitivity. Edith, , from Calornia, USA, said strangers give them judgemental looks when out with Tatiana, now three and her older sister, Mariah, five. She said: When Tatiana was born, all I could see was this very fair skinned baby girl with really blonde hair I didnapost know what to think. “For a split second, I looked over to my husband and wondered what he did but clearly, it doesnapost work that way. So naturally, I questioned my own decisions. “Personally, I find it funny because I know neither of us would have done such thing but when you look at a blonde baby that comes out of a brown Mexican American mother, you wonder, evenit’s yourself. “The reason why it was a huge shocker was because my husband and I had no idea that we inherited the albinism gene and that there are known relatives with albinism.    “After she was born, my mother asked my grandfatherhe knew of any relatives and he confirmed that there were, but they were at least five generations back. My husbandaposs side was similar, distant cousins but not close enough to have known the possibilities. She added: Tatiana knows that she is special she is used to the attention that she gets from strangers and doesnapost seem to mind it. “She knows itaposs mostly because of her white hair as that is what usually people say. I think itaposs important too for her to feel confident and know that she is special in her own way but still the same. So far, it seems like she gets it. “Mariah was four years old when she really started to notice people staring at her sister and asked why. I explained to her that a lot of people havenapost seen a little girl with white hair and that is very special. “She is a great help to her little sister we often remind her that Tatiana may need help transitioning to new locations. Mariah has had shirts stating that her little sister has albinism.”    She added: I quickly learned that albinism was not very common amongst us and not a lot of people including myself knew anything about it. “I have read and seen some very heartbreaking things towards people with albinism and thataposs when it clicked. “I will do everything in my power to raise awareness for Tatiana and every person that follows her. We are in this albinism community and together we will raise awareness. “I believe everything happens for a reason so being a mama to a little girl with albinism has always been Godaposs plan. “I have made it a point to teach anyone that comes across as interested and eager to learn with the continuous support of our friends and family. “I think itaposs cute that she feels beautul and knows how special she is but it is more important that she knows her inner beauty.

Mum-of-two Tian Ying delivered her daughter by C-section with the help of doctors Wang Xietong and Liu Chengwen at Zaozhuang Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital in East China on the morning of October . The child was born at , grammesand is in a healthy and stable condition while continuing to be monitored in the neonatal intensive care unit. Ms Tian is a former paediatrics nurse of the hospital. She remained conscious during the caesarean section and is being kept in the ICU. Her husband, Huang Heping, , was there to greet her as she was wheeled out of surgery in front of local media.    The new dad revealed that their son and daughter, the oldest of whom is , had cut ties with them over their decision to keep the girl who they have chosen to name Tianci - Mandarin for ‘heaven-sent. Mr Huang, a lawyer, said: “We’ve named her Tianci, because she was a gt from god.I hope she likes her name in the future.”  He suggested the high-risk pregnancy was not planned, saying: “Had we really wanted another child, we’d have done so much earlier. “We wouldn’t have waited until she was so old. It was an accident.” Of the couple’s several grandchildren, their oldest granddaughter is now  and starting university.    It means Tianci’s niece is  years her senior, and her sister is  years older too. Ms Tian, who worked as a nurse in the same hospital’s paediatrics ward, reportedly admitted to local media she would not choose to keep the childshe was given a second opportunity. She was quoted as saying: “It was painful, far too painful. It hurt so much, I couldn’t keep my eyes open.” On the prospect of passing away before her newborn daughter comes of age, she added: “We have to raise her to adulthood at all costs. We’re going to try live to .” The new mum said she would not rely on her children or grandchildren to help, and would raise the girl using her and her husband’s pension. Doctor Wang, who was consulting from Jinan Maternity and Child Care Hospital in the provincial capital, told local media shortly after stepping out of surgery: “The operation went very smoothly.    “Two problems arose during surgery, but we had foreseen them, and they weren’t very serious. “They were dealt with quickly, and both mother and child are safe. To conceive naturally and successfully carry the pregnancy to term at  - I’ve not seen a case like that.” Doctor Wang did not say whether the hospital was able to very the couple’s claim that the girl was naturally conceived. Buttheir claim is true, it would make Ms Tian the oldest woman to conceive naturally in China. According to reports, she is already China’s oldest new mother after overtaking a -year-old woman who gave birth to a baby boy in  in Changchun, capital of north-eastern Jilin Province. Zaozhuang Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital’s records show that Ms Tian first discovered she was pregnant during an examination in Beijing on th April this year.

Muzaffar Ghanghro has been charged with negligence, manslaughter and causing unintentional harm following the outbreak in the small city of Ratodero in April. The paediatrician, believed to have been charging p per visit for the areaaposs poorest parents,  works as a GP at a government hospital. So far , people are positive for the virus but health officials fear the number of those infected could be far higher as less than a quarter of the cityaposs , population has been tested.    The outbreak came to light when residents fell sick with fevers that resisted treatment, leading to a frenzied panic as they rushed to get tested for the virus. Health officials then revealed that many of the infected children had gone to the same paediatrician, Ghanghro. Local journalist Gulbahar Shaikh got his children tested as they had been treated by the suspect and was horried to discover his two-year-old daughter had the virus.    Another resident, Imtiaz Jalbani, said Ghanghro treated all six of his children and four of them contracted HIV.His -month-old child and three-year-old daughter have now died. He alleges that he saw the paediatrician rummage through rubbish for a syringe to use on his six-year-old son - who also has the virus - and that when confronted Ghanghro claimed he was only doing so because Mr Jalbani was too poor to pay for a new one, according to The New York Times. Ghanghro reportedly insisted he is innocent and never reused syringes, and health officials have said he is unlikely to be the only cause of the outbreak, as there was evidence of numerous doctors reusing syringes.

What I’ve seen since coming back is the mentality of the club changing.”And Butcher is calling on the fans to turn out in their numbers tomorrow as the Tangerines look to maintain their perfect home record on the back of three away defeats.And that kind of form, performing at two ends of the spectrum is something he and the rest of the squad are keen to put right.Butcher added: “All I can say to the fans is they need to get behind us still and they’re going to be our driving force to get us to where we need to be.“We need to make sure we’re not performing at two extremes.“We’ve been really extreme this season, going back and forth with results. The - derby win and - against Morton and then going away and losing two on the spin, you never see that coming but, ultimately, it’s about theof the season.“There’s a long way to go yet. There’s some big games coming up and people are going to drop points but we just need to go on a four, five, six-game run and make sure we’re all together, pulling in the right direction. Turnarounds from defeats can make a season.”Of opponents the Pars, Butcher added: “The last time we played them we identied that they were a strong side.“We also know that every team who plays us wants to beat us more than any other team in this league. We are the scalp in the league as such.“We need to be at % to be dominating and beating teams.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-remember-arnotts-st-enochs-square","story":"A street view of Arnott Simpsons on Argyle Street and St Enoch Square in  is among our memories today."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-slammed-making-notre-dame-decision-ahead-final-report","story":"A LABOUR councillor has slammed her SNP colleagues for voting on the future of Scotland last state funded girls school before seeing a final report on the matter."},{"url":null,"title":"men-sought-celtic-treble-treble-celebrations-disorder","story":"Police Scotland have released images of  men they would like to speak to following \"acts of disorder\" in Glasgow city centre."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-thomas-cook-staff-making-holiday-dreams-come-true-hays-travel","story":"The collapse of Thomas Cook shocked the country last month, but none more so than its ever-loyal staff."},{"url":null,"title":"disgraced-celtic-boys-club-youth-coach-allegedly-preyed-youngster-glasgow-toy-shop","story":"Disgraced youth football coach Jim Torbett sexually abused a young player in a Maryhill toy shop while another man watched, it has been claimed."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-singer-esosa-max-who-praised-music-legend-cher","story":"Music legend Cher has hailed the stunning voice of Glasgow singer Vianvi Esosa Max-Who after sharing a clip of her belting out a Whitney Houston classic on a city street."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/bb109f45-c1f1-40c7-aeab-0abe61645ed8-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/bb109f45-c1f1-40c7-aeab-0abe61645ed8-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/bb109f45-c1f1-40c7-aeab-0abe61645ed8-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/bb109f45-c1f1-40c7-aeab-0abe61645ed8-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen university to host green art exhibition","story":"An north-east art exhibition focused on sustainable energy is to begin next week.Aberdeen University Students’ Associationgroup AberGreen is hosting the event, which is scheduled to take place on November .A call for submissions was made earlier this month, with the brief ‘what you think of when you hear sustainable energy, or renewable energy sources ’.Winners of the competition will be showcased in the exhibition, which will run from November  until  at the students’ union building.Judging will take place from today until November ."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5db1d339442a18.51269345-406x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet xxx xxx and xxxxx are looking for a new home can you help 2","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.Vulcan likes to be the boss and will need a strong experienced owner who will not let him always get his own way.He can be very excitable around people but can also be temperamental and will growl or snap when being told off.He is not suitable to be rehomed around children or other animals.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for

Council will be asked rethink its controversial playparks proposals, following two petitions that were signed by over a thousand concerned residents.In May , the council agreed plans to consult on the possible closure of  small playparks it says are underused and falling into disrepair.Instead, the council plans to spend poundm over the next decade on six large playparks, three skateparks and four fitness shelters.However, following a backlash from residents in Hawick and Kelso, two petitions have been handed into the local authority objecting to the plans.Nine Kelso playparks are at risk of closure: High Croft Meadow Court Orchard Park Rosewood Gardens Springwood Rise Spylaw Park Sydenham Court Woodside Gardens and the Kelso petition has attracted  signatures.Ten playparks are at risk in Hawick: Bowden Road Burnfoot School Hawick Green Hislop Gardens Leaburn Drive Mayfield Millers Knowe Waverley Walk Wellington Court and Wilson Drive and the Hawick petition has attracted  signatures.Those petitions were presented to the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee today, October , so it could hear from the lead petitioners and decide how to respond.Appearing before the committee, Kirsty Wichary, lead petitioner for Kelso, told councillors: ldquoWhat do we want our towns to look like in the future  Financial constraints aside, do we not look to have a beautul

The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"pm-says-commons-incapable-delivering-brexit-urges-mps-back-poll","story":"Boris Johnson has said the House of Commons is ldquoincapable of delivering Brexit as he urged MPs to back his plan for a pre-Christmas general election.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions. Most notably, George received the MBE from Her Majesty at Buckingham Palace on December , , ‘for services to the community in Campbeltown, Argyll and Bute.’Maureen Keith, daughter of the Provost, handing over a bouquet to the Queen after the presentation ceremony.

His grandfather watched, wishing he too could join in the fun. But age had crept up on him. His joints tweaked with pain every time he tried to behave like his younger self, making him very cautious. So he found a rock on which to sit and watched over his grandson as he explored.His thoughts were taken away from the beach and he began to think of his we. She had dearly loved their grandson but sadly she was only an image in a photograph for her grandson now. He was too young when she died to have any real memories of her. It was at moments like this that he missed her most, for she loved the beach.

His granddad rose from his rock and walked over to him.ldquoCome on granddad, jump the waves with me, he called out, his face beaming with joy.

We still recognise that as we have always said these interventions have to be considered part of a live trial and very much hoping it has a positive impact on the beach.ldquoFor residents and visitors, the beach has historically been a real draw.ldquoI think everybody who has been involved recognises that it has a very signicant economic value to the town."},{"url":null,"title":"hygiene-order-served-business","story":"East Lothian Council environmental health officers served a hygiene emergency prohibition notice on Stirling Stewart, operator of a food preparation unit at Halfland Barns Industrial Estate, to the south of the town, on August , resulting in the immediate closure of the premises.The premises were not known to environmental health prior to visiting following a complaint from a member of the public.Derek Oliver, service manager, protective services, said: ldquoOfficers found the premises in such a poor condition that it posed a serious risk to public health and they immediately closed it.ldquoThe premises were filthy with a build-up of dirt and food debris, unclean food equipment, accumulation of waste and poor drainage.ldquoThe food unit was being used to supply other food businesses operated by Mr Stewart in North Berwick.In a hearing at Edinburgh Sherf Court on Tuesday, the Sherf upheld the action of the environmental health officers and confirmed the actions to immediately close the premises were legally correct.Mr Oliver added: ldquoEast Lothian Councilrsquos environmental health officers will exercise their legal powers to protect public health within the county.ldquoWe routinely inspect all food premises and expect them to comply with food hygiene regulations.ldquoIn this case the premises were so dirty and structurally poor that they required to be closed immediately as they fell far below the legally required standards."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-power-riddles","story":"THE person who uses it never sees it, the person who makes it doesnrsquot use it, the person who pays for it wishes it wasnrsquot needed. What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council. It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

particularly attractive.However, ward colleague Councillor Norman Hampshire was backed by the committeersquos other two members ndash Jeremy Findlay and Stuart Currie ndash in backing the plans, which were then given final approval by the Scottish Government, with conditions from Transport Scotland.Discussions surrounding the sculpture have been ongoing for more than two years, with the plans splitting the townrsquos community council when they were discussed.Pippa Swan, now chairwoman of the group, originally said: ldquoFor me it is a bizarre proposal and it looks like a polar bear or like an advertisement for a safari park.Fellow community councillor Herbert Coutts was more positive and pointed to the impact of the Kelpies and the Angel of the North, near Gateshead.He said: ldquoI know at the time the Kelpies were being proposed there was a lot of opposition to that but now they are being recognised as being icons for Scotland.ldquoI drive along that road very regularly and

since he suffered a heart attack in .Andrew, , said the heart attack ldquocame from nowhere and blew my socks off.He said: ldquoTo be honest, the first few months that followed my heart attack were a bit challenging.ldquoI was permanently exhausted and scared to breathe, never mind walk any distance and I relied entirely on the support of family and friends during this period.ldquoI was also fortunate in that my employers were most supportive.ldquoI am doing [the Law walking challenge] to inspire people who have had a heart attack or have heart diseases that post-event you can still get out there.ldquoI was always thinking during my months of convalescence,I could just one day climb back up to the top then I would have sufficient fitness to do most things that I might want to do in the future.ldquoOn New Yearrsquos Day , I stood on the summit with family and friends and, given that I didnrsquot keel over and no bits fell off me, I figured I might just be back in the game!ldquoFrom there a germ of an idea was sown: would it be possible for me to climb the Law  times in a year  Irsquove now done it nearly  times.The -year-old got off to a bad start this year as his dog Lottie knocked herself out by running headfirst into a large boulder on the first day of the  challenge, with Andrew explaining that she had missed some walks since the incident.Andrew, a practice director at a national asset management firm in Edinburgh and a father-of-three, often goes on his walks very early in the morning or late at night.He said: ldquoI have met a lot of interesting people with very interesting stories. It has been a lot of fun so far.ldquoI donrsquot want to do it to be all lsquolook at me, Irsquom greatrsquo, I just want to be inspiring.ldquoThe Law doesnrsquot get any easier to climb, though!When explaining why he has only now gone public with his challenge and set up a JustGiving page, he said: ldquoI didnrsquot think I could do it and stick it out.ldquoI feel that I can now get through the next two and a half months and I can see the finishing line on the horizon.Andrew has had plenty of support along the way, with his three children joining him on walks and we Victoria supporting him on the ground his -year-old mum has also expressed her wish to join Andrew on one of his walks.Andrew is also inviting people to join him, saying ldquoit would be greatanybody with or without heart disease would like to join me on one of my strolls up the Law.ldquoWhilst I have to fit my hikes around work commitments during the week, I tend to leave from the car park gate at am most Saturdays and Sundays, he added.To donate visit justgiving fundraising lawchallenge"},{"url":null,"title":"parents-staff-upset-schools-bee-garden-mown","story":"The garden which was built by youngsters at the school was part of a nationwide project to support insects on or near the John Muir Way.However, pictures taken during the October holiday show the area of land has been cut and flower heads left lying in the grass cuttings.One image shared on social media brought a stunned response from parents and teaching staff alike, who questioned why the garden had been damaged.One said: ldquoMy now P daughter is very upset.

Despite the objection of the Democratic Unionist Partyand anti-abortion crusaders, it was ruled that from midnight it would be legal to have an abortion in Northern Ireland, as in the Republic of Ireland, as in the rest of the UK.With the passage of this legislation, women in the first  weeks of pregnancy who wish to have a termination will no longer have to skulk out of the country, or purchase online pills, rendering them open to prosecution should these make them so unwell they require medical attention.After next April, following an interim period during which access to services on the mainland will be freely available, the situation in Northern Ireland will change radically. Those who are pregnant as a result of incest or rape those who know their foetus has an incurable disease that will allow them little quality of le for as long as they survive those who have been told they must go full term, even though the baby has died, will finally be given a degree of dignity and comfort. At last, they will be able to end a pregnancy of their own volition, in their homeland, without stigma and with the full support of the medical professionals who tend to them.It is a not a subject for wild rejoicing, as was evident in the sombre response of campaigners on learning the law had been passed. The mood was more of relief than jubilation. Nobody can feel joy at the idea of a pregnancy that, for whatever reason, is better ended.But it is possible to feel gratitude that an old and crippling injustice, a hangover of a puritanical stranglehold on womenrsquos lives, has been overturned. As of now, Northern Irish women are entitled to decide on their own welfare and that of their unborn child. It is a right that is not only legal but ethical.That these new laws are among the most liberal in Europe is remarkable, given the strength and tenacity of opposition to this issue. It must exacerbate the fury of the anti-abortion camp to watch the political mothership in London impose its will with such vigour.That this has happened under a Conservative government with which the DUP was in partnership, is an added grievance. As is the fact that even the Republic of Ireland, once a by-word for religious conservatism, last year voted to allow terminations . This volte face was salt in the wound for pro-lers and pro-choice activists alike.The measure of how historic this landmark will prove can be gauged by the opening of the padlock on the Assemblyrsquos gates. Sinn Fein did not turn up, but Arlene Forster, leader of the DUP, announced that, despite this act, her party would explore ldquoevery possible legal option to prevent the provision of abortion services within their borders.A fuming zealot was less restrained: ldquoin todayrsquos world the most dangerous place to be is actually in the womb of a woman. There could hardly be a more calculated insult to womankind, but the depth of this manrsquos misogyny highlights the intensity of prejudice and oppression with which the pro-choice lobby has had to contend.This momentous step is good news for the United Kingdom, as is impending legislation to allow same-sex marriage from next January. All this is positive. Yet it is a sad day for the Union that both decisions, which will have far-reaching social implications, are not the work of Irish politicians but of Westminster.Since the Assembly collapsed in January , its day to day business has been handled by civil servants. You might argue they are doing such a good job they are enabling Sinn Fein and the DUP to maintain their stand-off. That not even the murder of the journalist Lyra McKee could encourage these parties to put aside their quarrel indicates the bitterness and ision at the heart of Irish politics.Yet while the Assembly has been lying all these months in an induced coma, London has not been idle. Those on the pro-choice side of the debate might have mixed feelings, since their argument has been vindicated thanks to action by the English. Time was when anything that came out of Westminster was regarded in certain quarters as toxic. How ironic, then, that the Assemblyrsquos denizens have allowed their internal wrangling, their myopia and obstinacy, to allow an often loathed overlord to step into their shoes and usher voters into a more compassionate age.That must be galling for everyone. Then again, perhaps not. When Stormont reconvened for the space of roughly an hour, squabbling made any hope of constitutional challenge impossible. It was hardly edying. Rather than acting as a reminder that the Assemblyrsquos members have the power to settle the countryrsquos affairs without interference from outside, it was instead a shambles, a pantomime whose script had been lted straight from the myth of Pandorarsquos Box.I would not be surprised , following this, some are wonderingthey should dispense with the Assembly altogether, since they are better served by panjandrums across the sea. Others, meanwhile, will be looking south towards the Republic, anticipating the time when old isions are lted, and all of Ireland is united peacefully once more.What lies between now and that day, should it ever arrive, will be turbulent, to say the least. For the meantime, it is paradox enough that it has taken Westminster to unlock the chains in which Northern Irelandrsquos women have been shackled. The symbolic signicance of this long overdue act should give the refusniks at Stormont pause for thought."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10590284.jpg?type=article-full","title":"guide-cosiest-pubs-around-scotland","story":"Cugravel Cugraveil, GlasgowYou canrsquot get much cosier than Cugravel Cugraveil - Glasgowrsquos only heated and covered City Centre winter garden.The Cugraveils cosy, intimate vibe and unique atmosphere is second to none.

But Britainrsquos adversarial system was supposed to preclude that. Until now.Thanks to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the government canrsquot simply call an election when it chooses, or when it loses votes in the Commons, as this one has done repeatedly. It has to win a two-thirds majority, which places the initiative in the hands of the opposition.Alternatively, a government of national unity could take over after a confidence vote, which comes to the same thing.Labour has been demanding a General Election for the past two years, but somehow canrsquot quite get round to voting for one, or moving a vote of no confidence in the government.In a very real sense, the opposition has been keeping this government on le support.Jeremy Corbyn said he wouldnrsquot vote for a General Election until a no-deal Brexit, which Boris Johnson had threatened for October , was ldquotaken off the table by the Benn Act.The Benn Act passed, the letter was sent, Brussels has signalled an extension and no deal is off the table.But Labour are now saying they want no deal to be taken off the table even after that extension. It wants an indefinite extension of Article , or a law saying that the UK will never be faced with a hard Brexit.Labourrsquos justication for these transparent delaying tactics is that ldquoyou canrsquot trust anything Boris Johnson says. Well, few might disagree.But the only way to remove this serial liar is by an election. And, short of a Labour government in perpetuity, it is not possible in a democracy to rule out no deal forever.No UK government can be bound by acts of a previous administration. The only way to rule out no deal indefinitely would be to revoke Article , or vote for the deal.Labour has always voted against revocation and, indeed, condemned Jo Swinson as ldquoNigel Faragersquos little helper when the LibDem conference voted to revoke Article  without a referendum.Hopes rose and fell last week that the Remainers might finally get their repeat referendum when the Withdrawal Bill passed Second Reading.Some hoped that they could tag a referendum amendment. But it was not to be.First, there needs to be government legislation to hold a referendum, not least because it involves expense, and Boris Johnsonrsquos government will never legislate for a referendum.Second, there is no majority in the Commons for a referendum, which is why the Peoples Vote campaign decided not to try a referendum vote on Super Saturday .Third: there is no clarity on what the question would be. Remainers want the deal versus Remain. But Leave voters would never accept that.Theyrsquoll demand that no deal must be on the ballot paperRemain is on it. Donrsquot expect the Electoral Commission or the Supreme Court to sort that one out.I suppose Brussels could simply say: well, wersquoll revoke Article  for you ndash but that might look just a little like dictatorship.They canrsquot undo Article  anyway because it was triggered by that vote in the UK Parliament in  when MPs, including Labour, voted to leave by a majority of .Thatrsquos where our problems really began.French president Emmanuel Macron has made clear that the Benn Act extension until February , the third, must be justied by a ldquodemocratic event ie a General Election or a referendum.But Brexitus Interruptus has now infected Brussels as well.Last week, the EU withheld a decision on theof the extension because they want to seeParliament votes for a General Election tomorrow.But since Westminster is waiting for a ruling from Brussels on the extension, we have found ourselves on a diplomatic equivalent of MC Escherrsquos Endless Staircase.For some reason, the UK opposition parties believed Boris Johnson when he said he would rather ldquodie in a ditch than extend Britainrsquos membership of the EU beyond October .Boris Johnson is notoriously unreliable, so why they believed this is a mystery.What ditch did they expect him to fall into  Did they expect him to have a nervous breakdown and resign Johnson did what yoursquod expect him to do, which is ignore what hersquod said and reframe the question: itrsquos not him in the ditch but Labour, for refusing to agree to the General Election.ldquoBut he said hersquod never send the letter complain Labour supporters on social media.Again, Johnson just amended the record, sent the Benn letter to Brussels along with a covering note saying itrsquos not government policy and that he wouldnrsquot co-operate.Itrsquos what this column said he would do all along.Labour are now horribly exposed because they somehow didnrsquot bargain on Johnson turning the extension against them.The opposition is now split.

studied composition at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, graduating in , and has since worked across a wide range of disciplines, including solo electronic music and film scoring.He has been commissioned to create a piece of work of artistic value and relevance concerning Suilven and he will be creating a sound work that draws upon the mountainrsquos ldquogeography and sonic ecology.The

which has already had a big impact on him and his work.He wrote on his mountain blog: The opportunity to come to Suilven, spend time in the area and produce new work in response to it was very attractive for a number of reasons.ldquoA big one is that for an artist making the kind of work that I make, chances to spend time and work in a relatively remote part of the country are few and far

the area a soundscape unlike anywhere , and will also guide someone exploring that soundscape to listen from new, dfering perspectives.ldquoAll these elements combining convinced me that this would be a great opportunity to not only make something interesting and exciting but also make me think about what I do and how I do it in new ways.Mr Mackay has spent the last few months travelling between Glasgow and Assynt to collect recordings as he interprets Suilven through the medium of sound.The peak has already captured the imaginations of many.Legendary climber Sir Chris Bonington named it as the mountain that most shaped his le for top travel guide Wanderlust.The mountain was also immortalised last year in the film Edie, in which Sheila Hancock stars as an octogenarian who makes a

landscape of bog and bare granite, he said.ldquoI first climbed Suilven back when I was  and it is one of the most magical days I have ever had.ldquoIt was my second holiday in Scotland, just after I

Why  Because the basic obstacle to success was not understood. It is that the EU will not allow a deal advantageous to the UK. It set out to damage us to encourage other countries to remain. It has as as good as said \"you cannot leave because we must have a hard border\", which it knows is impossible and which the DUP, which wishes to be integral in every way to the UK, would never approve or support in a Commons vote.Successive prime ministers have been in an impossible position because of the limits of what the EU will allow. Decency from the EU disappeared with the vote to leave. Aided and abetted by the fth column of MPs who then reneged on their promises to support the referendum result and have been subverting it ever since with one amendment after another, every one dishonest: holding up the process hoping for a reversal, a morally indefensible move. They even bleat \"we are acting for the good of the country. We are the democrats here . The damage will be colossal.\" The notion that only damage can result is a hysteria fomented by them. But it has not succeeded. People, the majority, want to see Brexit delivered.There was, with hindsight, only one possible move by the UK which could have led to a successful Brexit: leave with no deal. Then the UK is not subject to EU rules or courts and can carve out for itself what its arrangements will be. For sure, the EU will be arriving in droves to re-establish trade, because it will not do without it. Let it make the trade deals. We seek to trade with the wide world and refuse to be restricted.

But I was not laughing at Kevin. For there was a third participant in this discussion - James Mills, a former adviser to Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell.Jamesrsquo first intervention in the discussion was to excoriate Jim Cusick, an experienced lobby journalist formerly of the Independent, the Sunday Times and the BBC. Immediately before the discussion between James, Kevin and I, Jim provided an analysis which included the internal misgivings inside Labour about Corbynrsquos fitness for office. It was a highly partisan response to a highly non-partisan analysis.Now, I should clary that I am not proud of myself for chuckling, and I did not do so out of any malice towards James. Hersquos a highly politically motivated person, which is to be admired, as well as a husband and a father, which is to be admired more.

The role of the journalist is, to put it simplistically, to inform viewers, listeners and readers of what they understand to be happening. This may not always be perfectly balanced, depending on the focus of the topic. And, indeed, I do not expect the contribution of journalists to be impartial, either, because their publications are not. So we might expect the interpretation of, say, ajournalist to a piece of breaking news on Brexit to be dferent than that of, say, ajournalist. The expectation, though, would be that a journalist would happily turn their hand to any story irrespective of whom it involved Brexiter or Remainer, Unionist or Nationalist, and so on.There is a key test, here and it is this: as a consumer of the news that they produce, I should not know how a journalist votes, whether in elections or referendums. That is the crucial dference between a journalist and a commentator. As soon as it becomes clear how they vote, they have ceased to become a journalist and bled into the commentary.:Scottish independence: Indyref will be focus of SNP election campaign says Nicola SturgeonIn this, I must say, I think that Peter Obornersquos criticism of a couple of particular journalists - the BBCrsquos Laura Kuenssberg and ITVrsquos Robert Peston - was wrong. His insinuation that they effectively swallow lies from Downing Street is off-the-mark because their job as journalists is to report what they are hearing from politicians and campaigns, whether that be Downing Street or the opposition. Both of those iniduals fit my description of journalists rather well.However, not all of their colleagues fit it, with too many having morphed into being partisan commentators. Those of us observing the media in Scotland would have been able to see this coming since . Referendums, as we all now know, are destructive things. They ide families, workplaces and society. And in the highly charged political environment they produce, the integration of journalism and commentary has gone almost unnoticed.It is now commonplace in the pages of national newspapers to see print and broadcast journalists giving us their opinion, rather than simply their analysis , in a first-person column.That journey - from journalist to commentator - is often mirrored at the other end of the spectrum as commentators morph into activists. It is here where we canto the example of Saturdayrsquos radio debate. Commentators are very commonly people who have a political history. This rather goes with the territory - anyone with enough interest in the detail of politics to qualy as a commentator has probably been around a political party in their past.There is no wrongdoing in the audience knowing what a commentatorrsquos opinions and voting patterns are, but they are entitled to expect that he or she will be able to offer a semi-detached perspective on the story. They should be able to go beyond the spin and tell the audience what sits behind it, analysing its potential effects in a thoughtful and, importantly, unemotional way.But just as there is a critical dference between a journalist and a commentator, the same dference exists between a good commentator and an activist. Emotional, blinkered, one-sided interpretations which show an inability to understand another perspective are a sign that you are consuming the views of an activist rather than a commentator. On Saturday, it was clear that Kevin and I fitted into the box of commentator, whereas Jamesis clearly an activist.I know that this might not seem important. But it is, now more than ever. This blurring of the distinction between journalists, commentators and activists goes right to the heart of public trust. Now more than ever, we are dependent on the media to help the public in the navigation of the most isive issue in our collective political memories.For me, broadcast and print media get a \"must try harder\" mark. They need to understand who they are commissioning, and why. They must decide before they pick up the phone what they want their  to be - journalism, commentary, or activism. All are legitimate, but all are dferent and should not be mixed.Modern politics is corrosive enough letrsquos not make it worse in the media.

families under constant stress and pressure because of poverty-related issues. Aberlour has found that the best way to support families to achieve more positive outcomes for their children is to sit alongside them, in their own homes and communities, and ask the most basic questions: ldquoWhat do you think will make the biggest dferent in your le and how can we help  With , children living in poverty in Scotland, and numbers growing, Aberlour needs help to reach the families that require their support.ldquoWe commissioned a piece of research in an attempt to get closer to the impact of poverty on families, ldquo says SallAnn Kelly, chief executive. ldquoWe hear a lot about overall le expectancy in Scotland, but we wanted to get nearer to the le expectancy issues around young people and young adults. Dr Morag Treanor, professor of child and family inequalities at Edinburghrsquos Heriot-Watt University, looked at what the statistics tell us about the outcome for children and young people. She revelated that for those children born into the most deprived communities in Scotland, compared to those who are born in the most affluent, the children from the poorest communities are three times more likely to die before they reach the age of . Three-times more likely to die ndash just take a moment to think about thathellip and that is in a country which as part of the UK, is the sixth richest in the world.What is even more shocking about this statistic is it only applies to avoidable deaths. It doesnrsquot take into account losses from childhood cancer or other long-term illnesses that result in death.ldquoWe had to think about what we could do to redouble our efforts as a charity to support children and families across Scotland, adds SallyAnn. ldquowhat we know is that the earlier you get to families to support them, the more likely they are to thrive. We know that poverty in Scotland is not the sole responsibility of the Scottish Government. Therersquos a much wider societal response we need so there are other things we are looking at.SallyAnn points to the responsibilities of business in terms of creating a fairer more flexible arrangements for staff. That means providing good quality employment opportunities and secure employment in family friendly environments.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos own figures state that about % of the , children in poverty in Scotland live in families where there is a working adult. So letrsquos explode the myth about a lack of a work ethic. There is a work ethic, itrsquos just that too many people canrsquot secure the higher paid and more secure jobs. They have to make daily decisions between keeping the lights on, putting food on the table, or buying unorms for the kids to go to school.ldquoWhen it comes to zero-hours contracts, families tell us the insecurity of not knowing when they are working and how many hours they are working creates a huge amount of stress. Itrsquos stress that families are dealing with day in and day out that creates a real pressure on the relationships within the family. We know the quality of relationships children have within their families is critical to overall wellbeing.Looking at the responsibilities of the government, SallyAnn says that whether itrsquos national or local government, more needs to be done to challenge poverty and its consequences. There are restrictions about public money and how it is used. Political decisions shape these restrictions and we are challenging all decision makers to focus on child wellbeing when they make political choices. Aberlour is asking the public to think really seriously about the implications of poverty ndash especially for each one of those ,.ldquoThere is a view that the parents of children in poverty somehow have dferent aspirations for their children. The research that we have seen demonstrates clearly that is not the case. No-one gives birth to a child in the hope that they fail.ldquoWhat happens is that the opportunities that are available to my children or many other peoplersquos children are somehow closed to children living in poverty. That is not down to the families itrsquos the system that they find themselves in. Professionals can have lower expectations of children from poorer backgrounds, whether thatrsquos in education or any other setting these children find themselves. So by the time they are teenagers some of these young people feel absolutely hopeless.Without opportunities children from poor communities have little chance of escaping poverty. SallyAnn points to a girl names Morgan, who has appeared in much of Aberlourrsquos campaign materials. She grew up in a very challenging family situation in Glasgowrsquos Govan area. Having to deal with dficulties at home and a social environment that screamed lsquoyou will amount to nothing, therersquos no pointrsquo was only overcome thanks to intensive support from Aberlourrsquos Glasgow Family Support service. Today, Morgan has beaten the odds and is the first in her family to attend university ndash she is training to become a family lawyer to help others.ldquoWe want to say to the public, what would you want for your familythey were living in circumstances where opportunities were close off to your children  adds SallyAnn.ldquoIf you can, please help us with a regular gt that can go towards providing an army of support workers to help families right across Scotland. We need to be there for the long-term, standing shoulder to shoulder with the children and young people that we support and that require an ongoing financial commitment.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmFolk in the isles are being invited to get together over the coming weeks to discuss how to keep our islands stoat free.

The new agreement has been criticised by commentators for undermining the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking in the house yesterday, Mr Carmichael asked: “The creation of a customs border down the Irish Sea and the necessary declarations as a consequence of that is something about which Ruth Davidson and the former Secretary of State for Scotland warned last year.#They said then, and it’s true now, that it will undermine the Union. Why is the Secretary of State disregarding his Rt Hon Friend’s advice ”Responding in the house, the secretary of state said: “This is a deal that protects the border, this was a key priority for me as Secretary of State. It protects the peace process. The economy of Northern Ireland, I think, will benefit from this deal . . . and I would work over the implementation period to minimise any problems for Northern Ireland businesses in exporting and selling into Great Britain.”Responding after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The Secretary of State’s response was muddled and confused. It shows once again that the Conservative Party is now so fixated with Brexit that it is blind to the damage that they risk doing to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The lack of concern shown by the Government about this issue is deeply concerning.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The research discovered that almost universally, those asked thought that the ‘deal’ being examined at Westminster represented not just the terms of our withdrawal from the European Union but the entirety our future trading and political relationship with the bloc.When told that this was just the beginning and that Brexit itself would trigger years of detailed, high-stakes negotiations and trade talks– the response was a “horried silence”.It demonstrates the mistaken, yet widely held belief that “getting Brexit done” will conclude with the passage of a withdrawal agreement. Yet in reality, the wrangling, the double-dealing and the persistent threat of crashing out without a deal after the transition period are set to go on and on and on.: Brexit: Boris Johnson is learning same lessons as Theresa May – Ian Swanson: Brexit: England seems to be declaring independence from UK – Angus RobertsonPart of the cause of this confusion is that very few political parties are being straight with the public right now, either about what is going on in the Brexit endgame, or how they feel about it.Take the Prime Minister. In , Theresa May proposed what was, effectively, the same withdrawal agreement as the one on the table right now. She was derided for it by both Boris Johnson and the Brexiteer wing of the Conservative Party. DoublethinkNow he is at the helm, Johnson has discovered the unassailable boundaries of Brexit and has reheated the same solution to the Irish border problem. Northern Ireland will be both simultaneously inside and outside of the EU customs union, depending on your point of view – “Schrödinger’s Ulster” as the commentator Alex Massie recently put it.Scottish Tories have rushed to embrace this policy and with it the doublethink of their new leader. When Theresa May first proposed special treatment for Northern Ireland in its relationship with the EU, Ruth Davidson and David Mundell threatened to resign their positions in response to the threat they believed it represented to the Union.But a poll of Tory members earlier this year suggested that delivering Brexit was more important to them than preventing Scottish independence. The self-proclaimed s of the Union are now pedalling a policy that dramatically heightens the risk of another Scottish border poll and all that comes with it.The mask is beginning to slip for the SNP as well. For three years, Nicola Sturgeon has sought to court Remain voters who voted No in . She’s been desperate to point to independence as a leboat back to the EU . But the First Minister’s ‘stop Brexit’ credentials are starting to ring rather hollow.It emerged last week that her party spent considerably more money chasing , votes in the Shetland by-election than they did campaigning for . million votes in the EU referendum. And people have forgotten that it took them nearly two years to join the campaign for a referendum on the final terms of Brexit. Now that a second referendum might just make it into the Withdrawal Billthey have gone strangely quiet on that front. Instead they appeared to have opted for a swashbuckling push for a snap General Election out of what appears to be a narrow self-interest.No wonder people find politics infuriating right now. They just want political parties to be straight with them about the seismic choices we face as a nation. That starts by reminding them in no uncertain terms that the best deal we could ever hope to strike with the EU is the one we currently enjoy as a full and active member and that the best way to “get Brexit done” is to do away with Brexit completely.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s time to celebrate all of scotland s best buildings even concrete car parks","story":"These carefully designed buildings show us how we live, not only in the latter half of the th century but also today ndash and all these buildings continue to have a positive use.

Will the media cover it, despite ignoring previous All Under One Banner marches – even though their crowds might have been bigger  Of course, the cameras will turn up, and it’s quite right they should be there. But why has the First Minister felt compelled to co-organise her own rally, after a conspicuous failure to join the foot-soldiers slogging up and down high streets theand breadth of Scotland these past years Obviously, controlling her own gig, lets Nicola Sturgeon ensure that a former socialist leader doesn’t grace the . It also lets her choose a signicant date –two days after Boris Johnson’s failure to “do or die”. : Outrage as Scottish Tory MSP accuses Nicola Sturgeon of being anti-EnglishWith support for the SNP and independence slowly rising, that’s an ideal moment for the SNP leader to seize the initiative, and name her preferred day, week or month for indyref in  – eventhere’s very little chance of a Section  order from any Conservative-led UK government.The dance has begun – and the moves must continue.But there’s another reason Nicola Sturgeon will finally speak at an independence rally: the Yes movement has brought her there. No political leader could continue to ignore the unparalleled levels of street activism from her own side without looking detached, disapproving or a wee bit lofty. All Under One Banner, despite internal wrangles, no big cash and no media coverage, have provided a physical focus for half of Scotland’s population inclined towards independence. And there’s plenty more self-starting, vigorous, independence-supporting groups around.So many, they are starting to put pressure on a party leadership that’s proved almost impervious to everything and everyone .Consider. The traditional model of liberal democracy suggests opposition parties put pressure on governments, and members influence party leaders. But just as the SNP “broke the system” when it won an outright majority in Holyrood – designed to produce minority administrations, coalition and consensus – the party hasproved pretty adept at breaking the unwritten rules of political engagement too.Do the Tories provide effective opposition  Not really – and certainly not any more. With his blunderbuss progress towards a hard Brexit, Boris Johnson has kicked one leg from the leaky vessel containing Scotland’s  Tory MP and MSPs. With one flourish of a signature accepting her new lobbying job, Ruth Davidson has kicked away the other. : Nicola Sturgeon: EU citizens will always be welcome in ScotlandThe Tories can land blows on inidual domestic policy failures – which are rarely as serious as those occurring weekly south of the border – but have failed to offer a coherent, alternative direction for Scotland, or stop Holyrood from being airbrushed out of Brexit proceedings. Scottish Labour is political weakness personied. Every week, Richard Leonard pointlessly weighs in over issues actually reserved to Westminster yet fails to pin the SNP down on the impact of lobbyists, procurement processes which favour a few big consultancy “players”,target-driven strategies that fail to tackle underlying power imbalances and country-sized units of “local” governance.Even though these issues are on the policy agenda of the Scottish Lib Dems and Greens, their rare moments in the spotlight are generally devoted to issues closer to the hearts of core supporters, more topical and easier to deliver in a First Minister’s Question soundbite. Meanwhile, SNP members and even elected representatives have gey little influence on their party leadership. SNP conference is an exercise instage management, but agenda-setting is tightly controlled – as it is in most mainstream parties.But where do new ideas come from  Who is looking over the brow of the constitutional dilemmas ahead and starting to visualise and debate the shape of a new Scotland  Who really influences the SNP – is it the much-feared, unionist-leaning, hypercritical mainstream media  Or might it also be the myriad parts of the Yes movement who refuse to go away, pipe down or be co-opted, refuse to follow the patterns of organisation that bestow “credibility,” and dare to hold conferences – like this weekend’s Radical Independence Conference in Glasgow – to discuss policies and strategies well above their formal pay grade SNP delegates were unable to debate the best strategy to adopta Section  order is rejected. Radical Independence activists spent a full day on that very subject.It’s easy to be cynical about the real import of  lefties debating strategy, but even easier to overlook the start of something big because it doesn’t resemble any part of political business as usual.Common Weal is publishing its own, alternative blueprints for a decentralised, non-market-driven society. Business for Scotland is devising its own persuasive campaign. Radical Independence is debating strategies to keep the pressure up for an official referendum, including an examination of other legal options open to the Scottish Government and the option of tightly-controlled, civil disobedience. Local Yes Groups have formed regional groups – I’d encourage them to consider establishing a National Federation of Yes Groups to ensure the voice of working-class Scotland is heard loud and clear too – and Independence Live is continuing to livestream events that are independence-oriented or simply important to our civic society ignored by mainstream broadcasters. Most of these groups operate without a bean – but all are expanding their numbers, ambition and reach.All Under One Banner too. Some marchers are a bit resentful that it’s taken the First Minister so long to address the wider movement in the time-honoured fashion. Directly. On the streets. But actually, the Yes movement has benefited from the absence of SNP hands on the tiller. A string of marches organised by the SNP would have been dismissed by critics as gatherings of the “party faithful.” Instead, the dogged, well-stewarded marches have become one wing of a distributed Yes movement – a grassroots network like no other, without formal leaders, central offices, membership forms or media coverage.That’s powerful, and in many ways, a collective and unofficial opposition to the Scottish Government – despite the lack of publicity.So, when the cameras and crowds gather to hear Nicola Sturgeon in George Square this weekend, it’ll be no slap in the face to the unacknowledged foot-soldiers of the Yes movement, but the biggest imaginable back-handed compliment.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll scottish independence voters switching to support the union","story":"The Progress Scotland survey found  per cent of voters ldquocompletely support Scotland staying part of the UK, compared with  per cent who ldquocompletely support Scotland becoming independent.Read more: Poll: Nicola Sturgeonrsquos push for election out of step with ScotsThe Survation poll was commissioned by Progress Scotland, headed by former SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson, and surveyed , Scots at the start of the month.It sought answers on a spectrum of - to identy strength of opinion on the issue, with  marking ldquocomplete support for staying in the UK, while  ldquocomplete support for independence.A narrow majoritywere more supportive of the Union, with  per cent in the middle and  per cent more supportive of independence.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry.

Founded on a cross-community basis, the idea was for people to work together where they lived and beyond, focusing on local drama at affordable prices as a ersion from – and a reaction to – rising unemployment and violence.This week, close friend and fellow North Belfast playwright Martin Lynch revealed Kate’s final play, ‘Betrothed’, will be posthumously produced at the Baby Grand, Grand Opera House, on November  and  for three performances only – with two on Saturday, November .Set against the backdrop of the  Irish rebellion, Betrothed tells the tale of one of the most remarkable love stories in Irish history.Whilst the dynamic Emmet was rallying his forces to strike a blow against the English, a remarkable young woman, Sarah Curran, was anxiously waiting his safe . Having secretly agreed to marry once the rebellion was safely out of the way, the young couple’s plans were dashed when Emmet was arrested, tried and hanged, drawn and quartered.Sarah’s story takes a further unexpected turn when she chooses to marry an officer in the British army. Caught between two worlds, can she ever forget the promises of her past Martin Lynch explained: “Kate was the main writer for Tongue ‘n’ Cheek Community Theatre company and wrote many of their plays before she passed away at Christmas before last.“When we worked together at the Community Arts Forum, she would occasionally go on about a woman called Sarah Curran.

Is it a bird  Is it a plane  No, it’s a hawk-shaped kite designed to scare away seagulls and other sky-borne nuisances. Graciously circling overhead like birds of prey on the hunt, two faux hawks are simply attached to a line and pole, which is mounted to the roof of the fast food restaurant, rising and falling with every change in the wind. Passers-by could be forgiven for being startled when the kite is whipped into action by a gentle breeze that helps keep the seagulls at bay . Historically, seagulls have lived near the sea or sometimes beside rivers and reservoirs, but they have increasingly been found in inland towns and cities where they are often viewed as pests by the urban population.The problem is made worse by the fact that the main culprit is the herring gull – one of the largest and most aggressive members of the gull family on the island of Ireland.One reason for the growth in the number of gulls is the relative safety for the birds of perches atop man-made structures, where gulls commonly build their nests out of the reach of predators.Another reasons that gulls have moved inland is the abundant supply of food waste, which helps sustain them. No surprise, then, that they might flock to supermarkets, shops and food outlets like McDonald’s.While retailers, local government authorities, and restaurants have been keen to limit the birds’ access to food waste by using lidded bins and encouraging proper disposal, the urban gull perseveres. The daring and intelligent birds have been known to swoop down on humans to snatch food from their hands – an obvious danger when you’re trying to eat a Big Mac. While the law makes it illegal to recklessly injure or kill any gull or damage or destroy an active nest or its contents, it does, in the interest of health and safety, make allowances for certain control measures, and there are few more clever – or more humane – than the kite hawk. The urban gulls have been the subject of human concern leading, in some cases, to lethal methods of control. However, given that they are a red-list threatened species, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds questions the use of lethal control as a means of dealing with the issue.A less aggressive method of control – like that employed by McDonald’s at Westwoods – is just one solution that may help our co-habitation. At the very least, your McNuggets are somewhat safer."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pipe bomb detonated in west belfast garden","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has condemned a “reckless attack” on a house in West Belfast.A pipe bomb-type device detonated in the front garden of a house at Aitnamona Crescent around .pm on Saturday night.The occupant of the house reported hearing what they believed to be a firework going off.

Since I became First Minister, in December last year, we have an International Relations Minister in our Cabinet – an idea completely unthinkeable at the start of devolution. We have a highly regarded International Strategy, which is being discussed and debated across Wales.”Mr Drakeford stressed the importance of forging links between people on “dferent sides of the Irish Sea”, particularly those from “Celtic nations”.“Amongst us all are links of language, of history, of culture, of economic identity and, in many instances of progressive political outlook,” he said.“We all share the presence of a powerful neighbour, with a global and dominant language and a well-developed sense of its own signicance. In the Brexit context – and beyond it too – we have had the best results, I believe, when we have been able to work together, in an informal Celtic alliance, to provide a more powerful counterweight to hard line leave propositions than we could have mobilised working on our own.“And in the dficult days ahead, I think the effort to identy common interests, to act with a sense of solidarity in their pursuit, and to create outcomes which work for us all – that effort will be needed as never before.”"},{"url":null,"title":"editors viewpoint all credit to tj for turning life around","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Youre in your th anniversary year which you marked by planting bulbs. Tell us about that.A. The girls wanted to leave a legacy so every child from four-year-olds in Prepto my -year-old girls planted a bulb in our anniversary walkway at the front of the school. Beds were dug for every single year group, so in the springtime all of those bulbs will come out. They planted a tree too. We also decided we would have  acts of kindness.Rather than just contribute money, we asked all the girls, by inidual or class, to do an act of kindness. Weve had people out doing beach cleans, weeding gardens and a Christmas lunch for the community.

I dont have a natural catchment in east Belfast. About % of my children come from a three-mile radius but % come from beyond: Ards Peninsula, Bangor, north Belfast, Lisburn.Q. Your policy on bullying A. Zero-tolerance. We educate the girls about their behaviour and relationships and the way they should behave towards each other. Kindness is a word we use a lot at Strathearn.Read MoreMeet the Principal: Robert Robinson, Campbell CollegeMeet the Principal - Karen Quinn, of Victoria CollegeMeet the Principal: Sean Rafferty of St Louis Grammar SchoolRead MoreMeet the principal: Insts Janet WilliamsonQ. How has teaching changed over the years A. Technology is the big change. When I started I was drawing diagrams on the board in chalk. Now everything is at the flick of a switch, weve access to online videos and it has become much more visual. Every room here is equipped with an electronic whiteboard. Children are registered in the morning on computers. Gone is the letter home to parents in the schoolbag now its parentmail. Although social media gets a negative name it can work very positively because we can reach out very directly and quickly to parents. Pupils now are more aware of the world around them, and social media means theyre more exposed to dferent environments.Nicola Connery, principal of Strathearn SchoolQ. Do schools feel a bigger responsibility in the social media world A. Yes. Schools are the best portal for getting the message out, so all schools now have excellent pastoral care systems. We dont try to do it all in-house we bring in external expert agencies to empower the girls to be the best citizens that they can be and look after their personal welfare.Q. What pressures are there on the job nowadays A. Finance is the big one. Every school is having to manage a very tight budget. The other area is special educational needs. With no ing Assembly, its dficult to address either.Q. How aware are the pupils about Stormont A. We have a strong school council here were trying to teach them that debate and discussion is the right way forward for change. Weve just started a politics department, and were bringing in MLAs so the girls can put questions to them. So far the UUPs Mike Nesbitt has been here.Q. So youre offering politics at A-level now A. We always did - in collaboration with other east Belfast schools. Campbell College, Bloomfield Collegiate and Ashfield Girls and Boys have an agreement that we share subjects at A-level.Q. Tell us more about that.A. Campbell doesnt offer media studies I do it here. Campbell or Bloomfield offer German in alternate years so my girls and Bloomfield girls will go to Campbell to make a viable German class. I dont have moving image arts but Ashfield Boys has one of the best.Q. What about the problem in Northern Ireland of educating too many teachers A. Thats a yes and a no. In some areas, maybe. In the secondary sector there are still shortages in some areas such as sciences and business studies.Q. In  you were one of three principalswho teamed up against drugs. There was an e-safety booklet. How well did that initiative work, and have you had to reprimand any pupils for dabbling Nicola Connery, principal of Strathearn SchoolA. Weve never had a drugs problem here. We have excellent girls and an excellent pastoral team who regularly keep them informed on dangers and how to keep themselves safe. We are proactive.Q. Youve taught in co-educational and same-sex schools. Whats the advantage of a girls only school A. The girls dont have any gender bias towards their subject choices. Two of my top subjects are maths and physics. They also stay focused on their studies.Q. An unwelcome advance was made to one of your pupils in Bangor as she was waiting for the bus, and theres been a well-documented incident of a teacher sending inappropriate messages to a pupil at a Belfast grammar school. Do you have special classes to teach the girls about such dangers and threats A. The girls have a weekly Learning for Le and Work tutorial programme with a form tutor and the element that deals with such matters is personal development.Q. In  a pupil, Catherine Buchanan, died from leukaemia. Another, Holly Massey, was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour last year. It cant be easy coping with that A. We are a family at Strathearn and we have a strong sense of community. Last year we raised £, in one week. That showed to me what a special school this is and just how much we care about each other. When something dficult comes we really pull together.Q How important is academic success A. It opens doors and allows the girls to move forward but in this day and age it must be balanced with a skill set.Nicola Connery, principal of Strathearn SchoolThis year our exam results were our best ever. At GCSE .% got  A*s to C, but .% of those grades were A* A - so over  of our grades out of  were A* A. And A-levels were our best ever - .% were  A* to C but % of those were As or A*s.

So is it as straightforward as setting a date and getting on with it  Not quite. Here is a look at how things stand. – What does Boris Johnson want to do now and is he likely to succeed  First, Mr Johnson is making an election bid under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act , requiring a two-thirds Commons majority –  MPs – to have an election on December .MPs will vote on a motion later today to hold an early #generalelection. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, an early election can take placeit is supported by at least two thirds of the @HouseofCommons. Find out more in our briefing https:t.co IPTtwXZk— Commons LibraryOctober , Labour’s lack of support for the proposal means it is likely to be defeated when voted upon on Monday evening.Jeremy Corbyn has insisted that Labour can only support an election once the threat of a no-deal crash-out from the European Union has been completely ruled out.  – Why is there opposition to an election on December   Concerns have been raised about a December election for a number of reasons – not all of them political. There is talk of voters staying away, discouraged by cold wintry evenings, while others could well be booked up with office Christmas parties, nativity plays, shopping and generally busying themselves with festive fun. There are also potential issues with councils being unable to book polling stations and count venues with such short notice. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  – Has December  also been mentioned as a potential date  Yes. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford have put forward a tightly-drafted Bill that would grant an election on December  – three days earlier than the PM’s suggested polling date – as long as the European Union granted the January  extension.The draft law, currently scheduled to be debated in Tuesday’s sitting of the House of Commons, would require a simple majority of  MPs to support it in order to dissolve Parliament –  fewer than under the FTPA “super majority” rules.– What dference does three days make  Ms Swinson said her proposal ties Mr Johnson’s hands over the election date and does not give him the “wriggle room” that his own plan would have.She said it is three further days away from Christmas, adding that keeping the election day as far away from December  is in the best interest of the economy. The Lib Dem leader also pointed out that December  would be a better date for university students who may be leaving university towns tohome for Christmas at the end of term.  times weve put down amendments for a Peoples Vote, including last week  Labour didnt back it.

Ms Swinson said December  is the earliest possible date to have an electionthe Bill is passed, meaning that an election happens “as soon as possible”. Both the Lib Dems and the SNP would hope to benefit from an election before Brexit takes place because they will be hoping to win the backing of people who want Brexit scrapped. The Lib Dems have campaigned for a People’s Vote, while the SNP has also been vocal in its support of a second Brexit referendum. It is confirmed by the EU that we will not be leaving on the st Oct @BorisJohnson has failed to take us off the clf edge, he has been defeated again. Let us have the election @thesnp will do its job and put across our message that those in Scotland should decide our future— Ian BlackfordOctober ,  – So where does Labour stand on all of this  While some around Jeremy Corbyn back a snap election, many Labour MPs are bitterly opposed to a poll, fearing confusion over the party’s position on Brexit will cost them at the ballot box.The party has said it will only back an electionMr Johnson makes “absolutely clear” that no-deal is off the table now that the January extension has been granted.But it is not entirely clear what steps Mr Johnson would have to take to satisfy Labour that no-deal has completely been ruled out. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott suggested further legislation may be required as promises by Mr Johnson were “not worth the paper they’re written on”.She said that Labour would “discuss” the Lib Dems SNP Bill with opposition colleagues.Mr Corbyn had previously said he wanted to wait for the EU’s decision over theof the Article  extension before deciding whether to whip MPs in support of Mr Johnson’s bid for a winter election.– What will the Prime Minister dohe fails in his bid to hold an election on December  A Number  source said on Monday afternoon thatMr Johnson fails, the Government will introduce an “almost identical” Bill to the December  general election proposals put forward by the Lib Dems and SNP. “We need a new Parliament by Christmas so we can Get Brexit Done in January and the country can move on,” the source said.

Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would not agree to anything until it is “clear and concrete exactly what is being proposed” – but that the party would “consider carefully” any legislation which “locks in” the date of an election.It comes amid Liberal Democrat and SNP moves for a poll on December . European Council president Donald Tusk announced on Monday morning that the EU had agreed to accept the UK’s request for a Brexit “flextension” until January . Mr Johnson wrote to Mr Tusk to confirm the UK’s formal agreement to the plan, but said he viewed the “unwanted prolongation” of the UK’s membership as “damaging to our democracy and to the relationship between us and our European friends”. “While we will of course not seek to deliberately disrupt the EU’s business, I must underline that I continue to have a responsibility as Prime Minister to protect the UK’s national interests during this period, including in EU decision-making,” the PM said. “I would have much preferred itthe UK Parliament could have proceeded rapidly to raty the deal we reached between us.“Unfortunately I very much fear that this Parliament will never do so as long as it has the option of further delay. That is why I am seeking a general election in December to ensure the election of a fresh Parliament which is capable of resolving the issue in accordance with our constitutional norms.”"},{"url":null,"title":"england fans join in wonderwall singalong after world cup semifinal win","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

European Council President Donald Tusk has confirmed the move following discussions with the EUs  member states. Ambassadors for the other EU nations approved a draft declaration on the Article  process - the portion of the EU treaty that deals with a countrys application to withdraw from the EU.    EU ambassadors have agreed to accept the UKs request for a Brexit extensionuntil  January, European Council President Donald Tuskhas said. Following discussions over the weekend, the EU  ambassadorsapproved a draft declaration on extending the Article  process. googletag.cmd.push EU member states hadbeen mulling over British Prime Minister Boris Johnsons request for an extension to Article  ever since he grudgingly applied for one via an unsigned letter on  October. While member states had been waiting for clarity on , or when, the UK might provide a clear reason for the extension, such as an election, Mr Johnson hadin turn said he would wait to see what the EU said about the extension before pushing for an election. In a Tweet posted a short time ago, Mr Tusk wrote: The EU has agreed that it will accept the UKs request for a #Brexit flextension until  January . The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure. The UK could still leave the EU earlier than the new deadlinethe House of Commons manages finally to raty the Withdrwal Agreement which has failed at every attempt to date. It also includes potential dates for the Withdrawal Agreement to come into force on  December ,  January  or  February  - which could mean the UKs departure possibly taking place on either  November,  December or  January. However, the UK will be obliged to appoint an EU commissioner in the meantime with a warning from the EU that the extension cannot be used to try to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. Meanwhile, the British Government is set to continue with another attempt to trigger a General Election. A motion calling for an election is expected to be tabled at Westminster later this afternoon with an unlikely two-thirds majority of MPs required for it to succeed. The desired election date for the government is December  meaning that the British Parliament would need to dissolve by November . But, a bill resulting from an alliance between the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party is seeking to amend the  Fixed Parliament Act to include December  as the date for a general election. This now comes into play as the EUs agreement to a Brexit extension cuts off on January . This also means that simple majority in the House of Commons would suffice to see it through and not a two-thirds majority of MPs. The amendment would also kill any immediate prospect of a no deal Brexit. However, with the SNP and Liberal Democrat presence in the House of Commons amounting to a total of  seats, the success of that bill will need heavy cross-party backing.

Therefore, John decided that any money raised would go to the same charity.Between both the coffee morning and John’s sponsored silence over pound, was raised and a few late donations have been filtering in.Speaking to the Derry News at the weekend John said of the challenge: “I didn’t speak until I came out of the school at  o’clock. It was tough enough. My wee girls were saying, ‘try not to break it’, but it was hard because I’m used to rambling on.“The principal was taunting away at me, saying ‘John, ye haven’t seen the caretaker ’ and I would shake my head, then he’d go, ‘do ye know where he is ’ and I would just shake my head again.“And someone of the kids, the primary  pupils, would say ‘gone speak to me’, so they were doing a bit of taunting too. But they couldn’t break me.”John has his sights set on another charity fundraiser after Christmas when he plans on walking from Derry to Buncrana and back again - he says Macmillan will most likely be the beneficiary again.Sadly, a number of John’s close family have had cancer and he appreciates the emotional, physical and financial support the charity offers.“They’re known as the ‘little angels’ and they do a great job. If you have somebody belonging to you suffering with cancer then they put them at ease.“The work they do is amazing,you ever have any issues you’re able to phone them and they come straight away.“I’m happy to see this money go to them because it will go towards helping more families in Derry.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Department of Education has however told this paper that a petition signed by parents and pupils at the school will be taken into account by the Permanent Secretary. Parents were “devastated’ when first informed of proposals to close the Coshquin school after a letter was sent out asking them to attend a meeting with Education Authority officials back in April. Parents and schoolchildren from Groarty P.S. then hand delivered letters to education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry imploring him to reconsider. googletag.cmd.push Due to uncertainty surrounding the future of the school, a number of parents have taken the dficult decision to transfer their children to another school. One such parent, Diana McLaughlin, whose son and daughter attended the school, said: We actually ended up leaving the school. The uncertainty was a bit too much for us. I didnt need the hardship of worrying about finding an appropriate school later so I moved my son to St.Patricks where we have other children in the family there. Her son, Haiden, misses Groarty IPS terribly and found the transition to a new school very dficult but is now settling in well. Mrs McLaughlin added: With transfer tests looming, we really wanted to get them settled before all that work kicked off.

The EA argues that the school’s enrolment falls “well short” of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school. And says in addition there are more than two year groups within a classroom as the school operates as a three teacher school. The EA has a duty to encourage, facilitate and promote shared education.

The -year old is now a free agent after the playing season ended and is considering his options, although it is still possible he could stay at the Brandywell having already had discussions on a new contract with Declan Devine.Yet with Perth also a big fan of Sloggett, it seems likely that the midfielder will have no shortage of options before he commits to playing next year.Sloggett, like his manager and team mates, was in celebratory mood after Derry City defeated Finn Harps - on Friday night to seal European football next season , an achievement which Devine described as his greatest of his managerial career.We were selling a pipedream to players in December,” he stated. “The place didnt have the most positive feel about it when we came in last November because of the season last year.“Weve been magnicent. We went to very dficult venues and performed and to see the Brandywell full again, thats definitely my biggest achievement. Lets see where we go in the future but this is a night Ill not forget for a long time. googletag.cmd.push  Change for the betterThe feeling at the Brandywell on Friday night was in stark contrast to the mood around the club at this stage just twelve months ago, after an eighth place finish in the Premier Division. So much has changed in such a short time. I didnt really think about achieving Europe to be honest, Devine continued. I wanted us to get a good start and see where we were. I wanted a team that reflects the passion of the football club and honesty and work ethic of the football club.I watched last year and teams were coming from Dublin and Cork and they were walking in here and walking back out with three points and I didnt like that. Our guys fight for the club, fight for the city and fight for their families. “Add into that theyre not only fighting but putting on a brilliant display of attacking football, scoring a lot of goals and creating a lot of chances. “The players deserve huge credit and Im just over the moon for them.It has undoubtedly been a successful season for Devine, his staff and his players, but the City boss is not content, and wants even further progress next season. We finished fourth but we want to push on and get better next year,” he insisted.It takes a lot of effort but Im very fortunate that I have Kevinand Paddyand Martyand Declan McIntrye and all the backroom team pulling in the one direction. Those guys have put their le and soul into it.Theres a lot of good people at this football club. We all share a work ethic and we all work extremely hard.Coming off the pitch there was supporters there who were eight, nine,  years of age. There were supporters who were in their s.Its a fantastic night for us but we have to strive to get better and not pat ourselves on the back too much. “Its going to be harder next year and Im sure a lot of clubs will put a lot of investment into it.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Final touches are now being added to the packed programme of events lined up for the coming days, featuring an extravaganza of family friendly activities to suit all ages. When the final firework illuminates the Foyle and brings to a close the traditional ghoulish goings on, tranquillity s with a magical and meditative experience marking the AllHallowtide celebration First Light. Taking place on Friday November st and Saturday November nd, First Light will bring people of all faiths together in the spirit of remembrance and reflection to mark the all Saints and All Souls Feast Days. A series of services, installations, musical and choral experiences will run throughout the two days aimed at offering opportunities to reflect, offer prayers and thanks. googletag.cmd.push Events coordinator with Derry City and Strabane District Council, Helena Hasson, said that after such a busy week for the city it would be an opportunity to slow the pace and remember the spiritual origins of the All Hallows celebration. “First Light is a relatively new element to our Halloween programme and one that we continue to grow and develop in partnership with the local churches and community organisations. It’s very unique and quite special. “After being caught up in the excitement and energy of Halloween, First Light immerses us once again in calmness and serenity. It really is a beautul programme of thought provoking events aimed at bringing people together and engaging them in restorative and enlightening activities.” Leave behind the noise and indulgence of the night before with some Blissology by the Light of the Moon in the Guildhall, withmeditative yoga sessions taking place throughout Friday. The sessions are free and are open to everyone, no experience required. The Guildhall Main Hall will remain open from .am – .pm for anyone who wants to come and spend some time under Luke Jerram’s ethereal Museum of the Moon installation. Candle bags will be available for visitors to write a message of remembrance for a loved one, which will then be placed on the Main Hall stage. The Guildhall Square main stage will host a musical showcase to remember as choirs from across the city display their talents on Friday afternoon at the Voices of Light event. If you’re seeking some spiritual fulfilment then the Windows to the Soul Reflective Walking Tour will take you on a contemplative journey around some of the city’s most signicant places of reflection and worship on Friday and Saturday. Beginning at Aras Colmcille, the tour will take in St Columba’s Long Tower, before moving to St Augustine’s, then First Derry Presbyterian Church, and finishing at St Columb’s Cathedral. Organizer Kieran Grfiths explained the idea behind the tour. “It was inspired from a poem by local poet Daniel Ferguson. His poem talks about each religion as a window looking at Christ, and each window has a dferent architecture, but is looking at the same Christ. “Volunteers and Church leaders from each venue were interviewed during the project as to how they pray, what is special about their place and what they would want a visitor to know about the Church. From this process a tour outlining the atmosphere, history, people, song and prayer of each place has been written. The tour will give a look into the soul of that church. “The process of interviewing and writing this simple walking tour was a very moving experience. It moved the inertia of routine, it moved perceptions of others and it was emotionally moving on many occasions meeting the wonderfully dedicated human beings keeping these beautul building and the message alive.” Enjoy specially composed music and share a common prayer at each of the churches as part of this reverent look into the presentation of faith marking the feast of All Saints and All Souls. Candle bags will again be available at each of the churches so that people can write an intention for a loved one they have lost and place the lit lantern bag at that church. This event is free and everyone is welcome. The First Light programme will conclude with a peaceful choral performance at Eugene’s Cathedral, as people gather to remember departed family and friends at pm, followed by a special mass of remembrance awww.derryhalloween stlightt .pm. Intentions can be offered up during the mass and the cathedral will be bathed in golden light to commemorate All Souls and First Light.

This is a legal requirement for all dogs and puppies once they are  weeks old and failure to do so is an offence under the Animal Health  Welfare Act  . Dog owners need to be in possession of a microchipping certicate also so it is important your contact details are kept up-to-date. It is the pet owner’s responsibility to inform the database operator of any change of contact details so once your dog has been microchipped, check the database to ensure your details are correct. googletag.cmd.push If your pet becomes lost, having them microchipped is the best way to ensure they will be reunited with you as it’s the first thing a veterinary practice, rescue centre or dog warden do is to scan your pet for a microchip. Lost animals puts a lot of extra pressure on animal rescue centres, dog pounds and veterinary practices but it also causes more upset for pets and their owners so don’t delay and get your dog microchipped today – it’s the law!. While microchipping is recommended for all cat owners as well as dogs, there are no current plans to make microchipping compulsory for cats. Help your pets during Halloween Pet owners can help train their dogs and cats to become accustomed to the sounds of Halloween fireworks by playing similar sounds at low volumes. As dficult as it may be, try not to react to your pet showing signs of fear as it may be the best way you can help them. Licking objects such as toys filled with treats may help ease your pet’s stress. If they are up for it, playing with them may also be a welcome distraction, but don’t force ityour pet is too upset to play. Walk your dog in the morning and earlier evening away from any fireworks. If you are concerned that your pet is unmanageably terried of the noise of fireworks, you should consult your vet to discuss ways for managing your pet’s stress. Outdoor pets including small mammals or birds should also be brought indoors into a secure garage or shed where they can be secure from any loud noise or fireworks. You can also cover hutches or cages with blankets to act as sound-proofing. Horses, ponies and donkeys should also be microchipped, and those that live in areas with a considerable amount of Halloween-related noise should be securely stabled to prevent them from escaping or hurting themselves. Keep sweets and decorations out of reach Dogs and cats should be kept away from sweets and Halloween decorations. Chocolate and raisins are highly toxic to pets, as are any sweets containing the sugar substitute xylitol. Ingesting foil or plastic wrappers can also lead to digestive problems and may require surgery. If your pet does ingest something toxic, contact your vet immediately. Beware of costumes Not all pets will tolerate wearing costumes and it may cause them undue stress. Only dress up your pet for Halloweenyou know they enjoy it. Halloween themed bandanas can be less restrictive soyou do choose to put your pet in a costume, make sure it does not limit the animal’s movement, vision, ability to breathe or behave normally. Also ensure any costume doesn’t have any small, chewable pieces or toxic paints or dyes. People wearing Halloween costumes can be equally as scary to pets. Masks or other costume accessories may trigger their territorial instincts. While people might enjoy being spooked during the Halloween festivities, it’s not fun for pets. If your pet is scared, ensure they are in a separate room and safe place. Look out for wildle Hedgehogs go into hibernation this time of year and will sleep in woodpiles or heavy scrub and leaves. It is important you check under all woodpiles before lighting any bonfires to ensure there is no wildle hibernating. Some outdoor decorations such a fake spider webs or string lights can snare wild animals, so be careful about hanging them and remove them after the festivities. Report animal cruelty Unfortunately, stray animals can fall victim to abuse or cruel Halloween pranks. If you witness animal cruelty, contact your local Garda station immediately and the ISPCA National Animal Cruelty Helpline on  orreport online. ISPCA Public Relations Manager Carmel Murray said:“While we all enjoy the festivities of Halloween, many pets and wildle will find this time of year terrying. It is important that they have a secure place to hide indoorsthey are frightened by the noises of fireworks and trick-or-treaters calling to the door. Leaving the lights low, and playing the radio or television can help drown out some of the sounds as it can be a stressful time for them. It is also important our pets are kept safe in a secure room where they cannot dart out an open door. If your pet manages to escape, it is important they are wearing an ID tag plus they should be microchipped, which is a legal requirement for all dogs and puppies once they are  weeks old. Pets that have been found will be scanned for a microchip which holds the pet owners contact details so it is important this information is kept up to date. Carmel added: Halloween can also be a dangerous time for our wildle so it is important to check under wood, scrub and leaves for hibernating hedgehogs before lighting any bonfires.

It must also take into account “funding and planning” considerations before any Foyle Street build can take place.It comes after it was revealed that City Deal funding will not be released for at least another year with project builds expected to commence a number of years down the line.Ulster University’s preferred site for the development of its Medical School and associated innovation facilities is along the Riverfront.It is envisaged that the site adjacent to the Council on the Strand Road will be part of that development with the potential to also include the Council Civic Offices building.A Derry City  Strabane District Council spokesperson said that should this development come to fruition, then the Council’s preferred relocation would be to a site adjacent to the Guildhall “at Foyle Street car park”. “These proposals are dependent on a number of factors, including funding and are all at an early stage of development with no decision having yet been made.”Council has advised that, “subject to affordability and commitment”, the contribution from Council to the Government’s City Deal Future Fund investment relates to “the relocation and development of civic commercial offices at Foyle Street to facilitate the objectives of the riverfront development of Ulster University.” If this is approved, money will be allocated to the continued regeneration of Derry’s city centre and the leisure element of the integrated Strabane Town Centre regeneration project.The combined value of these projects is estimated to be in the region of pound-m and will be dependent on “affordability and the economic and regeneration leverage benefits of such an investment as a catalyst for the advancement and development of the other projects,” a Council spokesperson concluded. googletag.cmd.push Talent drain Ulster University will receive poundm of the pound committed by the UK Government through its City Deal and Inclusive Future Funds. Official Council documents suggest it may be given additional fundsit’s included as part of the poundm set aside for Queen’s Quay Riverfront projects.UU’s poundm will be invested in centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automation , the Graduate Entry Medical Schooland Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .When match funding is added from the NI government, Council, private investors and possibly the Irish government, the total is anticipated to be around poundm.The Derry University Group which is lobbying for an independent university in the North West said Council needs as an “urgent priority” to reopen the City Deal to allow the inclusion of new third-level education providers. “It must also establish a Higher Education Development and Scrutiny committee entirely independent of UU.“The North West handing over poundm-plus of its City Deal to an institution that has neglected it and bled it dry is nothing less than Stockholm Syndrome. “Council is putting the entire future in this region in an organisation whose main purpose has been to drain talent and money out of this region and east of the Bann.“Derry has been waiting for Phase  Magee expansion since Belfast civil servants first refused it in . We cannot wait another  years, or even  months.“If they are unable to deliver immediately they must move aside and allow another institution to deliver.”UU said the proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of its first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus. “A continued collaborative approach between all partners is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the outline business cases.”Asked about plans for the former Foyle College lands, which were acquired by UU at the beginning of this year, the university said it is exploring options in line with its “wider estates strategy and our plans for growth of the Magee campus.”The Derry News also questioned the Norther Ireland Officeabout a timeline for City Deal funding and whether the NI government is likely to provide match funding.A spokesperson refused to comment on match funding, and simply said: The Derry  Strabane City Deal is progressing well. The UK Government continues to assist the Council as with all City and Growth Deal partners, to advance progress as quickly as possible, whilst ensuring that each proposed project has a robust business case. “We are currently working with NI Departments and the Council to deliver this at the earliest opportunity.

The Go For It programme provides advice and support to anyone wishing to start their own business, by taking them through the process of creating a business plan. Gerard McElwee at McElwee Custom Motorcycles is one local business to have completed the Programme with Derry City and Strabane District Council after leaving full time employment to turn his lelong passion for motorcycles into a career.Celebrating the success of the Go For It Programme in the Council area, the Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said: “The Go For It Programme continues to be a fantastic success in the area. “ I am delighted that so many entrepreneurs have established the business of their dreams with the incredible support and expert advice on offer at Enterprise North West and Strabane Enterprise Agency.“Council have steered  local entrepreneurs like Gerard from McElwee Custom Motorcycles through the business start-up process, helping them to turn their ideas into a reality. “Budding entrepreneurs can avail of expert advice to develop a comprehensive business plan, covering everything from accounts to marketing and long-term business growth.“New business start-ups, like McElwee Custom Motorcycles play a vital role in our local economy and as such, continue to be a priority for the Council. “I would encourage anyone who has a business idea to get in touch and utilise the expert advice that the Go For It Programme offers.”Strabane-based McElwee Custom Motorcycles is a specialist motorcycle workshop that focuses on custom builds and classic motorcycle restorations whilst also offering a full range of regular services including engine repairs, tyre fitting, maintenance and diagnostics. A specialist motorcycle mechanic by trade, Gerard McElwee has spent years mastering his trade, building his skillset with the goal of opening his own workshop in his home town. Gerard said: “Since I can remember I have always been fascinated with bikes, I got my first bike when I was  and started tinkering and learning from then. “Looking back it was clear that any future career would involve motorcycles, it is my true passion.“I worked in England, for Norton Motorcycles and it was there I developed my craft but I always knew I wanted to come home and open my own workshop. “I had the contacts within the local biking community, but lacked the business know- how to get the business off the ground. “The Go For it Programme was fantastic, they helped me turn my passion for restoring motorcycles into a robust and viable business. “Their guidance was really practical and they helped me to really reinforce my business idea into something which wasn’t available in the local area. “My business advisor at Strabane Enterprise Agency helped me to put together a business plan which outlined a clear growth strategy including financial forecasts, sales targets and marketing plans as well as insurance and legislative details. Since completing the Go For It Programme, Gerard has also availed of further support through the council’s Business Boost Programme, which aims to provide specialist support to small businesses within the Council area to grow their business. “Through Business Boost I was able to put my Go For It business plan into action to help strengthen and grow my business. “I held an evening for local motorcyclists in my workshop, showcasing what I could offer, making sure thatever they needed a repair, I would be the first to spring to mind. It proved really successful, and from then my workshop has been full.”“The Go For It Programme has opened many doors for me, including Derry City and Strabane District Councils pound, Business Start Up Challenge, where I was a runner up and was awarded pound,. “I was also named North West Business Person of the Year at the recent North West Business Awards. “These opportunities would have passed me byit hadn’t been for the Go For It Programme.”If you have a business idea you’d like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It Programme on    or visit: www.goforitni. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sean Bell started the ball rolling for the Downpatrick side with a great opening point. However, Bryansfordrsquos sharpshooter Danny Savage, who was to score a spectacular - for his side, levelled the scoring.The RGU then played some scintillating football to take a - to - lead with points from Gerdy Collins , Connor McCarron and Johnnie Bell, who was having a superb game at midfield.Damian Turley, Collins and Tom Smyth were dominating the game and it was dficult to see how Bryansford were going to compete with them.But Savage, a former Down player, kept the lsquoFord in touch with four unanswered points to bring his side within one of the visitors.Another former county player, Packie Downey, was coming more into the game and he levelled the scores with a stunning point from play.Downpatrickrsquos Conor McGrady, another to wear the famous red and black colours, was brought into the game when defender Damian Branf was black carded, putting the RGU in front with a point.Smyth put the Hoops two in front, but the RGU were left stunned when Chris Clarke ended the half with an explosive shot that beat Deeny in the RGU goal to give Bryansford the half-time lead.If the RGU was stunned going into the break, after dominating for long periods in the first half, then after the opening  minutes of the second period, the thought of relegation to Division  was beginning to look a real possibility.Savage scored with with two frees, a  and a rsquo, but then the lsquoFord sharpshooter, with a real opportunist goal, put his side unbelievably six in front.Tim Prenter was then introduced into the game in place of McCarron and with the RGU management urging their players on, they duly responded with points from Branaganand a brace from Conor Doherty to put only one in the game.Conail McNabb was brought on in place of Ruari Quinn and unfortunately only lasted five minutes with a hamstring injury to be replaced by Tommy Loudon.However, with time ticking away, Savage again was the thorn in the RGU side with a  yard free to extend the lead to two.Damian Turley, with a breathtaking score, put the Hoops tantalising only one behind, but Davy McKibben, with a  yard free, put the lsquoFord two ahead again.Try as they could, the Hoops could not mount one last challenge and they were doomed to Division  for next year.Bryansford: M Reid, J Harbinson, S Toner, A Ward, D McDonald, T McAreavey, N OrsquoHiggins, P Downey , D McKibben , C Maginn, K Kavanagh, T Hanna, R OrsquoHiggins, C Clark , D Savage .Downpatrick: J Deeny, P Smyth, D Branf, E Rooney, R Murphy, S Bell , T Smyth , J Bell , D Turley , C McCarron , G Collins , C Doherty , J Branagan , P Turley, R Quinn.

She insists that she intends to deliver the authentic voice of moderate, progressive Irish nationalism in a place where it needs to be heard.And she has vowed to be a hard working Peer, lobbying and building alliances with other peers and parties across the chamber that will bring benefit to people in Northern Ireland.And while the former MP regrets no longer being a member of the SDLP, she said her political views have not altered and will reflect the partyrsquos central social democratic messages focused on the needs of people and the principles of equality, fairness and social justice for all in the House of Lords.With her new title now confirmed, Baroness Ritchie described Downpatrick as a ldquohistoric place on the island of Ireland, where St Patrick began and ended his ministry.ldquoThe town is a place of immense heritage and has a longstanding history. It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South. Sadly these have been down for nearly three years, she said.The Baroness added: ldquoMy appointment to the House of Lords is an evolution. I was elected to Down Council in , was the organisationrsquos first female chairman, worked as MP Eddie McGradyrsquos parliamentary secretary, became an MLA and MP for South Down and a Minister in the Stormont administration.ldquoIt is now the House of Lords which represents a new challenge and an opportunity which I fully intend to grasp and embrace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Bid.jpg","title":"Bid for community centre in Crossgar  ","story":"A CALL has been made for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to keep the pressure on the Department for Communities to fund a new community centre in Crossgar.The village will be left without a building used to host a number community events when the Downpatrick Street property is sold.

The three of them were regularly checking the weather in the last few weeks leading up to race day as the temperatures were well up in the high s.Far too hot to be running a marathon, but thankfully in the final week it took a dramaticdown to nine degrees. Flying over on Friday with no time to waste, it was straight to the hotel and then immediately to the Expo to pick up their race numbers and buy some of the many race souvenirs that were on sale.In the Expo there was a wall of fame for all the runners who had completed the six majors. Murlough ACrsquos very own Paula McKibbin and Ann McAlarneyrsquos names were spotted on the wall for all to see.There was no time to get over the six-hours jet lag as they were all up at five in the morning and headed downtown to the start of the km friendship run.This was a bit of fun and involved a quick lap of the city centre finishing in Grant park. The rest of the day was spent in true MAC style with a boat cruise along the Chicago river before dinner in an Italian restaurant.The evening got better as needing a taxi for six people to take them back to the hotel, they managed to acquire the use of a party limousine at a very good rate.Another early start on Sunday as the marathon began at .am in the neighbouring Grant Park. Thankfully, it was only a  minute walk from the hotel. Theyrsquod only just made it into the corrals and the race started.A field of , runners, heading off north through the city, with defending champion Mo Farah expected to retain his title.As the route wound through the city it passed through many dferent districts, all with a party atmosphere and lined with people cheering and screaming encouragement.The noise during a major marathon in the USA is beyond belief, the bands playing, spectators lsquohigh fivingrsquo and the streets lined with people three or four thick is an experience like no other. We passed through the Mexican Quarter with bands playing and guys dancing, wearing sombreros and then on to Chinatownrsquo with the streets lined with drummers.It was then onto the Gay Quarter with drag queens performing on stage. It was a celebration for both runners and spectators.As with all marathons, the last five miles were a real test of mental determination as fatigue kicked in and Carol, unfortunately, was suffering from a knee injury that she picked up during training which ed at mile .They all pushed on with Hugh crossing the line first and recording a new personal best by one and a half minutes. Orla was next home followed by Charisse who recorded a huge personal best of  minutes.Carol was next home and managed to finish in a respectable time as she battled through the final  miles with knee problems. As the runners walked down the street after finishing they were greeted by four lines of local school kids applauding and congratulating all the runners. After the kids there were long tables either side of the street where one of the local sponsors, which happened to be a brewery, handing out free beer. Then onto the next table where they were given food and water.It makes you wonder what is not to like about this marathon  In the ladiesrsquo race a new world record was set as Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radclfersquos record of  years. Ironically, as Carol finished her race and walked down to collect her medal she was presented with it from no other than Paula herself.It was back to the hotel to get ready for dinner that evening. As Hugh and Charisse walked back they talked about getting a pint of milk each for recovery.As the shop was a ten-minute walk away, Charisse said that even though she knew it would be a bit more expensive she was happy to buy milk for them both in the hotel bar.Being content with the two half pints that the bar served it was only when the bill was produced that they both discovered that they must have drunk the most expensive two glasses of milk ever, with a bill of  dollars. Anything to save tired feet.That evening they continued in MAC style, celebrating with a meal on Cindyrsquos roof top restaurant followed by a few beers in Buddy Guyrsquos Blues bar where we were treated in style with a table in the VIP area.

This was Kieranrsquos first big run in over three months due to injuries, so took him a lot longer to finish, but he says it just meant he had more time to take in the lovely views of Melbourne.It was an amazing race from start to finish taking in all the iconic places around Melbourne such as St Paulrsquos Cathedral, Flinders Street, Botanic Gardens and the Shrine of Remembrance.Followed by a lap around the GP circuit then up and down St Kildarsquos beach along the promenade.

But this reprieve was short-lived as the same man got in behind again, but this time finishing well to bring the scores level.Both teams had openings, where a better pass or better cross could have led to a winner, but the game went to extra-time at -.The heavy ground seemed to have taken its toll on both teams as an uneventful  minutes meant the game went to penalties.The hosts scored their first three spot kicks and Saintfield missed their second and third.The Saints scored their fourth and Harper made a save to give the visitors some hope, but the Saints hit the bar with their final penalty to go out of the cup at the first hurdle.Seagoe FC Saintfield United INTERMEDIATE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Saul.jpg","title":"Saul pre school praised in inspection report  ","story":"SAUL community pre-school playgroup is celebrating after receiving an encouraging inspection report from the Education and Training Inspectorate.The St Patrickrsquos Road playgroup received the second highest rating of good for quality of learning provision, leadership and management and outcomes for children.Playgroup leader, Delia McLaughlin, took over in September last year only to learn that the school was to have an inspection at the end of her first six months.She explained that staff joined with her working tirelessly over the months, often staying late at night to prepare for the inspection.ldquoWe also had support from our Early Years advisor Megan McConaghy and management committee,Delia explained. ldquoWe are all delighted to have received the second highest rating and are committed to maintaining this standard of the years to come.Accredited by Early Years, the Organisation for Young Children, the playgroup aims to provide quality pre-school care to children aged from two years and  months to four years.Mrs McLoughlin leads a team of play assistants mdash Rita Magorrian, Maureen Fitzsimons, Pauline Carlin and volunteer Niamh Kearney mdash to look after the  children who attend the morning an afternoon sessions.The inspectors noted that the playgrouprsquos provision for The World Around Us and early mathematical experiences were ldquoparticular strengths.The report also noted: ldquoThe quality of interactions between staff and the children is very good.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives. Whatever that may be, it is important that we as students embrace it and make the most of it, he added.Will Greenaway closed the conference by reiterating the potential benefits that could come from Brexit and potential concerns that leaving the EU could have on us in Northern Ireland and especially in Fermanagh.ldquoOur generation of students represent the future of Northern Ireland we are potentially the next generation of business leaders, health care workers and entrepreneurs.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

After three years supporting a ravaged Conservative government, the DUP were thrown to the EU wolves . Boris Johnson in the House of Commons on Saturday in the debate on his Brexit plan. He slapped down the concerns of Mr Dodds, and even expressed regret that anyone would seek to use a vetoNext time they invite a Tory conference speaker they should insist on him taking a lie detector test .The wilful ruthless and vicious resolve of Boris Johnson to devalue the Union was clear.

Letter to the editorAs Ben Lowry asserted in his column ‘Middle England chose Brexit over NI fully in UK,’ October , Boris Johnson’s loyalty is first and foremost to the Conservative party and its English electorate. It was always going to be the case and therein lies the harsh lesson for unionism to learn . It is imperative that unionists consolidate and ensure that maintaining the Union remains in our own hands. That is the battle line drawn for the next election when unionists bite the bullet andthe maximum number of MPs possible to hold firm for the unionist cause .We have been here before with shyster prime ministers and survived. This time we now know in advance where we all stand in terms of having our unionism undermined. What unionism requires are cool heads, sharp minds and positive leadership as never before . Solidarity tied into a unity of defence and purpose in upholding the integrity of the Union and reasserting our right to self determination is the number one unionist priority.David McNarry, Comber©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  -- -- People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      WATCH: Mother pleads with missing son Noel McGrogan to come home to his  beautul childrenAn impassioned plea has been made by a desperate mother who wants her -year-old son tohome.

Some party members believed that the UUP leader will be forced into a climbdown which would be humiliating, given that he has not yet formally succeeded Robin Swann as leader and will not do so until next Saturday.Other DUP members believed that their party was now so strong that it did not need the UUP and so his decision was irrelevant.Speaking to the News Letter ahead of the DUP conference, Mr Aiken was scathing about the UUP’s far larger unionist rival, particularly in relation to its record at Stormont and the mess of the Brexit negotiations.He made clear that he sees the UUP dferentiating itself from the DUP under his leadership.\"  \"  EU grant Boris Johnson three month Brexit extensionAbuse victims could get £, upfront payment Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The UUP and DUP have had an electoral pact for the last two Westminster elections.The DUP is most vulnerable in North Belfast.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says.

When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference.

I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis.

One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business.
