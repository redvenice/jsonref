Among the tweets were ones that pictured Jarrett next to a character from Planet of the Apes, and a doctored image of Whoopie Goldberg wearing a t-shirt that shows Trump shooting himself in the head      Despite apologizing for her previous comments about George Soros and Valerie Jarrett, Barr retweeted a stream of content that backed her remarks while wading into other right-wing causes and conspiracies      Barr also said she thought former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett was white when she penned the racist tweet that got her show pulled from television          Barr said she though Jarrett \u0027was Jewish and Persian\u0027 amid a bizarre flurry tweets penned late on Tuesday night          Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran but both of her parents are African American, and her great-grandfather was the first credited African American architect. She appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday (pictured) to lay blame for Barr\u0027s rhetoric at the feet of President Trump, saying: \u0027The tone comes from the top\u0027          The shamed star also blamed her racist rant on sleeping pill Ambien. Users have previously reported going into blackouts and performing complex actions such as driving and making food without recalling it           Roseanne\u0027s show was the most viewed program on ABC before it was cancelled over a tweet in which she said Jarrett was the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027          Actor John Goodman, 65, stepped out to walk his dog in New Orleans on Tuesday soon after news broke that his show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 had been canceled because of his castmate Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets          She then went on to rant about what she described as a Soros plot to overthrow America \u0027by buyingbacking candidates 4 local district attorney races who will ignore US law \u0026amp favor \u0027feelings\u0027 instead-and call everyone who is alarmed by that \u0027racist\u0027.\u0027Following on from that, she called on Americans to unite against his narrative while throwing a reference to MK Ultra, a discontinued CIA program that right-wing conspiracy theorists believe is still ongoing, into the mix           It was during this rant that Barr made the comment \u0027muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a babyvj\u0027, using Valerie Jarrett\u0027s initials, that would see her show axed.Barr subsequently deleted the tweet but not before it had been copied and shared across social media, leading to swift calls for her show to be pulled from the air.          After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.           Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.       Soon after the news broke, Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the TV show, was spotted looking very glum as he walked his dog          Goodman, 65, is yet to offer any comment on Barr\u0027s tweets or their show being axed          Gilbert, who played Darlene Conner on the series, had earlier slammed Barr\u0027s tweets as \u0027abhorrent\u0027  Barr also lashed out at former costar Sara Gilbert for her reaction to the racism row, in which Gilbert called her comments \u0027abhorrent\u0027 and \u0027disappointing\u0027, by saying \u0027wow! unreal\u0027  Bar clapped back at Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, accusing him of throwing her under a bus      Barr was widely condemned after she tweeted that Jarrett looked like \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby\u0027.Jarrett responded to the ordeal when she spoke at a town hall on MSNBC called \u0027Everyday Racism in America\u0027 later on Tuesday. She revealed that Disney CEO Bob Iger had called her to apologize.\u0027He wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling the show,\u0027 she said. \u0027First of all, I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment. I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m worried about all the people out there who don\u0027t have a circle of friends and followers coming to their defense. \u0027The person walking down the street minding their own business and they see someone clinging to their purse or walk across the street... or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation, the talk as we call it.\u0027Those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day.\u0027     ABC has decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          \u0027We have decided to cancel her show,\u0027 Channing Dungey, President of ABC Entertainment, announced on Tuesday afternoon           Disney CEO Bob Iger  tweeted about ABC\u0027s decision, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027 Disney owns ABC Television Group   Barr came under fire for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett during an unhinged rant on Tuesday morning          Many on Twitter were appalled by Barr\u0027s tweet, which was in response to an article from a conspiracy website The Disney CEO also tweeted about the decision to terminate the show, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027Shortly after Barr\u0027s show was cancelled, talent agency ICM Partners revealed they were dropping her as a client. \u0027We are all greatly distressed by the disgraceful and unacceptable tweet from Roseanne Barr this morning,\u0027 ICM said in an internal note to employees that was obtained by the Hollywood Reporter. \u0027What she wrote is antithetical to our core values, both as iniduals and as an agency.\u0027 \u0027Consequently, we have notified her that we will not represent her. Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign. Other networks including Viacom also dropped reruns of the original Roseanne as the industry turned its back on the show and its star performer. The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.   Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable,\u0027 the 18-year-old wrote. \u0027As I called my manager to quit working on Roseanne, I was told it was cancelled. I feel so empowered by @iamwandasykes , Channing Dungey and anyone at ABC standing up for morals and abuse of power. Bullies will NEVER win.\u0027Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the show.   \u0027Ton of respect for Bob Iger. Tough decision with financial consequences for his company but right for America,\u0027 he wrote. Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, said he was \u0027devastated\u0027. \u0027Today is one of the hardest days of my life. I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience that welcomed us into their home,\u0027 he wrote on Twitter. Comedian Wanda Sykes had earlier revealed she would not return to the show following the comedian\u0027s racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett (Pictured L-R: Sykes, Russell Peters, Barr, JB Smoove, Keenen Ivory Wayans in 2014)          Sykes, a consulting producer for Barr\u0027s eponymous show on ABC, revealed the news on Twitter          Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled           Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the showFishman said he condemned Roseanne\u0027s statement \u0027vehemently\u0027, saying they were \u0027reprehensible and intolerable\u0027 and \u0027truly offensive\u0027.  \u0027My character was designed to represent the inclusive nature of my views. To represent potions of society often marginalized,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.    Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027  \u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mobEDL founder Tommy Robinson arrested by police outside courtYoung boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hug\u0027I\u0027m not buying her book\u0027: Emily Hunt on Greer\u0027s rape commentsMichael Rotondo talks his mental health and losing his sonWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlMan headbutts thug who is beating his ex-wife in Turkish streetShocking moment cyclist pulls knife on driver in fit of road rageTrump threatens to push German luxury cars out of the USShocking moment fight breaks out between two bus passengersPolice officers attend stabbing crime scene in Chelsea, London    A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne. I told you. So,\u0027 author Roxane Gay added, to which Julianne Moore replied: \u0027Yes you did. #FireRoseanne.\u0027 Reverend Al Sharpton also criticized the comedian and called on ABC to \u0027take action now\u0027. \u0027The comparison by Rosanne Barr on ABC of Former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett to an APE is racist and inexcusable,\u0027 he tweeted. Tomi Lahren was a rare prominent conservative voice to hit out at Roseanne. \u0027What Roseanne said was wrong,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027I\u0027m sure she knows that. She made a mistake.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know why fellow conservatives are playing mental gymnastics trying to justify it. Come on. Wrong is wrong.\u0027 Only Rosie O\u0027Donnell appeared to lend some support to Roseanne, writing that she loved her \u0027quite a bit\u0027. \u0027The comment Roseanne tweeted was racist and childish and beneath her best self,\u0027 O\u0027Donnell wrote. \u0027She has apologized. Twitter is a dangerous place.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not buying her book\u0027: Emily Hunt on Greer\u0027s rape commentsYoung boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hugShocking moment cyclist pulls knife on driver in fit of road rageMichael Rotondo talks his mental health and losing his sonWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlMan headbutts thug who is beating his ex-wife in Turkish streetEDL founder Tommy Robinson arrested by police outside court\u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mobTrump threatens to push German luxury cars out of the USShocking moment fight breaks out between two bus passengers    Barr came under fire on the very night the revival of Roseanne premiered in April when she accused Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg of giving a \u0027Nazi Salute\u0027.Barr swiftly took the tweet down and claimed that she had seen a \u0027doctored\u0027 image of Hogg. But internet sleuths found a grab of Barr\u0027s original tweet, which revealed she was commenting on picture of Hogg raising his fist at the March For Our Lives rally. That same week, Barr also made headlines when she tweeted about a bizarre right-wing conspiracy theory claiming Trump broke up a pedophile ring created by Democratic politicians.  Barr claimed that it was Trump who had freed \u0027so many children held in bondage to pimps all over this world\u0027.           In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope UC Davis gets nuked\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel\u0027He has broken up trafficking rings in high places everywhere. notice that. I disagree on some things, but give him benefit of doubt-4 now,\u0027 she added. The tweet was similar to when, in 2015, Barr revealed that she believed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex-ring in a pizza shop. \u0027Americans! The reason #DEMOCRATS aren\u0027t approving #Sessions is bc he will prosecure #HRC – and make arrests over PedoGate RT THIS!! WAKE UP!!\u0027Barr was slammed and derided for the tweets. She later apologized for mentioning child trafficking and said Twitter was \u0027not the place for it\u0027. In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope all the jews leave UC Davis and then it gets nuked!\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel           In 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rightsIn 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rights. \u0027Women do not want your penises forced in their faces or in private bathrooms. Respect that,\u0027 she wrote.  After the comedian\u0027s most recent Twitter controversies came to light, Walt Disney President Ben Sherwood responded that \u0027you can\u0027t control Roseanne Barr\u0027.\u0027Many who have tried have failed. She\u0027s the one and only,\u0027 he added. But as Tuesday\u0027s news has proved, you can still cancel here.                         \u0027You\u0027re a racist pig \u0026amp ABC should be ashamed that they give you a platform,\u0027 another added. Roseanne later tweeted, in an attempt to defend herself, that \u0027Islam is not a race\u0027. \u0027Islam includes EVERY RACE of people,\u0027 she added, still without acknowledging the fact that there is no evidence Jarrett has ties to the Islamic faith. She also retweeted an article whose headline read: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027 About an hour later, Roseanne apologized and said she was leaving Twitter.     \u0027I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans,\u0027 she wrote in a separate tweet. \u0027I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me-my joke was in bad taste.\u0027         \u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mobEDL founder Tommy Robinson arrested by police outside courtYoung boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hug\u0027I\u0027m not buying her book\u0027: Emily Hunt on Greer\u0027s rape commentsMichael Rotondo talks his mental health and losing his sonWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlMan headbutts thug who is beating his ex-wife in Turkish streetShocking moment cyclist pulls knife on driver in fit of road rageTrump threatens to push German luxury cars out of the USShocking moment fight breaks out between two bus passengersPolice officers attend stabbing crime scene in Chelsea, London    Much like its revival, Roseanne was an almost instant success when it premiered in 1988 and quickly became the umber one show on television It also turned Barr, who previously performed stand-up comedy on Johnny Carson\u0027s Tonight Show, into a household name. The show ran for nine seasons, featuring numerous storylines that were rare for network sitcoms in the nineties.   The show  tackled episodes that focused on taboo topics for the times like homophobia, abortion, teen pregnancy, masturbation, and domestic abuse.Barr, who has a lesbian sister and a gay brother, also made sure to feature a number of LGBT characters on the show. One episode of the show even featured Roseanne contemplating whether or not she should have an abortion, while others discussed previously taboo topics like masturbation.           The show ran for nine seasons, featuring numerous storylines that were rare for network sitcoms in the nineties - such as issues paying bills and homophobia The show won both Barr and Laurie Metcalf, who played her sister, respective Emmy Awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. It also won the prestigious Peabody Award in 1992. ABC announced in May 2017 that it planned to do a revival of the beloved series, which aired in March of the following year. The news garnered controversy from the beginning when it was revealed Roseanne would return as a pro-Trump grandmother. It also featured episodes that include her husband Dan, played by John Goodman, losing his job to an illegal immigrant and Roseanne\u0027s fears after finding out her new next-door neighbors are Muslim.

One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous systemfamilywealth will NEVER b taken from me.\u0027That comment came hours after Barr retweeted an outlandish statement suggesting that Michelle Obama played a role in her firing.       She suggested Michelle Obama was behind her firing by retweeting two unsourced claims alleging that the former first lady conspired with Channing Dungey ahead of ABC\u0027s decision          \u0027According to sources ABC President Channing Dungey had a long conversation via phone with former First Lady Michelle Obama before deciding to cancel the Roseanne show,\u0027 read the tweet. \u0027Michelle Obama was reportedly enraged and insisted an apology was inadequate.\u0027Barr also retweeted a post that further suggested this was an attempt by the Obamas to get revenge after she mocked the couple\u0027s Netflix deal with a hashtag last week that became a trending topic.\u0027Interesting. A few days after the popular #ObmasNetflixShows was all over the place making people giggle. Not surprised and I would not doubt it being very true,\u0027 read the post that Barr shared with her followers.These were just two of the conspiracy theories retweeted by Barr in the wake of the show\u0027s cancellation.    ABC decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 on Tuesday just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          Valerie Jarrett has spoken out on the controversy surrounding Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets, saying the ABC made the right decision to cancel her show          Roseanne caused outrage when she compared ex-Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape on Twitter           Keeping above the fray: Barr also retweeted an inidual who suggested the Obamas, who employed and are close friends with Valerie Jarrett, did this as revenge because Barr mocked their $50 million Netflix deal (l to r: Jarrett, Michelle and Barack in 2014)It comes after her ex-husband Tom Arnold told CNN\u0027s Anderson Cooper that he wasn\u0027t surprised and it was only a matter of time before all hell broke loose. Arnold - who was a writer on the original Rosanne series - claimed that Barr\u0027s politics and social media showed that she was obsessed with the conspiracy theories that Donald Trump has been feeding to the masses.  \u0027This monkey thing is something that she tweeted before about black people, its a meme that she and thousands of her alt-right fans do. They love to call black people monkeys, it\u0027s not a one time joke,\u0027 Arnold said. \u0027They can do this because we have a white trash racist president. That\u0027s a fact!\u0027Arnold shared his disgust with how Trump was only concerned with how the media had treated him when news of Barr\u0027s tweets made their way to him.        Meanwhile, Barr\u0027s son Jake shared text exchanges with his mother on Wednesday to seemingly prove she was not racist.\u0027Her and her dad, I thought they were white,\u0027 Barr wrote in a text message she purportedly sent her son.She followed that up by saying: \u0027I would never have called a black woman an ape I\u0027m not stupid!\u0027 That is a lie however, with Barr having called former national security advisor Susan Rice just that in a 2014 tweet. The third text stated: \u0027I thought she was Jewish of Iranian.\u0027 Her son captioned the image by writing: \u0027Mom and I are too dumb for the internet lol.           On Wednesday, actor Tom Arnold appeared on AC360 to share that he wasn\u0027t surprised when ABC pulled the plug on the \u0027Roseanne\u0027 reboot  Contextual: Her son also shared text messages that he and his mother purportedly exchanged in which Barr writes that she thought Jarrett was \u0027white\u0027 and \u0027Iranian,\u0027 posted eight hours after the show was cancelled            Commander-in-chief: President Trump complained that ABC president Bob Iger \u0027never ... apologized for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC\u0027Barr had previously blasted two of her co-stars for speaking out against her in tweets posted around midnight.Hours after claiming she was quitting Twitter, Barr began to rail against her critics while also posting an occasional apology.Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show and started working with Barr when he was just six, was the first to feel the wrath of the show\u0027s creator after he released a statement criticizing her racist tweet saying Jarrett looks like the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027I condemn these statements vehemently,\u0027 wrote Fishman, who is the father of a black daughter in the reboot. \u0027They are reprehensible and intolerable, contradicting my beliefs and outlook on life and society. I have always lived and taught my children to be inclusive. I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.\u0027Barr was none too happy with that statement and fired back on Twitter. \u0027I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!\u0027, she wrote.Fishman responded, stating: \u0027You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that.\u0027Barr fired back: \u0027Please leave me alone, thanks.\u0027             Michael Fishman, who played D.J.

Five...Italy lurches towards yet another poll if a ruling...Share this article    Far-right League leader Matteo Salvini (pictured) was named interior minister He took control of the rightwing coalition that won the most votes in March\u0027s election when his League party surpassed ally Silvio Berlusconi\u0027s Forza Italia.Since taking over the old Northern League in 2013, Salvini has ridden a wave of public discontent, playing on anti-immigrant sentiment as he sought to shift the party\u0027s image from defender of the wealthy north against its \u0027parasite\u0027 south, to that of guardian of Italy\u0027s national sovereignty.Now he\u0027s heading into government with southerner Luigi Di Maio and the Five Star Movement, which picked up the vast majority of its seats in the south.Since Salvini took over the League, nearly 700,000 people have landed in Italy after crossing the Mediterranean sparking a sense of resentment among many Italians who feel Europe has abandoned them - a sentiment which he has successfully exploited.Salvini, who in 2009 was caught on video singing songs about \u0027stinking\u0027 Neapolitans and in 2012 said the south didn\u0027t deserve the euro, represents impoverished southern region Calabria in the Senate and has redirected his regional chauvinism to take the League nationwide. Born and raised in Milan in 1973, Salvini joined what was then the Northern League in 1990, aged just 17, rising quickly through the ranks.At the time, the Northern League was a regional party known for its separatist campaign to secede from Italy, with Salvini making his name while running its Radio Padania - the wealthier northern region they wanted to see independent.One of his shows was called \u0027Never Say Italy\u0027 and in 2011, he won notoriety for boycotting Italy\u0027s 150-year anniversary celebrations, putting his desk outside Milan city hall to show he was working.\u0027The Tricolore doesn\u0027t represent me,\u0027 Salvini said of the Italian flag in 2014.But by 2018, he was campaigning as far south as Matera in the impoverished Basilicata region, where he promised \u0027order, rules, cleanliness\u0027 and railed against \u0027out of control\u0027 immigration.In a recent video on his Facebook page, which has more than two million fans, Salvini said he would work to \u0027stop the landings\u0027 once in power.He opposes same-sex unions, wants to deport foreign criminals and to bulldoze Roma camps.And as talks were under way to form the new government, he posted a photo of himself standing next to a bulldozer on Twitter with the message: \u0027We\u0027re working for you.\u0027 Since taking over the League, Salvini has forged alliances with other far-right Europeans like France\u0027s National Front and Dutch anti-Muslim politician Geert Wilders.Despite positive words for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Salvini in 2013 called the EU a \u0027gulag\u0027 like the \u0027Soviet Union\u0027 saying he would work to try and leave it.He has kept immigration high on the agenda, and has pointed the finger at \u0027an invasion\u0027 as responsible for the racist gun rampage in February in central Italy in which a self-proclaimed fascist shot six Africans.A savvy social media user, he has managed to successfully push his agenda online, updating his followers daily with constant updates, live videos, photos and even pictures of what he eats.Although happy to talk about his two children - 14-year-old Federico and Mirta, five - he is less happy to discuss his complicated love life.Currently living with glamorous model and TV presenter Elisa Isoardi, his children are from two previous relationships, one with ex-wife Fabrizia Ieluzzi, a political journalist, and the other with former girlfriend Giulia Martinelli.                                                      In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Cottarelli announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government.\u0027The formation of a political government is by far the best solution for the country, because it avoids the uncertainty that would arise with new elections,\u0027 said Cottarelli after meeting with Mattarella. The programme proposed by the populists promises to revive Italy\u0027s sluggish economy by rejecting austerity and increasing spending.Their ambitious economic proposals - which include a universal basic income for Italy\u0027s poorest, rolling back pension reform and a two tier flat tax - have worried Brussels and financial markets given the country\u0027s sizeable debt.  Italy\u0027s 2.3 trillion euros of debt is 132 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), the highest ratio in Europe apart from Greece and more than double the bloc\u0027s 60-percent ceiling.The government programme includes plans to speed up expulsions of illegal immigrants and crack down on trafficking. The eurosceptic coalition also promises a series of measures to reign in the EU including renegotiation of EU treaties and a review of the bloc\u0027s economic governance on issues such as the single currency.  But on Thursday EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker warned against blaming the EU for all of Italy\u0027s problems.\u0027I\u0027m in deep love with Italy, Bella Italia. But I no longer accept that everything which is going wrong in South of Italy, in Mezzogiorno, is explained by the fact that the EU or the European Commission would not do enough,\u0027 he said after leaving a meeting in Brussels.\u0027Italians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work, less corruption, seriousness.\u0027He urged Italy not to \u0027play this game\u0027 of holding the EU responsible, adding \u0027Nations first, Europe second.\u0027 Political neophyte Conte skipped teaching a class at the University of Florence to return to Rome after he was summoned to meet Mattarella at the presidential palace on Thursday night.            In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Carlo Cottarelli (pictured) announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/07/00/4BEDF47900000578-0-image-m-6_1525650145624.jpg","title":"Children talk dress write properly 4 says Ofsted report","story":"    Children are starting school unable to speak properly, dress themselves or even use the toilet, claims the head of Ofsted.

I am convinced that Abramovich made this decision with the approval and possibly the explicit instructions of Putin.As we all know, Putin is cold-blooded and cut-throat when dealing with those who have offended him.He came to power 18 years ago through his unswerving commitment to crush Chechnya’s separatists. He went on to seize Crimea from Ukraine, is held responsible for the 2014 downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet carrying 298 people and his secret police goons have been accused of assassinating enemies such as tycoon Boris Berezovsky and former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko.In other words, Putin does not take kindly to being snubbed.The same applies to Abramovich, who learned the ways of the world at Putin’s feet.The friendship between the two men goes back nearly a quarter of a century.One persistent, though unconfirmed, rumour, is that when the ailing Russian leader Boris Yeltsin was looking for a successor in 1999, Abramovich – then a young man with powerful business allies – suggested that Putin should be made prime minister. Yeltsin did just that.  Roman Abramovich (left with ex-wife Dasha Zhukova), who was last pictured at Chelsea with Guus Hiddink in December (right), is said to have personally pulled the plug on the £1billion stadium plan after his visa row Abramovich, who started life in Moscow as a mechanic, selling retreaded tyres as a sideline, acquired substantial stakes in the oil and gas industries as the Communist state broke apart.If mystery surrounds some of his early business deals, there is no mystery about how he hangs on to his wealth: he maintains a tungsten-strength friendship with Putin.Putin never lets old enmities die, and Abramovich is the same. When Abramovich fell out spectacularly with his business associate Berezovsky, the pair faced each other in court in 2012.Berezovsky claimed £3billion in damages from Abramovich for intimidating him into selling shares in Russian oil giant Sibneft.The Chelsea owner won the case, in which legal costs were estimated to be £100million. Asked if he felt Putin would be happy with the ruling, Berezovsky replied: ‘Sometimes I have the impression that Putin himself wrote this judgment.’Roman Abramovich\u0027s new Israeli passport WON\u0027T guarantee him...Roman Abramovich SCRAPS plans for Chelsea\u0027s new £1bn stadium...Share this articleOf course, Abramovich’s difficulties in obtaining a UK visa must be set in the context of the Salisbury poisonings and the subsequent major row between London and Moscow with the UK expelling 23 Russian diplomats.His decision to halt development plans at Chelsea fit a pattern and chime with Moscow’s bitterness over what it calls ‘insinuations’ from the British authorities around the Skripal case.While most of the Western world is convinced that Moscow orchestrated the attack on British soil, the Russian government refutes the allegations as groundless.All this strongly suggests that a message is being sent from Moscow to London – and that Abramovich is the messenger.Chelsea fans may be upset about not getting a bigger stadium but this is becoming a much wider and more dangerous game. That said, Putin understands how powerful a weapon sport can be.          Mr Abramovich is a known ally of Vladimir Putin and has found his visa application at the centre of a row between Theresa May and the Russian President over the Salisbury poisoningHe cynically turned the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, on the Black Sea coast, into a gigantic ego-trip for himself. He will do exactly the same with this month’s football World Cup which he is hosting in Russia.But he is offended by criticism of Russia’s human rights record and can’t be happy that Prince William and British politicians will not attend the tournament – a decision made following the Salisbury poisonings.To some extent, Abramovich’s behaviour is blatant retaliation on behalf of his buddy in the Kremlin.I believe this might be just the start of Abramovich’s cold-shouldering of Britain.If Britain doesn’t want him, he doesn’t want Britain.Asked once where he considered home, he said: ‘I live on a plane. I like to visit London. If I had to think where I could live if not Moscow, London would be my first choice and second would be New York. In Moscow, I feel most comfortable.’That love of London has died.Just before Christmas, amid claims that the Russian government had meddled in the Brexit referendum, Putin’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov admitted: ‘It’s no secret that our relations are at a low point.’Without doubt, after the Salisbury poisonings and Abramovich’s eruption yesterday, it’s clear that relations have got much lower.Mark Almond is the director of the Crisis Research Institute, Oxford"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/23/4CCC5B3300000578-5793155-image-a-19_1527805570168.jpg","title":"George Osborne faces backlash cash editorial claims London Evening Standard","story":"     George Osborne was embroiled in a row over claims that London\u0027s Evening Standard promised \u0027money-can\u0027t-buy\u0027 coverage to big businesses for £3millionFormer Chancellor George Osborne was  embroiled in a row on Thursday over claims that London\u0027s Evening Standard promised \u0027money-can\u0027t-buy\u0027 coverage to big businesses for £3million.The newspaper faced accusations it had effectively sold positive news coverage to brands including Google and the controversial taxi app Uber, in return for sponsorship of a planned campaign.The two were among six firms to each pay £500,000 to be part of the paper\u0027s \u0027London 2020\u0027 project which will highlight issues including air pollution and housing.The Evening Standard said it had agreed partnerships to support its campaign but denied the deals threatened its editorial integrity and independence.

Five...Italy lurches towards yet another poll if a ruling...Share this article    Far-right League leader Matteo Salvini (pictured) was named interior minister He took control of the rightwing coalition that won the most votes in March\u0027s election when his League party surpassed ally Silvio Berlusconi\u0027s Forza Italia.Since taking over the old Northern League in 2013, Salvini has ridden a wave of public discontent, playing on anti-immigrant sentiment as he sought to shift the party\u0027s image from defender of the wealthy north against its \u0027parasite\u0027 south, to that of guardian of Italy\u0027s national sovereignty.Now he\u0027s heading into government with southerner Luigi Di Maio and the Five Star Movement, which picked up the vast majority of its seats in the south.Since Salvini took over the League, nearly 700,000 people have landed in Italy after crossing the Mediterranean sparking a sense of resentment among many Italians who feel Europe has abandoned them - a sentiment which he has successfully exploited.Salvini, who in 2009 was caught on video singing songs about \u0027stinking\u0027 Neapolitans and in 2012 said the south didn\u0027t deserve the euro, represents impoverished southern region Calabria in the Senate and has redirected his regional chauvinism to take the League nationwide. Born and raised in Milan in 1973, Salvini joined what was then the Northern League in 1990, aged just 17, rising quickly through the ranks.At the time, the Northern League was a regional party known for its separatist campaign to secede from Italy, with Salvini making his name while running its Radio Padania - the wealthier northern region they wanted to see independent.One of his shows was called \u0027Never Say Italy\u0027 and in 2011, he won notoriety for boycotting Italy\u0027s 150-year anniversary celebrations, putting his desk outside Milan city hall to show he was working.\u0027The Tricolore doesn\u0027t represent me,\u0027 Salvini said of the Italian flag in 2014.But by 2018, he was campaigning as far south as Matera in the impoverished Basilicata region, where he promised \u0027order, rules, cleanliness\u0027 and railed against \u0027out of control\u0027 immigration.In a recent video on his Facebook page, which has more than two million fans, Salvini said he would work to \u0027stop the landings\u0027 once in power.He opposes same-sex unions, wants to deport foreign criminals and to bulldoze Roma camps.And as talks were under way to form the new government, he posted a photo of himself standing next to a bulldozer on Twitter with the message: \u0027We\u0027re working for you.\u0027 Since taking over the League, Salvini has forged alliances with other far-right Europeans like France\u0027s National Front and Dutch anti-Muslim politician Geert Wilders.Despite positive words for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Salvini in 2013 called the EU a \u0027gulag\u0027 like the \u0027Soviet Union\u0027 saying he would work to try and leave it.He has kept immigration high on the agenda, and has pointed the finger at \u0027an invasion\u0027 as responsible for the racist gun rampage in February in central Italy in which a self-proclaimed fascist shot six Africans.A savvy social media user, he has managed to successfully push his agenda online, updating his followers daily with constant updates, live videos, photos and even pictures of what he eats.Although happy to talk about his two children - 14-year-old Federico and Mirta, five - he is less happy to discuss his complicated love life.Currently living with glamorous model and TV presenter Elisa Isoardi, his children are from two previous relationships, one with ex-wife Fabrizia Ieluzzi, a political journalist, and the other with former girlfriend Giulia Martinelli.                                                      In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Cottarelli announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government.\u0027The formation of a political government is by far the best solution for the country, because it avoids the uncertainty that would arise with new elections,\u0027 said Cottarelli after meeting with Mattarella. The programme proposed by the populists promises to revive Italy\u0027s sluggish economy by rejecting austerity and increasing spending.Their ambitious economic proposals - which include a universal basic income for Italy\u0027s poorest, rolling back pension reform and a two tier flat tax - have worried Brussels and financial markets given the country\u0027s sizeable debt.  Italy\u0027s 2.3 trillion euros of debt is 132 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), the highest ratio in Europe apart from Greece and more than double the bloc\u0027s 60-percent ceiling.The government programme includes plans to speed up expulsions of illegal immigrants and crack down on trafficking. The eurosceptic coalition also promises a series of measures to reign in the EU including renegotiation of EU treaties and a review of the bloc\u0027s economic governance on issues such as the single currency.  But on Thursday EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker warned against blaming the EU for all of Italy\u0027s problems.\u0027I\u0027m in deep love with Italy, Bella Italia.

I read The Hobbit until it fell apart as a child, and have always strived, in my own contributions to the genre, to take even a shred of the care in my world-building that Tolkien did in his. “It is written in my life-blood,” he said of The Lord of the Rings, “such as that is, thick or thin and I can no other.” A rallying cry for anyone who has known what it is to inhabit a world of one’s own.“Tolkien was a genius with a unique approach to literature,” says Richard Ovenden, Bodley’s Librarian at the University of Oxford. “His imagined world was created through a combination of his deep scholarship, his rich imagination and powerful creative talent, and informed by his own lived experiences. We are incredibly proud to hold the Tolkien archive and to be able to share so many previously unseen items in this once-in-a-generation exhibition.”An exhibition, Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth, is at the Weston Library in Oxford until October. Visiting before it opens, with preparations still ongoing, I must rely a little on my imagination to colour between the lines. We pass the skeleton of what will be the main entrance to the exhibition I am told by its curator, Catherine McIlwaine, that the Doors of Durin will be projected into this dark passageway to welcome visitors.At the heart of the gallery is a model that will chart the routes taken by Tolkien’s characters through the landscape of Middle-earth. As McIlwaine talks me through the items, I find that seeing the exhibition in this liminal state lends an unexpected resonance to the experience. After all, never is a story more alive than when it is in progress. Though many authors have since found great success in his genre, Tolkien, born in 1892, is unrivalled in his reputation as a meticulous creator who knew his world down to the last blade of grass. Today, Tolkien might have come to represent the old guard of fantasy – the “locker room” that the late Ursula K LeGuin once derided. Yet fierce passion for his work endures, and even his harshest critics will concede that few creators have succeeded in building a paracosm that touches the depth of Middle-earth. Every so often, a new offering will stoke the coals of Tolkienmania – Beren and Lúthien was published in 2017, and this August The Fall of Gondolin will expand on another story from The Silmarillion. Meanwhile Amazon has signed a deal for an ambitious TV adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. Throughout my career as a writer, I have found Tolkien to be a source of both self-doubt and inspiration. On the one hand, it can be tempting to give up in the face of his brilliance. He began to invent his first Elvish language when he was a student at Oxford, and eventually built a “Tree of Tongues” – one of the items on display in the exhibition – that charted his constructed languages from source. McIlwaine tells me about a painting Tolkien did when he should have been studying for his finals, of the realm of Valinor. “In 1915, it was all there, already in his head,” she explains. Dwelling on this too deeply could induce an existential crisis. More often, however, the knowledge of how fully Tolkien inhabited his work is a catalyst and a beacon. It fuels me to build larger, to dream weirder and to push harder at the bounds of my imagination.Exhibitions of the Bodleian’s extensive Tolkien collection are rare. Kept in a strongroom with four papyrus scrolls from Herculaneum, the material is tested before and after display and shown in the same womb-like darkness that wraps the Book of Kells in Dublin. Given the importance of preserving the collection, there has been no major exhibition for 26 years. After finishing its run in October, it will travel to New York, then to the Bibliothèque nationale de France. This is the first time the latter will host an exhibition about a foreign author. It is all too easy to believe in the myth of the professor as the one true god of a world he knew in its entirety. The truth, however, is more complex. Tolkien was not always sure of himself. A notebook page reveals that Gandalf once had the Elvish name Bladorthin, meaning grey wanderer. Gandalf, it turns out, was the original name of Thorin Oakenshield. Tolkien flickers between names in the text, as if torn. “He spoke about sub-creation,” McIlwaine says, “and I think this tied into his religious beliefs that all talents and gifts come from God. God is the one creator, and what we do is in imitation of that. Tolkien was a very humble man.” There is abundant evidence of his humility. He was uncertain of his skill as an artist, responsive to criticism, and went out of his way to seek feedback from his friends and children. He could also make the most absent-minded of mistakes – for instance, when he forgot to write his own name on the manuscript title page of The Hobbit.More than 200 items will be on show at the Weston Library, many for the first time – including personal objects donated by the Tolkien family, such as a pipe and a briefcase. Among my favourites is a letter from a fan who has attempted to write a poem in Elvish, which Tolkien has translated and annotated. He was confident enough in his grasp of his world to know when its rules were broken. Rules, after all, are vital in the creation of what he called “secondary belief” in an invented setting – yet he would have been the first to admit that there were uncharted places in Middle-earth.“I don’t desire to go and have afternoons talking Elvish to chaps,” he once said. “Elvish is too complicated. I’ve never finished making it.”Although Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth will be free to attend, this is the first exhibition at the Bodleian to be ticketed. “I think people are going to be surprised,” McIlwaine tells me. “We don’t know what they will bring with them, but I’d like them to leave with the impression of the whole man and his work – not just Tolkien as the maker of Middle-earth, but as a scholar, a young professor, a father of four children.” In this, I believe McIlwaine has succeeded. I am comforted to have glimpsed the man behind the myth, and I am more inspired than ever by the scope of his creation.The final item I admire is a gathering of patterns in black ink, on the back of a meeting agenda. Its title, written in Quenya, is Parma Mittarion, or “book of enterings”. It was probably intended to be a book cover, but what the book was to contain remains a mystery. Long after I leave the exhibition, my imagination runs wild. I ask myself what Tolkien intended for this book, whether he ever wrote it – either in his mind or on lost pages – and what he could have meant by the phrase “light in the eye”, which he tucked among the decoration. I realise I am beginning to write a story between the lines, and that anyone who looks at the page will perhaps do the same.

Membership of the currency meant the public investment they desired was impossible. “It’s like social democracy was forbidden,” he explains. But exiting the euro could be even worse, because of the resulting economic trauma, and the political party held responsible would incur such public wrath that it would surely vanish.Italy’s new government is certainly not social democratic, or remotely left of centre. It is a stitch-up between the Five Star Movement’s (M5S) peculiar brand of centrist populism and the League’s xenophobic nationalism. It does not offer the answers to Italy’s profound ailments. The left in Italy has largely vacated the political stage: the sort of disillusioned young voters who flocked to Spain’s radical Podemos party or Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour have instead opted for M5S. But the Italian populists’ assumption of power is, in part, the consequence of the devastating economic consequences of the current incarnation of the eurozone. If the eurozone – perhaps even the European Union – is to survive, radical change is desperately needed.Backlash against the refugee crisis has played its part, too. But Italy is a nation in economic and social crisis. Both economic output and living standards have stagnated for two decades. Almost one in three young Italians are without work. Since the financial crash a decade ago, the number of Italians at risk of poverty has soared by more than 3 million. From the beginning, the currency has suited Germany because a weak euro is good for its exports. Italy’s problems cannot be blamed exclusively on the eurozone: but its strict fiscal rules have tied the nation’s hands. The ousted Democratic party was hardly leftwing either – despite its origins in the old Communist party, it is a thoroughly neoliberal outfit – but even its former prime minister Matteo Renzi called unsuccessfully for the rules to be changed to enable him to invest.That is not good enough. When Greece’s Syriza suffered its punishment beating, the European council president Donald Tusk said it was “ideological or political contagion” that he feared, not “financial contagion”. Greece had to be taught a lesson, in other words, to discourage Spain, Portugal and Italy from electing their own anti-austerity challenges to the eurozone. The continuation of this approach spells disaster, not just for millions who have suffered because of austerity, but the future of the eurozone and the EU. A new Socialist government has come to power in Spain: it must now try to build a coalition of change within the EU. If the EU does not budge, then calamity beckons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04cb9361950d6ef0fbe18e45c09983bcdf7a08ed/0_151_4429_2658/master/4429.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7600addbac10705e3c59253546d0ad5b","title":"catholic crosses far right bay multicultural bavaria","story":"Christian symbols in all public buildings: it’s a political gamble that could go badly wrong in Germany’s ‘laptop and lederhosen’ stateToday the German state of Bavaria will formally renounce the ideal of multiculturalism. All public buildings will be required to display a “clearly visible” crucifix near the entrance. Crosses already hang in Bavarian class- and courtrooms and many town halls. Now ministries, jobcentres, municipal hospitals and police stations must follow suit. Fearing civil disobedience, universities and theatres have been granted an exemption from the executive order of Bavaria’s new first minister, Markus Söder, to underline “Bavaria’s cultural and historical heritage”.At first blush, this seems to put Söder in the same camp as Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbàn, who promotes “Christian democracy”, a term he uses interchangeably with “illiberal democracy”: a nationalist, anti-immigrant, antisemitic, Eurosceptic and authoritarian brand of populism. Or with Jaroslav Kaczyński’s governing Law and Justice party in Poland, and similar populist outfits in eastern Europe.But Bavaria is different. Different from the rest of Germany, and from the ex-Communist countries to its east and south-east. It is the only German state to have been ruled by one party – the Christian Social Union (CSU) – since the Federal Republic was founded in 1949. The CSU has an agreement with the Christian Democrats (CDU) not to poach on one another’s turf. This has allowed the CSU to pander to Bavaria’s rural and conservative population in a way that the more inclusive CDU could never dare. At the same time, the business-friendly CSU has transformed Bavaria from an agricultural poorhouse into an industrial powerhouse – think BMW and Audi, Siemens and Bosch, biotech, AI and financial services. “Laptop and lederhosen” is how the Bavarians – who enjoy Germany’s lowest unemployment rate and highest incomes – describe the CSU’s mix of folksy populism and determined modernisation.It’s a difficult balancing act, and the rise of the rightwing AfD – Alternative für Deutschland, the true German exponents of the Orbàn-Kaczyński brand of populism – combined with Angela Merkel’s swerve to the left on immigration and energy policies has made it harder. To take one example: when Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s minister of the interior, was Söder’s predecessor as Bavaria’s leader, he constantly goaded the chancellor by calling for a reduction in the number of refugees entering Germany to 200,000 per year. A few years ago, that seemed bold. Now the government has adopted Seehofer’s “upper limit”, but the AfD is demanding closed borders and massive repatriation. There’s no way the CSU can go down that path, not least because industry wants more immigration, not less.In this situation, Söder has taken a leaf from the Zentrum: a pre-1933 party of political Catholicism. Although National Socialism originated in Bavaria, the Nazis were unsuccessful in Catholic areas until the future Pope Pius XII made a deal with Hitler in 1933 and agreed to disband the Zentrum in return for the protection of Catholic institutions. Söder, who is facing elections to the Bavarian parliament in October, seems to hope that religious feeling will prove an antidote to political radicalism, and that conservative Catholics will rally to the CSU as they once did to the Zentrum.He could be wrong. Under Pope Francis, the Vatican is no longer the conservative bastion it was under John Paul II and the Bavarian Benedict XVI. Cardinal Reinhard Marx, archbishop of Munich, who heads the Conference of German Bishops, has criticised Söder for trying to instrumentalise a religious symbol for political aims. More to the point, Bavaria’s modernisation has meant that the once backward and priest-ridden society is now better educated, and that Catholics, though still the majority, are more independent of the church. Few Catholic voters will be swayed by church leaders who condemn the AfD, still less politicians who hang up crosses in job centres.Meanwhile, Bavaria is becoming ever more multicultural. Almost a quarter of the population have what Germans call “a migration background”. And for the first time since the war, more people are leaving Bavaria for other parts of Germany than the other way around. The most popular destination for Bavarians is Berlin – the epitome of decadence and religious indifference, not to mention multiculturalism and everything Bavaria is not supposed to be. Trying to bridge the chasm between a globalist, liberal elite and the rising number of the disaffected and disenchanted, Söder is more to be pitied than censured for his crucifix gambit.• Alan Posener, a German blogger, writes for the papers Die Welt and Welt am Sonntag"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fe739585865199faa135c3f9dfdc4c8ca8f5ebf/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7992304ab2351ccfda3a28844677f6f","title":"revive british city channel 4 north south divide","story":"There is nothing more gauche than Whitehall “being nice” to the provinces. Its attempt to force Channel\u0026nbsp4 to move north from London has felt akin to the Victorian church sending missionaries overseas to civilise the heathen. As austerity descends over museums and theatres across the land, the culture department wants to dispatch a few television executives to live among the natives, to introduce them to kale, quinoa and turmeric lattes. That\u0026nbspshould cheer them up.Whitehall also seems to want to have some fun. No one has instructed Channel 4 where to go. Instead, the provincial cities are told they must line up like children in a workhouse and beg. London will decide who gets the smashed avocado. There will be two consolation “creative hubs” for the runners-up, wherever the judges\u0026nbspcan find something approximating Shoreditch High Street. Whitehall loves these beauty contests. Whether they’re for cities of culture, or the Commonwealth Games, or Michael Heseltine’s “city challenge” handouts, ministers like to bask in the gratitude of the winner, while the losers can slink away to lick their wounds. British regional policy is an\u0026nbspexercise in provincial humiliation.Channel 4 was adamant that it would not move, despite a Tory 2017 manifesto pledge to make it. Now the government has backed down, and less than a third of the staff, just 300, will up sticks. When I heard that Whitehall still wanted a competition, even for what cannot be more than a small office block, I assumed any self-respecting city would tell it to clear off. In the event, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool, Leeds, Cardiff and Glasgow all formed the usual queue, preening and shouting: “Please, me, me, me.”On one point the government is right. Today’s urban\u0026nbsprenewal is not about manufacturing or traditional\u0026nbspservices but about “creative hubs”. The urbanist Richard\u0026nbspFlorida long ago pointed out that a broad spectrum of creative industries, from education to marketing and design, held the key to bright young people generating wealth in cities. The digital revolution, far from letting them disperse, seemed to require them to congregate, most markedly in older “bohemian” districts. They crammed into San Francisco’s Castro and New York’s Soho, as they gravitated to London’s Shoreditch and Silicon Roundabout. All they needed was\u0026nbspa warehouse, some craft beer and somewhere that day-life fused with nightlife, and every street corner was\u0026nbspa chance encounter. Florida was mocked at the time,\u0026nbspbut he was right.British provincial cities are starting to develop such places. You find them in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, Birmingham’s Gas Street Basin, Sheffield’s Kelham Island and Leeds’s canal-side. They have been underpinned by Britain’s biggest urban growth industry by far: higher education. Today, more people occupy Tyneside’s universities than ever worked in its shipbuilding industry. A graduate school is worth a dozen Channel 4s.Unfortunately, you can bring bright young people to a city, but you cannot make them stay, let alone “create”. Two-thirds of Birmingham’s student population plans to leave on graduation, compared with just a third of London’s. In 2014, economist Jim\u0026nbspO’Neill’s city commission even suggested that graduates who stayed working where they graduated should have their loans repaid. When I met a group of employers in Manchester, their biggest complaint was not a lack of Channel 4, but that all their brightest children wanted to leave for London as soon as possible.The government is right to want to direct some creative energy away from the capital. But Channel\u0026nbsp4 is small fry. Creative hubs are created not by fairy godmothers but by internal combustion. They need to be self-generated economic activity, emerging from a sense of buzz, from contacts creating opportunities. That is why the best thing Channel 4 offered Whitehall was not to move its headquarters but to double its commissioning spend in the provinces. It is not carpet-baggers but contracts that lubricate hubs.And ministers themselves should set an example. They should forget Channel 4 and take themselves out of London while the Palace of Westminster is refurbished. They can commandeer Birmingham city centre or Manchester town hall, bringing with them their aides and acolytes, researchers and journalists. And for the duration they might move the entire Treasury to Stoke-on-Trent. They would suddenly discover there is a Britain out there beyond their ken. I bet the regional imbalance would change overnight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b575aef5fa695e1ac39d8d652b48506e14c588dd/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a60451081da3b7f8589b7d8bae81da2","title":"tories northern powerhouse transport system cities george osborne","story":"It was easy to scoff when in 2014 George Osborne unveiled his vision for a “northern powerhouse”. When the government was simultaneously shredding local services in the region, many here suspected it might turn out to be a false dawn.Yet the principle that underpinned his thinking was sound. The north desperately needed a functioning infrastructure, as well as someone to knock heads together in Whitehall to get it moving. For the Conservatives it made sense, too: perhaps this could finally detoxify their northern brand.Yet as we approach the fourth anniversary of his flagship policy’s announcement, Osborne is now safely ensconced back in the capital. In his northern promised land, thousands upon thousands of people are unable to get trains in or out of Manchester, Liverpool, and myriad other towns and cities that were supposed to fire his powerhouse. The train operator Northern rail has been cancelling so many trains each day that an app, Northern Fail, has enterprisingly sprung up to help out northerners unable to make the most basic of journeys.The meltdown being experienced by passengers seems, in comparison to the chaos experienced by Southern or Thameslink commuters, to have gone largely unnoticed by opinion-formers in London.But for journalists here, the fiasco is impossible to ignore. Our Twitter feeds are as packed as a Manchester Piccadilly platform with desperate cries of fury from people trying to travel even the shortest of distances.Like the man who literally moved jobs a few weeks ago because he couldn’t reliably get to work on the train any more, even before things spiralled into further chaos. Or the woman who expressed disbelief this morning on finding every commuter train for nearly three hours from Gatley to Manchester – just an eight-mile journey – had been cancelled. Or the friend of mine who tried to do his usual trip to see his partner last Friday evening and found timetable changes had scrapped his normal train, then, after hanging around Manchester Piccadilly station for a couple of hours, discovered every other train had been cancelled too and so gave up and went home.It’s probably safe to say most people here are not all that bothered where the specific fault lies for the current chaos. While transport secretary Chris Grayling points the finger at Network Rail for its delayed electrification programme, local politicians are more inclined to believe the fault lies with the operator.Ultimately, however, the buck stops with a government that just four years ago made great, sweeping promises to the north of a historic economic rebalance in language that frequently evoked the industrial heritage of the rail network’s golden Victorian age. “Here are the hard economic facts,” said Osborne in his northern powerhouse speech at Manchester’s Museum of Science and Industry in June 2014. “In the 19th and 20th centuries, a factory would be located where you could find raw materials, power, and cheap labour. Today, in a services-based economy, what investors are looking for is not a river to dam, but access to a deep pool of human capital.”Much of that human capital is currently stuck on a platform.But if that “hard economic fact” can’t be felt in Westminster, here’s a hard political one: the Conservatives did not win a majority last summer. They did not, for example, win Bolton North East, where Theresa May launched her campaign a year ago, and commuters are now even more crippled by rail delays than they were then.A significant proportion of the northern powerhouse’s population are spending their time staring at a cancellation board.And while they may not be able to catch a train, they have plenty of time to think about how they might vote.• Jennifer Williams is social affairs editor of the Manchester Evening News"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25ed743457062d6f707123fbf1aa1b700690b20/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bcf81e447b84c22ef2fc2ccb109776e","title":"street cricket the sport transforming birmingham kids lives","story":"In inner-city areas where children have few facilities, it’s easy to fall in with a bad crowd. One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981. NatWest are proud to be the principal partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the official partners of Chance to Shine, reflecting the bank’s own values and commitment to fairness and inclusion.To find out more, visit Natwest Cricket"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d0d1d2e3c0e38130f9f81eefd0c842a63c5ea1c/574_247_2353_1412/master/2353.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=513198921c4d7e9b6b620cfcb11b918a","title":"yoko ono john lennon liverpool double fantasy","story":"She was labelled a witch and a band wrecker. Now, 38 years after the murder of her husband John Lennon, Yoko Ono is back in the Beatles’ home town to tell her story“Your life is being conducted in front of the world, like a play,” Yoko Ono tweeted recently. “Know that it is, therefore, a play to people who watch it.” That Ono is on Twitter makes utter sense: her aphorisms were almost like tweets before the thing was invented. She has always been ahead of her time. People seem to have hated her in so many ways that I assume she must see herself as a character in a story in order just to live, just to continue being her own woman.She is here now in front of me, a tiny woman in her shades and her hat tending to the final details of her exhibition in Liverpool, Double Fantasy. I see apples on Perspex plinths, to replicate the apple that an apparently rude John Lennon took a bite of when he met her at the Indica gallery in London. Ono, who for so long was ageless, is now 85 and needs a bit of help. I am told she is feeling emotional. She doesn’t do jetlag, apparently. The next day she will visit the house Lennon grew up in and sit in his bedroom, feeling him close.“She took him away from us,” a man in a pub tells me. “But she has always come back to Liverpool. She has not forgotten us.” His friends agree. There is a grudging respect now for a woman who was once seen a wrecker of the Beatles, an evil foreigner who stole away and bewitched a jaded and stupefied Lennon.She was regarded as a manipulative, clingy, talentless fake who somehow enchanted the superstar Beatle. All the loathing that was poured onto Ono is now quite difficult to read: misogyny laced with out-and-out racism. The music press and the art world policed the boundaries of femininity then and now – and Ono did not fit. The poisonous Albert Goldman book, The Lives of John Lennon, ascribed every stereotype about oriental women to her. She was the evil dragon lady who played the mute geisha. Lennon was the weak, flawed man manipulated by this cunning, grasping creature. It was OK, in 1988, for Goldman to describe her as “simian-looking”, to speculate on intimacies he could not have possibly known about.No wonder Ono wanted to tell her tale of their relationship in the place of Lennon’s birth, though this is not a setting-the-record-straight show exactly. The exhibition is called Double Fantasy. Maybe their coupling was a fantasy, maybe all relationships are, but here that fantasy is set in the context of world events. A simple love story perhaps, but the context was the tectonic plates that were shifting in 1966: Vietnam and the civil-rights movement are the backdrop. Their art is their response.To see objects that belonged to the couple is strangely moving. Ono’s sunglasses positioned opposite Lennon’s wire NHS specs, the lenses mirroring each other. The loss registers. I had met Ono before at some post-gig meet and greet. I did not know what to say. Oh Yoko. She had been on stage screaming in the voice of an abused child. Sean Lennon, their son, was there so it seemed easier to chat to him. She did not seem one for small talk somehow. I wanted to tell her I had seen the Beatles as a tiny child, taken by my uncle and been terrified. It was the first gig I ever went to. I don’t think we had “health and safety” in those days and they just hit the girls off stage with brooms. It was just screaming and screaming.When Lennon was murdered, I was working in a restaurant in Miami and made huge tips that night because I was English and kept crying while serving diners. That’s a long time ago and the Beatles don’t seem much in fashion any more. Fashion of course is something Ono knows very well. She loves clothes. She is always in black and white and she knows what she is doing.In one film in the show, when Lennon is being interviewed by Michael Parkinson, he asks why the press are calling Ono ugly. Why is that acceptable? Lennon explains the public perception. “This Japanese witch has made him crazy and he’s gone bananas. But … all she did was take the bananas part of me out of the closet that, you know, has been inhibited by another part.”Often in interviews Ono sits smoking and silent. That became a familiar image, but now we know differently. Ono hung on to Lennon because he was so insecure he would not let her out of his sight for a second. Indeed, Double Fantasy helps to reconfigure their relationship in ways that may finally balance. Instead of her leeching off him, maybe he was leeching off her. Maybe it was mutual. She was an artist, involved in Fluxus. She knew all the luminaries such as John Cage and had exhibited internationally. Like Lennon, she was married with a child. Like him, war was in her background: Liverpool had been bombed, Ono had had to flee Tokyo. As a child, she said, she looked like a ghost because of food shortages. She also said she never pursued a guy, that it was never her style, and that she wanted an equal relationship. “You can’t love someone unless you are in an equal position with them,” she declared in 1971. Lennon came into the relationship a violent man who had hit his first wife and was often cruel. Ono confronted this. She talked too of bisexuality. In the same year, Lennon told the underground newspaper Red Mole that she was into liberation before he came along. “She had to fight her way through a man’s world – the art world is completely dominated by men.” He described her revolutionary zeal: “There was never any question we had to have a 5050 relationship or there was no relationship.”This attempt at a personal and artistic collaboration was much mocked. Attempting equality seemed to push them further into their own bubble. That and, of course, heroin. But what else was Lennon to do with the massive celebrity that was eating at him? While Kanye West uses his power to support Trump, his partner flogs appetite-suppressing lollipops. Lennon and Ono were after a somewhat bigger prize: world peace. A deconstruction of masculine power and fake action. They would attract the press to their cause by staying in bed.The bed-ins, indeed many of couple’s concepts, have been relentlessly pilloried as simplistic, as a bit Hallmark, a bit Zen, as somehow not real art because conceptual art was not in vogue as it is now. Ono’s Cut Piece from 1964 – invoking rituals around gender and identity, vulnerability and dissent, in which audience members could cut off her clothes – is pre-Abramović. Her film Rape, her use of nudity in performance, her interest in primal scream therapy, her insistence that everyone could be an artist, the idea that art was always to be made in process with the spectator and it is the interaction not the product that matters – Lennon imbibed all these things that now feel completely contemporary.Not everything she did with Lennon worked, that’s for sure. The boundary between art and life was blurred by celebrity and money. Yet so much of their relationship was seen through the prism of race and patriarchy. It was not that they had an open relationship or needed to rethink. It was that she arranged for Lennon to have an affair with her assistant May Pang. She is the arch manipulator.Alongside this, Ono is playing with the power of the male gaze and returning it, with nude pictures of her and Lennon that are not flattering but entirely human. She made a film of Lennon’s penis and called it Self-Portrait. This is the woman who we are always told has no sense of humour. In 1964, she too started thinking about the female gaze, screening a Hollywood movie with the instruction: “Do not look at Rock Hudson, look only at Doris Day.”It seems sometimes as if Lennon’s star has waned, while hers has waxed – with many artists and musicians acknowledging her influence. So it is quite something for her to go back to Liverpool to document all the collaborations she made with Lennon. She cannot escape being defined by him, but she now gives us the holy relics of their relationship and sets them in history. The famous ladder from the Indica gallery, his shirt, the glasses, the bedclothes, the funny surreal instructions: “Imagine the cloud dripping  Dig a hole in your garden to put it in.”She said she was saying: “Please accept me  I am mad.” But there is a steeliness in her madness, in her presence here. Lennon needed her and was desperate to come back to her and have a child. She challenged power and violence, rejecting the macho idea of fighting for peace. “I wonder why men can get serious at all,” she muses in her 1964 book Grapefruit. “They have this delicate long thing hanging outside their bodies, which goes up and down by its own will.” She was clearly not seeking approval.As I was leaving the gallery, I saw too that she is still an activist. She may be old but she is indomitable. The world still needs to be changed. An exhibit had to be altered as the figures required updating. It said: “Over 1,400,000 people have been killed by guns since John Lennon was shot and killed on Dec 8, 1980.” She needed that to be put right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f666ab10569fa6709e49762d813c5e5acf09e79/0_162_4865_2919/master/4865.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb10ea66977093036cd3e9d3fd30c4e1 700w","title":"avoiding meat and dairy is single biggest way to reduce your impact on earth","story":" Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet, according to the scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet.“A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,” said Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the research. “It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car,” he said, as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions.“Agriculture is a sector that s all the multitude of environmental problems,” he said. “Really it is animal products that are responsible for so much of this. Avoiding consumption of animal products delivers far better environmental benefits than trying to purchase sustainable meat and dairy.”The analysis also revealed a huge variability between different ways of producing the same food. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land result in 12 times more greenhouse gases and use 50 times more land than those grazing rich natural pasture. But the comparison of beef with plant protein such as peas is stark, with even the lowest impact beef responsible for six times more greenhouse gases and 36 times more land. The large variability in environmental impact from different farms does present an opportunity for reducing the harm, Poore said, without needing the global population to become vegan. If the most harmful half of meat and dairy production was replaced by plant-based food, this still delivers about two-thirds of the benefits of getting rid of all meat and dairy production.Labels that reveal the impact of products would be a good start, so consumers could choose the least damaging options, he said, but subsidies for sustainable and healthy foods and taxes on meat and dairy will probably also be necessary. The new research has received strong praise from other food experts. Prof Gidon Eshel, at Bard College, US, said: “I was awestruck. It is really important, sound, ambitious, revealing and beautifully done.” He said previous work on quantifying farming’s impacts, including his own, had taken a top-down approach using national level data, but the new work used a bottom-up approach, with farm-by-farm data. “It is very reassuring to see they yield essentially the same results. But the new work has very many important details that are profoundly revealing.”Prof Tim Benton, at the University of Leeds, UK, said: “This is an immensely useful study. It brings together a huge amount of data and that makes its conclusions much more robust. The way we produce food, consume and waste food is unsustainable from a planetary perspective. Given the global obesity crisis, changing diets – eating less livestock produce and more vegetables and fruit – has the potential to make both us and the planet healthier.”Poore said: “The reason I started this project was to understand if there were sustainable animal producers out there. But I have stopped consuming animal products over the last four years of this project. These impacts are not necessary to sustain our current way of life. The question is how much can we reduce them and the answer is a lot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936ff2c32291263935d784420e37253a82d3c146/90_863_2085_1251/master/2085.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5df1f78adc62c6caaa5af5d8c8dad7f","title":"the new york pigeon in pictures andrew garn","story":"Andrew Garn is a native New Yorker who grew up surrounded by the city’s ubiquitous pigeons.

So modern!So, the point of what I am wearing today is that it looks like a dress, but it’s not a dress. It’s a co-ord, which means two matching soft-separate pieces that go together to make an outfit. By soft-separate, I mean a top and bottom in cotton, like this one, or silk or knit, not a tailored suit. And by matching, I\u0026nbspmean in the same colour andor print. (Black doesn’t count.) And, no, not a bikini.Is co-ord really a word? Well, Brexit wasn’t a word. Bromance wasn’t a word. Was quinoa a word before this decade? OK, maybe technically, but not one anyone used, so it hardly counts. And, no, we can’t call them matching soft-separates, because that sounds too 1970s regional department store. So co-ord is a word as of, well, now.A co-ord is cooler than a suit and sharper than a\u0026nbspdress. Matched pairs of things veer towards the twee – I\u0026nbspam thinking of twinsets, and shoes matched to handbags – but a\u0026nbspco-ord does the opposite. It’s as if you took your date dress and consciously uncoupled it. So modern! Also, at the risk of stating the eye-bleedingly obvious, you can wear the two halves… separately.I am a bit allergic to fanciful ideas about how to make clothes multitask, because most of them are idiotic. (“On holiday, why not wear your swimsuit to dinner? Just add a full-length ball skirt and diamonds!”) But even I can see that a\u0026nbspco-ord can be taken apart and put back together again. This shirt would work on holiday with denim shorts. And when the summer starts to end, the skirt can meet a rolltop sweater and ankle boots for a summer-to-autumn look.The co-ord is, as I mentioned, cool. So I\u0026nbspthink it’s fine that the type I am wearing here is the least hipster version. The more rock’n’roll end of the look is happening in festival fashion: a\u0026nbspstriped knitted bandeau top with matching pull-on miniskirt, or a\u0026nbspwhite denim bustier and matching shorts. There’s loads of that sort of thing around. If that’s your bag, you can accessorise your look with ironically ugly trainers and glitter makeup, and a bum bag worn slung over one shoulder, or whatever.For the rest of us, a pyjama suit, with silky trousers and a wrap or shirt jacket, is about as outre a version as is going to be wearable. (Zara has lots.) Or, a slick tracksuit, the kind you wear with a low heel instead of an ironically ugly trainer (I am obsessed with Ganni’s candy-pink version). It’s cool, it’s wearable, and you can put an outfit together in the dark. Game, set and matching.• Jess wears shirt, £29, and skirt, £36, both topshop.

He suddenly became a sweetheart for thousands around the world.Iran’s first-choice keeper for Russia 2018, Alireza Beiranvand, is not as handsome as Haghighi but his epic life story could be an inspiration for millions around the globe.Beiranvand was born in Sarabias, Lorestan, to a nomad family always on the move around the countryside to find grassland for their sheep. Alireza was the eldest child so it was normal that he worked from an early age to help them. His first job was shepherding and whenever he found free time he played football and Dal Paran, a local game, with his friends. Dal Paran involves throwing stones long distances you would not think that has much to do with football but years later it helped Beiranvand.When Beiranvand turned 12 his family settled in Sarabias and he trained with a local side. He started as a striker but when the goalkeeper got injured he stood between the sticks and a brilliant save was enough to keep him there. Beiranvand decided he would be a goalkeeper but his father strongly objected.Morteza Beiranvand thought, like many Iranian fathers, that football could not be a job and preferred Alireza to be a simple worker. “My father didn’t like football at all and he asked me to work,” Alireza told the . “He even tore my clothes and gloves and I played with bare hands several times.”The young goalkeeper decided to run away and went to Tehran in search of a chance at one the bigger clubs in the capital.He borrowed money from a relative and travelled to Tehran by bus. The “angel of success” was very quick to be kind to him – it was on the bus that he met a football coach, Hossein Feiz, who managed a local team. Feiz told Beiranvand that he would let him train in return for 200,000 Toman (£30). But the young keeper had neither money nor a place to sleep.He spent nights around Azadi Tower, where many poor migrants gathered. One night a young salesman offered Beiranvand a room at his home and the goalkeeper accepted, only to change his mind on his way there and walk back to the club where he trained on trial every day.“I slept by the club’s door and when I got up in the morning I noticed the coins that people had dropped for me,” he said. “They had thought I was a beggar! Well, I had a delicious breakfast for the first time in a long while.”Finally Feiz agreed to give Beiranvand an opportunity without him having to pay and asked the captain to support him. Beiranvand stayed at his colleague’s house for two weeks and then started working in a dressmaking factory owned by a father of another team-mate so he could sleep there at night.His next job was working in a car wash and, because of his height, he became a specialist at washing SUVs. One day, though, he found himself in a difficult situation. The Iran legend Ali Daei turned up to get his car cleaned and Beiranvand’s colleagues encouraged him to speak to the former Bayern Munich striker to see whether he would help him to progress his football career. Alireza didn’t take their advice. He preferred to find his way by himself. “I knew if I had talked to Mr Daei he would have surely helped me but I was ashamed to speak with him and tell him about my situation.”Soon after he met a Naft-e-Tehran coach and moved there. At first the club let him live in a prayer room but, after a while, they told him that he couldn’t sleep there any more. So he found a job in a pizza shop to have somewhere to stay at night. There, another challenging moment arose. His coach, who knew nothing about Beiranvand’s job, came to buy pizza. The goalkeeper did not want to see him but the shop owner forced him to serve and he left the shop a few days later.Finding another job to have a place to stay for the night was difficult and finally he accepted to work as a street cleaner. Sometimes he had to sweep a grand park alone and it was tough to stay fit for matches. Sacked by Naft because he trained with another team and got injured, he left for Homa but the manager there was reluctant to give him a contract. Beiranvand felt his dream was dying.Then the Naft under-23 manager called and told him that if he had not signed for another club, he could return. “Maybe it was fate that the Homa manager didn’t want to sign me,” Beiranvand said. “If I had remained in that team, maybe I would never have reached the level that I’m at today.”Beiranvand began to shine. He was selected for Iran’s under-23s and then became Naft’s first-team goalkeeper. But it was his childhood game Dal Paran that made him famous abroad in 2014. Throwing stones for several years enabled him to throw the ball much further than many other goalkeepers and his 70-metre assist against Tractor Sazi caught the eye of foreign media.In 2015 Alireza finally became Iran’s first-choice goalkeeper and, with 12 clean sheets in qualifying, he helped Team Melli cruise to Russia 2018. “I suffered many difficulties to make my dreams come true but I have no intention of forgetting them because they made me the person I am now,” he said.Now he has the chance to realise another dream: playing at a World Cup and perhaps moving to a European club. After all, for the nomad people, the journey never ends.Follow him here on Twitter.

Speaking at an event to promote to his book “A Brave New World” in Barcelona on Friday, Pochettino re-affirmed his commitment to his current club although appeared to keep the door open to a potential switch, depending on chairman Daniel Levy.He added: “I live in the present - there is nothing more important than that. I enjoy what is happening and what has to be will be. The link now with Madrid is normal and I take it with all normality. I’m committed to Spurs and still have a long contract with them I just signed.”Pochettino was then asked if he was “ready for a challenge like Real Madrid”, to which he responded: “Right now I am ready to go to lunch. I’m looking forward to going back to London.”The reporter subsequently asked if saying no to Madrid was impossible, with Pochettino stating: “For you maybe. Not for me.”He also paid tribute to Levy as the club prepares to move to their new stadium.He said: “I’m so happy and proud the faith Spurs and Levy have shown to me. That’s the most important thing for me. Today. What happened over the last day has increased expectations of the book release. But I’m happy.”The 46-year-old had earlier been ambiguous over his future, telling Spanish newspaper El Confidencial: “When Real Madrid call you, you have to listen to them. Although in this case it doesn’t depend on me. I have just signed a long contract with Tottenham and I am very happy here.“I am happy at Tottenham because they let me work and we are growing together. Right now I want to focus on planning for next season and keep out of all the things that are being said. There will be lots of rumours, lots of things said, but I have no news from Real Madrid.“I’m working very comfortably at Tottenham and it’s my obligation to focus on that. I do not want, nor can I, comment on Zidane going but what he has done is undoubtedly very big: no one has won three Champions Leagues in a row recently.”Tottenham insist there is no clause in Pochettino’s contract that allows him to leave, nor a verbal agreement that he can join Madrid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef93780b2d6a6b66fdcbcbc922a396d936b1e185/1127_359_879_527/master/879.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7706c415e7f173628063471e6bec54d8","title":"david squires on the story of world in motion","story":"Our resident cartoonist looks back on England teaming up with New Order for their finest World Cup musical hour"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/952b48c4fa20455b36343462a02bb0aa1457d5e6/3348_41_7734_4642/master/7734.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9021950458aeeee9d204778c01b22ba1","title":"how not to be a toddler for ever coco khan","story":"I’m part of the instant gratification generation, ruined by technology that delivers everything instantly I have many abiding memories of secondary school, but none as vivid as my science teacher, Mrs Chambers, writing in capital letters on the whiteboard a word: “toddler”. Every time you misbehaved, she’d take her oversized and slightly threatening long wooden ruler, and with a withering stare tap on the whiteboard. The message was clear. You are a toddler. You’re a toddler for speaking when she is talking, a toddler for not doing your work. It was a shrewd move because, at that age, nothing is as mortifying as an adult outing you as a child.“Toddlers have one thing in common,” she would say. “They cannot wait. They want everything now. You children need to learn to wait. Patience is a sign of maturity.”I often think about Mrs Chambers when I am considering smashing my laptop to smithereens because the loading icon has frozen, or hyperventilating because the Uber arrival time has jumped from three minutes to seven.I bet she doesn’t break into a cold sweat when she is told she needs to print rather than email a document. She probably has a printer at home, neatly tucked away on a shelf. She won’t have to wander around looking for a printer shop, increasingly desperate and dehydrated, like a desert drifter, tortured by mirages of printer shops that are in fact phone shops.What can I say? I’m part of the instant gratification generation, said to be ruined by technology that delivers everything instantly: messages, transport, dinner, information. We want results right now, an impulse that may be good for political change, but not for paper-based admin.But good things come to those who wait. Look at Mrs Chambers herself. One of the smartest women I knew at the time (I was a teenager, remember). Everything she learned she got from a book that she had to get from a library, presumably one she walked to, and which possibly didn’t have said book the first time. I imagine myself in that circumstance, the librarian explaining that I would have to wait, and would I like to reserve the book, and I am sure I would say, “Nah, I’ll just stay stupid, thanks.”But I am getting better. When I phone the doctor, I now stay on hold rather than slamming the phone down and thinking, “I’ll take my chances.” And I always give myself plenty of time in front of any iconic travel landmark to get the perfect Instagram photo.

The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6aaa40453971a568f1eb5b0a6f8bb1a4a44b631/677_48_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca53c016ae2db9c86cbe53a94e66857e","title":"jonathan bartley sian berry green party co leaders caroline lucas","story":"Current co-leader and former mayoral candidate join forces as Caroline Lucas steps downJonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, is to stand again for the post on a joint ticket with London assembly member Siân Berry after his current co-leader, Caroline Lucas, said this week she was stepping down.The announcement by Bartley and Berry has made them frontrunners for the role, which is voted on by Green members every two years. Bartley and Lucas were elected as joint leaders in 2016.Lucas, by far the party’s best-known figure and its only MP since she was elected to represent Brighton Pavilion in 2010, said on Wednesday “making space for other people” was the right thing to do.“We have a wonderful array of talent in the party and I would love the opportunity for more of that to be showcased,” Lucas said.Bartley, who was not well known before he stood with Lucas, is the leader of the Green opposition on Lambeth council in south London. Berry has a slightly higher profile, albeit largely in the capital. She is a Camden councillor and stood twice as the Greens’ candidate for London mayor.Lucas became the Greens’ first leader in 2008 after the party dropped its system of two “principal speakers”. She was replaced as leader by Natalie Bennett in 2012. Bennett endured a difficult 2015 general election, after which Lucas and Bartley took over.When Lucas and Bartley were elected joint leaders there was some scepticism as to how such an arrangement might work, but the pair say it has proved a success.Nominations for the leadership remain open this month and the winner will be announced at the party conference in October.Bartley said the Greens were “firmly established as England’s fourth party”. He said: “I want to continue that work with Siân as we build towards the next vital set of elections. “Our ambition is to have a Green on every council and together we believe the time is right for the party to step up to a whole new level.”Berry said that although Lucas was a hard act to follow, she was committed to growing the party’s support."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b14021407c9f153f27847c8f3e1e4396e6d038c/0_37_2819_1691/master/2819.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c45b0e193c96875b32809801791818a8","title":"justine greening tipped as tory candidate for london mayor","story":"MP for Putney’s chances have been boosted after rumoured rival Ed Vaizey ruled himself out Justine Greening has been tipped as the next Tory candidate for mayor of London, after one of her rumoured rivals said he would not run and endorsed the former education secretary.Greening, the MP for Putney, has not yet announced a bid to take on Labour’s Sadiq Khan for City Hall’s top job in 2020. However, her chances were boosted on Friday when former culture minister Ed Vaizey told the Huffington Post he had ruled himself out and was backing Greening. “I was never really planning to run,” he told the website.The Conservatives are due to begin the process of selecting their candidate in June, giving them a two-year campaign to unseat Khan, who is still likely to be the favourite in 2020.The timetable for the selection, according to ConservativeHome, will mean that nominations open this month, with a summer campaign culminating in a final vote in September. The Conservatives are understood to feel that Zac Goldsmith, who took on Khan in the 2016 election, wasn’t given enough time to establish his campaign, having only been selected in September before the vote in May. His campaign was also dogged by allegations of dog-whistle xenophobic tactics against Khan.Since leaving the cabinet in January, Greening, who was a vocal remain campaigner, has been outspoken about the need for the Tories to broaden their appeal to younger, socially liberal voters. Her majority was slashed at the last general election, from more than 10,000 to just 1,554. Labour are polling ahead in London, although the Conservatives have been buoyed by better than expected local election results, in which Labour failed to take target councils including Barnet and Wandsworth.Other candidates who have been tipped to run for Londonmayor include MEP Syed Kamall, who was defeated by Goldsmith to be the Tory candidate in 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b85eb23de5f7e7f1d3e467ff31bb2765004d895/0_62_4538_2723/master/4538.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=751ceb3961961dfd90d11677bbc46bb8","title":"inferred wasnt british tory members tell islamophobia","story":"Muslims in the party say their complaints over the issue have been brushed under the carpetWhen Ahmed (not his real name) joined the Conservative party six years ago, he thought it was a natural fit. “A lot of Muslims share conservative values,” he says. “I stood to be a councillor and there was talk of me going on to the party lists to become an MP.”He says he worked hard during election time, increasing the south Asian vote in his ward in Yorkshire. But a simple question about postal votes to the MP suddenly made him feel like he did not belong in the party. “I just asked a question,” he says. “In no way did I insinuate that I was going to do anything silly or illegal regarding postal votes. But his response was ‘This is the UK, sunshine’. It was really patronising – would he have said that to someone not of colour? He was inferring that I wasn’t British.”He then overheard other members talking disparagingly about another candidate of Pakistani heritage in a different ward. Not long after, he heard another party member say “the only good Muslims are Ahmadiyya Muslims”. “That’s like saying the only good Christians are the Coptics,” he says. “It’s insulting to all the others.”While he was not directly racially abused by other party members, seeing Islamophobic comments on local party Facebook groups was common, he says. “It wasn’t a nice experience in the party. Those in the right of the party you felt a sense of being looked down upon, they were patronising you. The whispers weren’t nice at all. But now those same members are very Islamophobic on their Facebook posts, now you see it quite openly.” A party member in the West Midlands says he made a complaint to the Conservatives’ regional headquarters, after an older councillor made a racist remark during a meeting. “It was totally brushed under the carpet they didn’t want to know,” he says. “They just said ‘don’t worry about it, he’s an old man’.”He contacted the Muslim Council of Britain after seeing other complaints about Islamophobia in the party. “When I saw the letter, I thought how refreshing – this is something that all Muslim Conservatives are feeling,” he says. “Only Muslims can feel Islamophobia and only black and ethnic people can feel racism – if you are not black or Asian you are not going to feel it. But they say to you ‘it’s nothing, it’s you, you’re reading too much into it’. But I can feel it, it’s how people look at you when you go to pray, or when you are fasting. It’s in how people talk to you.”When no action was taken over the member who used racist terminology, it made him feel like he was “on the outside”, he says. “My dad has been here for 60 years, but it makes me feel like we are back in the days of Enoch Powell it makes me feel like we haven’t moved on at all.”“It’s a problem throughout the party. It’s rampant because people don’t understand Islam. They think it’s a religion based on terrorism. We don’t think Isis are Muslims. They are a bunch of idiots, we believe they are terrorists like everyone else.”Another councillor did not want to be named because he believed it would be political suicide. “They’d put me under a bus for speaking about it,” he says. He feels his progress in the party has been blocked because of his religion. “It was fine in the local party until I showed some ambition,” he says.After he pushed to advance in the party, barriers suddenly appeared and he was made to feel like his face did not fit, he says. “They use terms like ‘the right sort of candidate’,” he says. “I sometimes wear a skull cap and people came to me and said that the local party leader had said that I looked too Muslim and I wouldn’t be accepted.”He says he has complained about the issue, but feels he cannot push it any further. “You mention Islamophobia and they run for the hills. The problem is too many people have too many friends in high places, so nothing is ever done about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af842b954c248c04da1811608c7196695a839406/0_259_5447_3269/master/5447.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b600004df70b8b71d9b91b0b61669723","title":"the derby horse by horse guide to the 239th epsom classic horse racing tips","story":"Twelve runners line up for British Flat racing’s most prestigious race and the big betting event of the meeting on SaturdayOrdinary pedigree and respectable form point to him being short of the necessary quality but this tough Mark Johnston-trained horse has a record of steady improvement. Won here in October and also at Goodwood last year, so undulating tracks hold no fears for him, and both those wins came on rain-softened ground, which he gets again. “Never nearer” third in a trial here in April, then kept on into second in the Chester Vase. No great surprise if he keeps plugging away for a place once more but makes little appeal for the outright win.Won a Leopardstown maiden on his debut in July but beaten all four starts since, albeit while showing promise. Comfortably held by Saxon Warrior when two and a half lengths behind him at Naas in September. Second in two long-established Derby trials this spring, notably when “never nearer” behind Hazapour at Leopardstown last time. Hardly showed lightning acceleration that day but this son of Galileo ought to appreciate the extra quarter-mile here. One of five for Aidan O’Brien.Product of the Aga Khan breeding that has sometimes done well here, including two years ago with Harzand, whose half-sister is this one’s mother. Won a Galway maiden on soft from three starts last year. Odds of 16-1 suggested little was expected when he reappeared in the Leopardstown trial last month but he travelled well, led when asked to do so and held off Delano Roosevelt and The Pentagon. Could improve again and an obvious contender, especially with Dettori booked to guide him through the race.Perhaps the least likely of Aidan O’Brien’s five, although such talk is dangerous after the trainer’s 50-1 winner 12 months ago. Won a Killarney maiden and a Newmarket Listed race, beating Dee Ex Bee, last year but trailed Saxon Warrior by three lengths at Naas. Looks short of pace and vulnerable once more.Sprang into contention when landing the Lingfield trial by daylight last month, when he took a keen hold, was allowed to stride on from an early stage and was never reeled in by his rivals, headed by Kew Gardens. The stated plan is to settle him behind a lead this time, though he looks a strong stayer and aggressive tactics could actually play well once more. Bred to do the job and any improvement for his reappearance run would make him dangerous.Godolphin runner was not quite good enough for Saxon Warrior in the Guineas, coming up short by a length and three-quarters and hard to think he can improve much on that form. Last five starts came at a mile and it’s not clear that an extra half-mile will help him, though his pedigree offers some hope. Needs the ground to dry up.Came closer than anything else has done to beating Saxon Warrior when held by just a neck at Doncaster in October, when he quickened to take the lead before being outbattled. Was two and a half lengths behind that rival when only fifth in the Guineas but excuses could be made and he was much more impressive when storming home in the Dante a fortnight later. Blistering speed he showed off a steady pace that day suggests an extra quarter-mile may not play to his strengths, especially on rain-softened ground. Looks a hard ride and has trouble keeping straight in the closing stages. Bundles of ability and a worthy second-favourite if the ground proves drier than expected.Unbeaten in four and unquestionably the right favourite, he is the only Group One winner in this field, having won two such races. Outbattled Roaring Lion at Doncaster in the autumn. Was thought to be vulnerable on his first start back and was not favourite when winning the Guineas, travelling smoothly and scoring with some authority. Any improvement on that would make him very hard to beat, short of trouble in running. Must prove his stamina for the extra half-mile, which can’t be taken for granted on his pedigree or his run-style. Draw in stall one is often a problem over this course and distance but he has the tactical pace to minimise that. Four stablemates will surely not be getting in his way. An immensely valuable stallion prospect if he can win this.Form and pedigree give this one plenty to prove and Dettori, who could have ridden, has gone for Hazapour instead. Beaten in both starts as a juvenile but had a wind operation in the winter and better this year though the bare form isn’t good enough.Another of O’Brien’s five, this one is starting to look exposed as not good enough after six starts. Won a Curragh maiden and a Group Three at Leopardstown but the most recent of those was in July. Neither the rain nor the extra distance are necessarily a help. Finished strongly to win the Chester Vase last month, having been brave to take a gap between rivals at the crucial moment. On the face of it, a half-length defeat of Dee Ex Bee is not enough to scare fans of Saxon Warrior and this colt may have plenty of running to do from the home turn, as he looked a bit short of early speed that day. But his stamina is not in question, the recent rain helps and he will surely be there to make a challenge if more fancied rivals falter.One of the best bred in the field but yet to show that level of class on the track. Has more to offer and the recent rain gives him a chance to outrun his big odds. To be ridden by Padraig Beggy, who sprang such a surprise in this race last year but has hardly had a winner since.

He must have played and missed five or six times already, and he’s only faced 20-odd balls. A quick single provides a bit of respite, and then Shadab slaps a wide ball up and over the cordon for four. After almost an hour of Branderson, it might be time for a bit of Coakes.“I think you’d find Woakes’ stats abroad would improve markedly if he was given the new ball,” says Mike Daniels. “Overseas generally is a hard place to bowl with a Kookaburra when the openers haven’t made inroads - as has generally been the case the last couple of years. When he’s given the new ball in ODIs overseas he’s penetrative - see his two Man of the Series awards in the winter. Judge him when he’s had the opportunity to set the tone rather than try to drag back the situation with an older knacker.”Yep, that’s fair. But even allowing for that point, his figures overseas are surprisingly crap.36th over: Pakistan 101-7 (Shadab 13, Amir 9) Amir may be a walking play-and-miss but Shadab is playing with soft-handed control and eases Broad through extra cover for four. Lovely shot.“England in taking wickets by bowling at the stumps shock!” weeps Andy Bradshaw.35th over: Pakistan 97-7 (Shadab 9, Amir 9) Amir is beaten again, this time by Anderson. It feels a like a matter of time before the eighth wicket falls, , just as it did when Sir Ian Botham and Graham Dilley were giving it some humpty on this ground 37 years ago.34th over: Pakistan 96-7 (Shadab 8, Amir 9) Amir swings and misses again at Broad, prompting an exchange of words and a smile from both players. Broad ends an excellent maiden by beating the outside edge again. He clearly fancies a five-for here it would be his first in a home Test since that surreal morning at Trent Bridge in 2015.33rd over: Pakistan 96-7 (Shadab 8, Amir 9) Amir slashes Anderson just wide of Buttler, leaping to his right at fifth slip. It would have been a comfortable catch for fourth slip, had he existed. Shadab then gets four cheap runs, flicking a loose delivery to fine leg.32nd over: Pakistan 88-7 (Shadab 2, Amir 8)  Amir is beaten by an absurd jaffa from Broad. I’m sure if Sarfraz would have bowled first if he knew how much the ball was going to swing. It’s 32 overs old and still doing plenty. Amir has sensibly decided to have a dart – he slices booming drive over gully for four. Then he is beaten by another superb delivery.“I’m looking forward to a big round of humble pie gobbling from everyone who was calling for Broad to be dropped earlier this week,” says Sam Jordison. “(Unless it was a clever tactic to get him on one...) Meanwhile, moving techno: Luke Slater - Love. Also, on the subject of Bicep, the video for Glue made me want to weep for my lost youth - for everyone’s lost youth. Moving techno is a beautiful thing.”31st over: Pakistan 83-7 (Shadab 1, Amir 4) Pakistan should declare and stick England in before the ball shuts up. Also: mind games. Amir gets off the mark with an absurd shot, chipping a big inswinger back over Anderson’s head for four.Faheem’s reprieve last two balls. He has fallen LBW to Anderson, plumb in front as he played around a nipbacker. A number of Pakistan batsmen have been dismissed playing across the line today.30th over: Pakistan 78-6 (Shadab 0, Faheem 0) Faheem is dropped off Broad! It was a simple chance to Malan at second slip - or it would have been, had Root not put him off by ing across from third slip. Ach. Broad has bowled brilliantly today.“That’s some incredible stats on Woakes,” says Guy Hornsby. “He’s basically Ars*nal last year, rampantly Wengery at home, staggeringly Brighton away. I know it’s not in vogue, but surely he’s as good an argument for squad rotation as anyone? Yes, he’s got to learn to play on wickets abroad, but if he’s half as effective away from home, then pick someone else until he’s stepped up. The problem being, of course, there’s few alternatives. Speaking of which, I hope Curran does well here, and not just because he’s a Surrey man. We need a good left-armer and he does seem to have a bit about him.”Don’t get me started on squad rotation. I’ve been boring people about it for so long that even my imaginary friends have started ostracising me.If England bowl properly this should be over pretty quickly. There goes another one: Salahuddin plays around a big inswinger from Broad and is given out LBW. He reviewed, as most debutants would, hoping it was swinging past leg stump. It wasn’t: replays showed it was hitting the leg bail and Salahuddin has gone.29th over: Pakistan 78-5 (Salahuddin 4, Shadab Khan 0) I bet there was a very small part of Anderson that begrudged himself that wicket, because it came from the kind of fuller delivery everyone has been telling him to bowl. Replays show that it moved quite sharply off the seam to hit the pad and deflect onto the stumps. At first I thought it had gone straight through him.“After the first 17 away Tests of his career James Anderson averaged 45 and looked without a clue as to how to bowl without conducive movement,” says Eamonn Maloney. “I don’t see Woakes ever getting the knack.”I suppose Anderson was younger at that stage. Weird thing with Woakes is that there’s no particular reason why he shouldn’t take wickets away from home – he’s often the fastest England bowler, he can swing the new ball, is very fit and has bowled well overseas in ODIs. For now, broadly speaking, I would use him at home and have him as back up for Anderson overseas.James Anderson gets his first wicket, slipping a full, straight delivery straight through Sarfraz. I don’t think the ball did much Sarfraz just played all around it.28th over: Pakistan 78-4 (Salahuddin 4, Sarfraz 14) Stuart Broad will bowl from the Nobody Ever Pays for a Pint Round Here, Ever End. He slips one wide to Sarfraz, who belts it through the covers for four with the minimum of fuss. He knows only one way, to counter-attack, and has raced to 14 from 12. It’s the way he plays!27th over: Pakistan 72-4 (Salahuddin 3, Sarfraz 9) James Anderson returns to the attack after lunch. He bowled a stubborn length before lunch, in more ways than one, though he hints at something a bit fuller in that over. One ball swings sharply back into Salahuddin, who smothers it with bat and pad. It’s worth updating those Chris Woakes statsHe’s an All-Time World XI in one country and Ilford 2nds in the rest.Lunchtime listening Who knew techno could be so moving?Thanks Nick, hello everyone. On the face of it, Every Loser Wins by EastEnders heart-throb Nick Berry is an epic meditation on the value of perseverance in the face of life’s vicissitudes. In fact, it’s a subtle comment on the quirky nature of Test cricket, and why sometimes it’s a good thing to lose the toss. The Ashes of 2005 and 2015 turned England’s way when they lost a toss at Edgbaston, and they benefitted from something similar at Headingley this morning.Pakistan didn’t necessarily make a mistake by batting first – as Nasser Hussain says on Sky, it was roughly a 50:50 call – but it’s easy to imagine the heap England might be in had they won the toss and batted first in tricky conditions. Instead, Stuart Broad and Blighty specialist Chris Woakes pitched the ball up and reduced Pakistan to 68 for four. England are back!(NB: They’re not actually back, but it’s been a good morning.)That’s it from me for the moment: Rob Smyth will take the first hour after lunch, then I’ll be back for the second bit of the afternoon. Direct your emails here until then. Having asked you to sign up for the Spin, we should probably give you a sample of what you’re signing up for. Here’s the latest edition, by Tanya Aldred. Strong morning for England, and despite suggestions that they should have more wickets by this point, I’d wager they would have whipped your arm off like a hungry shark if you’d offered them this at the start of play. Of the three bowlers only Curran has looked a bit innocuous, and we’ll let him off that for now as he’s not old enough to rent a car. 26th over: Pakistan 68-4 (Usman 3, Sarfraz 6) Sarfraz spends a decent amount of time complaining about movement behind the bowler’s arm, which brings up two thoughts: 1) is it really that distracting if someone shifts a little bit near the sight screen and 2) the players’ balconies are right above said sight screen - isn’t that going to cause a few problems? Anyway, Sarfraz settles himself enough to drive Broad through the covers for four, despite a despairing e from Curran, then flick another round the corner. And that’s lunch. 25th over: Pakistan 63-4 (Usman 3, Sarfraz 1) Skip’s in, and he gets off the mark straight away with a tuck off his hips. Good morning for England thus far. Another in what will probably be the last over before lunch would pop a little bow on it. Usman is off the mark, flicking a full straight one from Woakes off his toes for three just wide of mid-on. But then he loses his partner, Shafiq edging a terrific ball from Woakes - your classic off-stump away ducker - which Cook juggles but catches at first slip. 24th over: Pakistan 59-3 (Shafiq 27, Usman 0) The old man is back to show the young shaver how it’s done: Broad returns and beats Shafiq’s edge twice, but then sends down a slightly laboured bouncer which Shafiq jumps all over, pulling just in front of mid-wicket and collects four. 23rd over: Pakistan 55-3 (Shafiq 23, Usman 0) Whoosh. Peach of a lifter from Woakes tickles Usman’s nose: there was a noise there, although there wasn’t really an appeal from bowler or keeper...and snicko suggests there was a tickle on the fingertip as it went through. Technically an opportunity missed for England, but it was such a small sound it seemed more like a flick of the shirt or something22nd over: Pakistan 53-3 (Shafiq 22, Usman 0) Usman Salahuddin is the new man in, making his Test debut in what is also his 100th first class game, seven years after making his international bow. He watches from the other end as Shafiq blocks out most of an over from Curran, then plays a nice carve for four through gully. 21st over: Pakistan 49-3 (Shafiq 18, Usman 0) Wicket at a good time for England: those two batsmen were looking settled. Haris had been looking good until then, playing a nothing shot to a ball on a decent line from Woakes, hanging his willow out there (as it were), catching the edge through to Malan at second slipper, where he takes a good low one. 20th over: Pakistan 46-2 (Haris 26, Shafiq 17) Good fielding from Buttler, chasing down a Haris push towards the ropes off Curran to save a run. They merely take three: at those points fielders must have some existential questions for themselves, wondering what on earth they’re doing with their lives, throwing themselves around like loons for the sake of a single. 19th over: Pakistan 42-2 (Haris 23, Shafiq 16) Woakes has an appeal of his own, otherwise a fairly uneventful over. Tom Bowtell has been at the stats again. “Lovely to see Broad getting it to spit past the edge like old times. He’s currently 31 years and 342 days. Since he was that age, Jimmy has taken 180 wickets at 21.42, so there could be life in those ludicrously long legs yet...”18th over: Pakistan 42-2 (Haris 23, Shafiq 16) For a cruel tiny moment, Curran thought he had snuck through Shafiq’s defences, but like a child having an ice cream whipped away from him, a pesky bat got in the way. Broad then comes over to offer some advice, and Curran does a decent enough job of looking respectful, but also like he wants to tell the old boy to eff off. Haris times a push rather nicely just in front of point for a couple, then Curran has a big lbw shout, but it looked high and they don’t review on that basis. Decent pace though. 17th over: Pakistan 39-2 (Haris 21, Shafiq 15) Woakes goes across Haris, and Bairstow - but only Bairstow - screams for a caught behind. There was a noise but it was probably a hint of thigh. Decent enough over. 16th over: Pakistan 38-2 (Haris 21, Shafiq 14) And here is Curran. My colleague Rob Smyth, who’ll be on after lunch, sends me this list of teenagers who’ve played for England: 16 Test wickets taken by the under-20s. Curran goes full to Haris, with a hint of swing, but by the third over the batsman seems to have got it sussed: he drives once through the covers for two, then for a second time for four, holding the pose and showing off his excellent form, like a gymnast sticking their arms out to display they’ve nailed the landing. 15th over: Pakistan 32-2 (Haris 15, Shafiq 14) It’s Chris Woakes first change rather than Curran, replacing Anderson. Woakes sends down the loosener’s loosener which Shafiq plays a slightly odd shot at, a cut off his tip-toes that goes over the covers and to the ropes. Next is a much more convincing shot, from a over-compensating half-volley, Shafiq driving splendidly to pretty much the same spot on the boundary. The rest of the over is better, beating the bat a couple of times, including a big flash that Shafiq misses. As they have a drink, here’s John Starbuck:“I just caught TMS discussing Broad’s run-up, but I noticed myself that it now seems to be a few stutters, then 16 full paces. This is much longer than he used to do, which is a bit odd, as you’d imagine an older bowler would shorten it. It probably means he won’t be able to bowl quite so many overs, but if it means he gets more wickets, as he’s doing so far, perhaps that won’t matter too much. I recall lots of fast bowlers (West Indies and Australia mainly) in the old days would start from somewhere near the boundary. Presumably it helps to steady their accuracy in some way, or maybe just to irritate the batters?”14th over: Pakistan 24-2 (Haris 15, Shafiq 6) Broad in again, sticks one down leg side then bowls the most perfect leg cutter, starting on middle-off and moving away. The sort of ball that Shafiq just had to stick his bat down, close his eyes and pray he didn’t nick it. After Shafiq gets away from strike, Broad repeats the trick to Haris. Great bowling.

Dzumhur even had a match point, but it’s now 5-5. 1-1 in sets! Djokovic shattered his racquet in rage after a potential winner smashed into the net. Bautista Agut held his nerve to win the tie-break 8-6. Djok is seething with the gods, but mostly himself and will get a warning for his conduct. Bautista Agut arrives at two set points, with Djokovic again scrabbling and groaning around the court. An ace gets him there, though the first is blown, and then Djokovic levels it with his own ace. 6-6 in the tie break. Djokovic and Bautista Agut are into a tie-break in the second set.Separating Dzhumur and Zverev is going to be tough, and probably a long old process.. The Bosnian surged ahead of his German rival and had game point. He then missed that, and faced a break point which he rode out with a sweeping pass beyond a scrabbling Zverev before then securing the game. 5-4 in the final set. Will Zverev be so solid on his serve? Djokovic breaks Bautista Agut after a deuce and will serve out the second set. Dzumhur breaks back and to love! Zverev looked as if he had given up the ghost on his serve. 4-4 in the deciding set. France’s Gilles Simon is close to the edge himself here, having lost the first two sets to Kei Nishikori. At 2-2, it’s going with serve in third. Dzumhur takes Zverev to deuce but the second seed holds his serve for 4-2. Having been close to disaster in that fourth set, he is nearing victory. Set point saved! Bautista Agut is a powerful opponent and making Djokovic make plenty of slides across the court. A break and set point is forced on his opponent’s serve with a magical, thrashing winner. Djokovic attempts another, but is wide of the line when the second set beckoned. A reluctance to come forward is giving Bautista Agut chance to stay in points and he levels at 5-5. Zverev took that last service game to go 3-1 up, his winning shot greeted by some racquet abuse from Dzhumhur, but the Bosnian held his nerve unexpectedly to serve out the next game. It’s 3-2 at the moment. The Djokovic match just got a bit more interesting. He’s been broken back by Bautista Agut and it’s at 5-4, with the Argentine to serve. Afternoon, all. John Brewin here, stepping in for Simon as heads for a much deserved pitcher of Pimm’s. I’ll be sipping Robinson’s Barley Water. And then he’s broken to love! This is just wild inconsistency from Dzumhur, who can’t decide whether he’s brilliant or useless but seems to be edging towards the latter conclusion.And then he breaks back! Another remarkable swing in fortunes, as Dzumhur ends a prolonged exchange of crosscourt backhands with a powerful forehand down the line to make it 1-1 in the fifth against Zverev!Dzumhur’s funk looks like it might be terminal – he’s been broken by Zverev in the first game of the decider.On Court One the 30-year-old Romanian Mihaela Buzarnescu, who ended 2014 with a ranking of 891 and has very gradually worked her way upwards, breaking into the top 100 for the first time last year, is leading Elina Svitolina 3-2 – with a break – in the first set. This is already the best ever Grand Slam performance for both players, so they’re both in uncharted territory.Kei Nishikori is making short work of Gilles Simon: He won the first set 6-3 and is now 3-0 up in the second with two breaks of serve in the bank.Alex Zverev levels the match at two sets apiece! Damir Dzumhur’s game just fell apart there, with victory in his grasp. Between coming out to serve for victory and sitting down at two sets apiece he won only three points, all of them in the tiebreak. Into a decider we go.Somehow Dzumhur has got to pick himself up after that disappointment, as he’s still but a tiebreak away from victory.Djokovic has now won four games on the spin, taking a 2-0 lead in the second set against Bautitsta Agut. Meanwhile Dzumhur’s attempt to serve for the match against Zverev didn’t go well – he’s just been broken to love!Damir Dzumhur breaks again and will serve for the match against Alex Zverev! Zverev saved a succession of break points in his last two service games, a couple more in this one, but eventually gave it up with a double fault.Yulia Putintseva, the Kazakhstani world No98 and first-set conquerer of Johanna Konta, is in round four after beating Qiang Wang 1-6, 7-5, 6-4. Putintseva was a quarter-finalist here two years ago, by a distance the finest Grand Slam performance of her career. She will play the winner of the match that has followed them on Court 7, between Katerina Siniakova and Barbora Strycova, the 26th seed. That match has only just begun, Siniakova breaking serve in the opening game.While Zverev ended up winning five points on the spin to take that game, and instead of serving for the match Damir Dzumhur is serving to stay in the fourth set.Djokovic wins the first set! He breaks in what turns out to be the final game of a high-quality opener to snatch it 6-4.… and it’s back to deuce, the third break point saved with a strong serve out wide followed by a lovely, heavily-spinning drop shot down the line.Seeds in big trouble dept: Crunch time for Alex Zverev, who is 2-1 down in sets, 4-4 in games and 0-40 in points against Dzumhur.The 34-year-old Spaniard and 30th seed knocks out the No4 seed in straight sets to march into round four. It’s a stage he has reached six times before, and he has lost every time. This year he’ll play either Djokovic or Bautista Agut. Match point on Court No1, where Verdasco has a break point against Dimitrov …The match between Djokovic and Bautista Agut has started extremely promisingly, with both players reaching a high level from the start. Djokovic just had, and missed, the match’s first break point, trading a lengthy succession of cross-court groundstrokes before attempting a drop shot that dropped into the net. It’s 4-4 in the first set.On Court 18 Kei Nishikori has made a storming start against Gilles Simon, but the Frenchman has just saved three break points to go from 0-40 down, win five successive points and his first game of the match. Still, he trails 1-3.Drama on Court One, where Fernando Verdasco – already two sets up – broke the fourth seed, Grigor Dimitrov, to go 4-3 up in the third set. But while I was composing this update he was broken back again. So, as you were.Drama on Philippe Chatrier, where a ball is scooped up into the air and both Dzumhur and a ball boy run to catch it. Both are too busy looking up to see each other coming the player gets there first, the ball boy runs into him and falls down, hurt. Eventually he gets up and stumbles groggily down the tunnel, leading to a brief delay while a replacement is found.Damir Dzumhur wins the third set against Alex Zverev 6-4, clinching it with an excellent rally in which he was dragged to the net and worked his opponent around the court with a series of finely angled but not quite clinical volleys, before finally putting one away.Seeds in trouble dept (2): Alex Zverev, the No2 seed, stormed through his first set against Damir Dzumhur 6-2 but then lost the second and is a break down in the third: Dzumhur is serving for it at 5-4.Seeds in trouble dept: Grigor Dimitrov, the No4 seed, is two sets down against Fernando Verdasco. He lost the first on a tie break and seriously wobbled in the second – nearly half of Verdasco’s points came from his opponent’s unforced errors.The 21-year-old 14th seed has come through this one and is in the last 16 of a Grand Slam for the second time, after last year’s US Open. Sakkari actually hit more winners than Kasatkina, but her serve while fast was too wildly unreliable to be a genuine weapon.Next up on Suzanne Lenglen: Novak Djokovic against Roberto Bautista Agut. They have played seven times, with Djokovic holding a 6-1 head-to-head advantage, including victory here two years ago, in four sets.Keys sets up a second match point with another winner, and this one is surrendered by Osaka with a double fault. And this is what Keys has to say about it:Naomi raised her level a lot in the second set and I really just had to hang in there. Clay is growing on me. It’s not my favourite still but being in the round of 16 for a second time definitely makes it a little bit better.From 1-4 down Keys draws level, hitting two fabulous winners, one down the line and the other crosscourt. It’s an oddly compelling spectacle, this, Keys’ racket like Forrest Gump’s box of chocolates – you never know what you’re going to get.Osaka has taken Keys to a second-set tie break, and has won the first two points. The American should already be back in the locker room resting up for round four, but is making life very difficult for herself. Osaka’s tactics are simply to keep the ball in play and wait for an error, and they’re working surprisingly frequently. On court seven Yulia Putintseva, who beat Johanna Konta in the first round, is playing Qiang Wang, who beat Venus Williams at the same stage. Wang won the first set 6-1, but it’s deadlocked at 4-4 in the second.Over on Philippe Chatrier Damir Dzumhur, who at 26 has never been beyond the third round of a Grand Slam, has levelled the match against Alexander Zverev, winning the second set 6-3.Keys from 15-30 down, has a match point, misses it and then surrenders the game, hitting a forehand well long on break point. This is a strange match, with Keys clearly the superior player but also making too many unnecessary errors. Osaka has hit seven winners in the entire match, to Keys’ 18, but is still hanging in there.Keys held her serve and has just broken, so is now serving for the match at 5-4 in the second set.So, an update on what has happened in the first hour of play:On Philippe Chatrier, Alexander Zverev is a set up against Damir Dzumhur, and 3-3 in the second. On Suzanne Lenglen, Madison Keys won the first set against Naomi Osaka 6-1 but is having to fight in the second, which is currently on serve with Osaka 4-3 up. On Court One, Grigor Dimitrov is in a battle against Fernando Verdasco, who is currently serving at 5-6 in the first.So here’s a Reuters preview of today’s action, with the order of play on the main courts:Second seed Alexander Zverev will resume his quest for a maiden Grand Slam title against Bosnian Damir Dzumhur in the third round of the French Open on Friday.The German has never reached the last 16 at Roland Garros and has lost his only other meeting with Dzumhur - in the quarter-finals of last year’s Shenzhen Open. Former champion Novak Djokovic faces a stern test against Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut, the 13th seed, especially as the Serb has been far from his clinical best so far. Seventh seed Dominic Thiem, the only player to beat favourite Rafael Nadal on clay this season, plays Italian Matteo Berrettini in the Bullring in one of the day’s last matches. In the women’s draw, second seed Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark takes on France’s Pauline Parmentier for a place in the fourth round. Wozniacki demolished Spaniard Georgina Garcia Perez 6-1 6-0 to reach round three and while she has a 3-1 head-to-head lead over Parmentier, the Dane was beaten by the Frenchwoman in Istanbul on clay earlier this year. U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens is also in action, the 10th seed taking on Italy’s Camila Giorgi, while fellow American Madison Keys meets talented Japanese youngster Naomi Osaka. Order of play on the main showcourts (all matches second round unless stated, prefix numbers denote seeding): Simon will be here shortly. In the meantime you can read Kevin Mitchell’s account of Maria Sharapova’s progress, in which he describes the Russian as “flowing through Roland Garros with the determined air of a queen not quite ready for the guillotine”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/755f9fcfbe85a04556df5aff220846db8beb7052/938_1063_3005_1803/master/3005.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e3004ba15dbcd43ac1aeb0fdf3f6c49","title":"stuart laws funniest things","story":"The standup comic on the things that make him laugh the mostHarry Hill’s 2005 tour preview at a 100-seater venue in Windsor.

For the third time in four years, Top Gear has found itself without its lead host. If you’re feeling optimistic, at least you can say that Matt LeBlanc resigned in a largely professional way.At least it was delivered through the proper channels, and sounded grateful. Given the way the last two Top Gear hosts ducked out – Chris Evans tweeted his resignation under a swirl of low ratings and digs from the tabloids, and Jeremy Clarkson effectively punched his way to a sacking – LeBlanc’s exit is a Debrett’s level masterclass in etiquette.In fairness to LeBlanc, his stay was never likely to be a long one. His appointment had the ring of novelty, like the BBC was overstretching to show that it still has muscle. Here was a legitimately famous man – admittedly most famous for a 20-year-old television programme, but still – who lives in America and spends six months of every year earning $4m a season on his CBS sitcom, Man With a Plan. Was he ever going to give that up in order to interview Jason Manford in an abandoned paint factory in Dunsfold? Would you? Of course you wouldn’t. But let’s not focus too hard on the exit. Let’s focus on the hole that has been left behind. Losing so many hosts in such a short time is not ideal. The appeal of Top Gear was that it always looked more fun to make than to watch. So if the people who make it can’t be bothered any more, then why should we?As far as I can tell, the BBC now has four options. The first is to replace LeBlanc with another celebrity. Maybe it can lure in Adam Sandler or Vin Diesel or Jay Leno with the promise of driving around the Alps in a supercar a few times a year. Maybe it will. But I’d argue that it shouldn’t. Big American stars are flighty and expensive, and they wouldn’t necessarily enjoy the grunt-work of putting together a weekly magazine show for BBC Two. Or maybe Top Gear could introduce a rotating panel of big-name guest hosts. But, again, I wouldn’t recommend this option. This is partly because star quality is never what the show has been about. Some of the filmed segments might enjoy a bit of razzle-dazzle, but it is always juxtaposed with the slapdash make-do-and-mend nature of the studio segments. The heart of Top Gear isn’t the car reviews, it’s the knowledge that the everyone on camera has just been drinking crap tea from a polystyrene cup while hiding from drizzle in a caravan. Sacrificing that for a succession of tentpole names would be a mistake. Also, Have I Got News For You has guests hosts, and Have I Got News For You is terrible.Alternatively, they could just let the existing hosts get on with it. Over the past couple of years, Chris Harris and Rory Reid have developed a nice little chemistry of their own, with Harris as the bone-deep car nerd and Reid as the excitable child. Perhaps they have what it takes to shoulder the series alone? After all, don’t forget that it took a few years for Clarkson, Hammond and May to properly bed in. The BBC has always been much better at developing talent than shipping it in, so it would make sense to just hand Top Gear to them to see what happens. Sure, it might not initially be the ratings smash of old, but the pair could take their time and build it back into something that fits their respective skillsets. The result of this would be a newer, better, more authentic Top Gear that might well regain some of the show’s former glory.Or they could just ditch it altogether. Top Gear has become a liability, so they could just bin it and move on. In fact, yes, let’s just go with that one. Great. Decision made. Thanks Top Gear. The door’s that way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9942f103d2d1713034a7b78ca27d3a79f7fa044/0_31_7398_4438/master/7398.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721317b7c231ef0208dde4e3fef8e675","title":"broadway new york book times square delirious street tour","story":"This is the street that drove America forward – the path of progress as it expanded, powered by showmanship and illusionA clutch of bedraggled fancy dress characters lie in wait for visitors to Times Square on a late weekday morning, hustling for tourist dollars in return for a souvenir picture.Superheroes and Muppets compete with a collective of Disney mice, a topless woman wearing a red, white and blue feathered headdress, and her slightly more modestly-dressed friend, who has added a patriotic bra and the letters N and Y in white greasepaint on her butt.A bronze statue of George M Cohan, the impresario-songwriter who wrote “Give my regards to Broadway” stares past them down the long stretch of possibly the most famous street in the world, beyond an eight-story neon altar to advertising, toward the improbably slender Flatiron building, 23 blocks south.Here is modern Broadway at the most grimly commercial point of its 13-mile journey, slicing along the length of Manhattan. Where, a century earlier, the deluxe Rector’s restaurant once prepared lobster “sixteen different ways at a dollar apiece”, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co now serves its seafood to New York’s visitors with a “boat size bucket of fries” on the side.The Great White Way – nicknamed in the early 1900s for its dazzling electric lights – feels dispiriting here at its epicentre in the raw light of day. Fran Leadon, the author of a new history of the street that tells the story of modern America, almost visibly recoils from a fancy dress Batman as we pick through the aimless herd.Broadway is still global shorthand for bright lights, big city – and even though modern Times Square is underwhelming by day, it is a garish explosion at night. Right now, global stars including Bruce Springsteen, Denzel Washington and Glenda Jackson compete with musical revivals of My Fair Lady, Carousel and Hello Dolly! as well as a newly-arrived Harry Potter extravaganza.The spectacle is gaudy, but sits well in the tradition of the theatre district, which Leadon writes in Broadway A History of New York City in Thirteen Miles always provided a “delirious exaggeration of American culture”. This is the street that drove America forward – the Path of Progress as it expanded north, powered by showmanship and illusion.“There is a mythology about Broadway that we take for granted,” Leadon says. “The Great White Way, the crossroads of the world, the theatres, ticker tape parades, all these public displays. I had always thought that mythology came from the street, from all the things that were there and the things that had happened there.“I think what I have concluded is that it was the opposite – which is much more interesting – this community, especially of business types, kind of invested in this mythology. They wanted the street in New York, in the country, to be powerful, to be magical, to be creative, and everything that followed was fulfilling that desire to have it be this mythical place.”Starting at the southern tip of Manhattan, like the island’s spine, Broadway has held the city together and sometimes been its fault line. It has witnessed riots, police beating crowds of protestors, the symbolic downfall of a colonial monarch and the rise of the first US president.Wild, brawling men and outrageous, over-inflated showmen have been venerated there, office workers have greeted presidents, war heroes, sports stars and astronauts with signature ticker tape parades.“From the beginning, it was the economic engine of the city, it was the thing that was pointing the way towards the city’s development,” Leadon said. “Broadway was always the place where things happened first: the first theatre the first really big hotel all the main churches. It was originally where all the big mansions were, downtown. It was always the big incubator for the city.”The 80-feet wide muddy, early 17th century route to drive livestock through the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam was named Brede Wegh – Broad Way – and when the British took over, it was Anglicised and conjoined to become Broadway.It remained a filthy mess, hogs foraging in the street, Caribbean pirates in the taverns. Less than a mile long, and, from an early stage, a physical expression of inequality – the east side developed by artisans and tradesmen was known as the shilling side, and the west, owned by Trinity Church, was the wealthy dollar side.“Since it was the main gathering place in the city, it was where everything came together, so the wealthiest people in the country, but also the poorest and the native born, old Dutch families, but also the newer immigrants, slave-owner and slave,” Leadon said. “It’s always been representative of this gap between wealth and destitution and as the city developed, it just got wider and wider and wider, but it was there from the very beginning.”The panic of 1837, a financial crisis which triggered recession, led to crowds of destitute men and women lining up for bread and firewood. Today, the midtown stretch is still a haven for homeless people, slumped on sidewalks and public squares.Broadway charts the American story. When General George Washington sailed into New York in 1776, he took over an almost abandoned city after British forces fled. After the first copies of the Declaration of Independence reached New York, on the night of 9 July, Washington read it aloud to his troops, who rushed down Broadway to Bowling Green. “Ropes were thrown around the gilded statue of George III and, following a series of hopeful cracking noises, king and horse hit the ground.” The statue was hacked up and its lead melted down to make bullets to use against the British redcoats.In 1790, as the first president of the United States, Washington briefly moved into 39-41 Broadway, but by the time Government House was finished, in 1791, New York had lost the capital to Philadelphia.Fears of inferiority drove progress and sent Broadway extending north, in spite of the hard-to-tame marshlands, eventually erted underneath modern day Canal Street. Leadon said the idea was: “ ‘If we spruce up the city a little bit, maybe we can look like Philadelphia … we need better architecture to start to compete with Philly and Boston and become the main American metropolis’.”Money and grand homes shifted north, fashionable stores followed, offices and hotels came in behind and pushed the theatres north, too.By the time AT Stewart \u0026amp Co opened a “marble palace” of a dry goods store in the 1840s, Broadway had seized commercial dominance as the place to get the first pick of Paris fashions arriving by ship from Europe. Shopping and promenading became a cultural phenomenon.The visiting Charles Dickens arrived on Broadway and was dazzled, writing: “We have seen more colours in ten minutes, than we should have elsewhere is as many days. What various parasols! What rainbow silks and satins!”The 1850s brought a hotel boom – the St Nicholas was celebrated as the largest and most elegant in the world – but the fashionable advance was also accompanied by prostitution, and violent gangs who fought epic battles. William Poole, immortalised as Bill the Butcher – champion boxer, butcher, rightwing anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant politician – died a lingering death after he was shot in a hotel bar brawl. Broadway drew crowds of 100,000 to see an open hearse drawn by four white horses, cloaked in black, with white plumes on their heads lead a procession of 4,000 people to his Brooklyn burial ground.By the 1870s Central Park was nearing completion – built as a haven from noise and overcrowding, an answer to the great green spaces of European cities, such as London’s Hyde Park. And Broadway took off north again – the sixth and seventh miles up to 106th Street becoming more like a wide European boulevard. “By then,” Leadon said of the expanding metropolis, “they are thinking, ‘we need to look like Paris, we need to compete with the European cities’... Philadelphia was long ago vanquished and they were trying to compete with London and Paris.”Electric light arrived in 1880, and the first electric billboard in 1892, at the site where the Flatiron would spring up a decade later. Probably the most audacious early ad was at 38th Street in 1910 – 72ft high and 90ft wide and “inspired by the long-running Broadway hit Ben-Hur, featured a moving chariot race complete with galloping horses and cracking whips, animated by an ingenious sequencing of 20,000 incandescent bulbs that flashed on and off 2,500 times a minute.”The most enduring, unique landmark to Broadway’s heyday, built in 1902, still stands today, like an ocean-going liner at the narrow point where Broadway meets Fifth Avenue at 23rd Street. The ‘freak building’ as it was described, better known as the Flatiron, was a futuristic skyscraper, built from steel, clad in limestone, brick and terracotta tiles. It was modelled after the giant American Imperialism structures of the Chicago World’s Fair, but madly compromised by its sharply triangular plot. It became known as hurricane corner as winds played havoc with hats and women’s hemlines. Cops arrested men who gathered to gawp, and a magistrate ruled in the case of a French tourist, that “two minutes is a reasonable time ... and you can use your eyes but at the end of that time you must move on”.By miles 12 and 13, Leadon says, “the past is a little closer to the surface”. Farmland was not really developed until the subway got there in the early 20th century Inwood Hill Park at the top of Manhattan still has overgrown foundations of old ‘Gilded Age” mansions in the woods. John F Seaman’s 19th century marble house had 25 rooms, an observatory and a swimming pool. The entry gatehouse was a scaled down Arc de Triomphe. “Today almost nothing is left,” he writes, but “tucked behind an auto body shop on the west side of the street between 215th and 218th streets, Seaman’s Arc de Triomphe still peers out at the street, covered with graffiti and gradually succumbing to the weight of time”.Today, the pattern of flatten and replace goes on. As he walked north from Flatiron, Leadon gasped as he reached 28th Street and saw another building being razed. “That’s the last vestige of the old Broadway of the 70s and 80s, marginal discount stores full of trinkets, wig stores buying and selling human hair. Weird, weird stuff.”He sounds regretful, almost as if a tiny part of his book is already out of date. But as he records, on Broadway it was always this way money drives everything forward. As journalist Junius Henri Brown put it in 1868: “Broadway is always being built, but it is never finished.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11f7291e49ce6f6c1987ce901d988b0911094683/0_173_6581_3948/master/6581.jpg?w=645\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d32073b97fdba15000e7417a26f5b62b 1290w","title":"how chopping off their horns helps save rhinos from poachers","story":"Violent but bloodless, dehorning is considered a necessary evil by anti-poaching campaigners in South AfricaArmed with a dart gun in a helicopter hovering above Somkhanda game reserve in South Africa, the vet Dr Mike Toft has just shot a powerful cocktail of drugs into the massive white rhino below.The 2,000kg (315st) bull starts to stagger and sinks slowly to its knees as the drugs take effect. Though immobilised, the rhino is conscious. So, once it has been moved into the right position by a team on the ground, foam earmuffs and a blindfold are placed on its head to reduce stress levels.After marking the ideal cutting point to avoid damaging the living growth plates at the base of the horns, Toft fires up a chainsaw and slices both of them off.Those magnificent horns, which have helped to protect this species for millions of years, are the reason that more than 7,000 rhinos have been killed in South Africa in the past decade. A persistent human desire for rhino horn – for everything from traditional medicine to hangover cures or status symbols – drives the slaughter of more than 1,000 of the animals each year in the country that has the largest rhino population in the world.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theWorldwide, the situation is grave. The northern white rhino became functionally extinct after the death of Sudan, the last male, in March, while the black rhino population is down to about 5,200. The situation for Asian rhinos is equally bleak: there are just 3,200 surviving Indian rhinos, about 76 Sumatran rhinos and 60 Javan rhinos. There are fewer than 30,000 rhinos globally, with Africa’s southern white rhino the most populous species at about 20,000.These alarming figures have driven wildlife managers in several South African reserves to take the drastic step of sawing off hundreds of horns every year, before criminal syndicates can get their hands on them. With the poachers’ prize removed, the risk to the hornless animals is greatly reduced.Toft has removed close to 1,800 horns from 900 rhinos in the past three years in KwaZulu-Natal, which has been heavily targeted by poachers. Both Galliers and Toft acknowledge that dehorning is not a permanent or ideal solution to the crisis. “This is not something we want to do. It’s expensive and invasive but we believe it is a necessary evil,” says Galliers, noting that it costs about £580 to safely dehorn a rhino.The cost is based on the hiring of helicopters and skilled vets. Galliers, also head of the anti-poaching initiative Project Rhino, points out that dehorning must be repeated every 18-24 months as the horns regrow naturally.Even then, there have been cases of dehorned animals being shot for their stumps. Toft has developed a method of removing as much horn as possible without causing pain to the rhino or damage to its growth plates. The horn is removed to about three finger widths from the base, then the stump is further trimmed around the edges with an angle grinder, enabling the removal of an extra 2kg of horn on a large bull.The operation is noisy and violent, but there is no blood – and Toft insists it is no more painful than trimming your fingernails if done correctly.Galliers and Toft believe dehorning could help save rhinos under threat elsewhere in Africa and Asia. But the cost means that might only be possible in small and medium-sized reserves. Dehorning only selected bulls is not an option, as those without horns would be more vulnerable in territory fights. In parks where the entire rhino population is dehorned, all bulls are placed at equal disadvantage. But dehorned rhinos can still fend off lions by using their considerable bulk as a weapon, Toft says. For trophy hunters, the aim is to acquire both the head and the horns. Many other horned animals are hunted: elephants are slaughtered for their ivory, but Toft does not think detusking is a solution. Tusks are partially hollow and contain sensitive roots and nerves. Although it would be feasible to remove the solid portion, a large volume of tusk would have to remain intact, which could still attract the attention of poachers. Tusks are also essential tools for elephants to strip tree bark or dig up succulent roots and tubers.For now, dehorning appears to be achieving success as an emergency measure, buying time while the decades-old debate continues about how to end the demand for rhino horn.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The relatively unknown law professor met Mattarella late on Thursday night to put forward a list of ministers, which the president has accepted.“All the conditions have been fulfilled for a political, Five Star and League government,” said Luigi Di Maio, the Five Star chief, and Matteo Salvini, the League leader, in a joint statement after a day of talks in Rome.The deal will bring at least temporary calm to a political crisis that has embroiled Italy for weeks. The tumult raised questions – in Brussels and among investors around the world – about whether the rise in Italian populism and the collapse of traditional parties posed a fundamental threat to the country’s future in the eurozone.The formation of the new government will at least temporarily allay those concerns, because it will remove for now the threat that snap elections will be called later this summer, a prospect which worried investors because it could have bolstered support for anti-EU parties.The populist leaders stepped back from their insistence that Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old Eurosceptic, should serve as finance minister. The choice had been vetoed by Mattarella, prompting the M5S and the League to call off their deal. Savona will now serve as EU minister instead.But there are still many unknowns about how the new administration – an uneasy alliance between two former political opponents, both jockeying for power – will govern Italy.Salvini, the bombastic and xenophobic leader of the League , who rose in recent years on the back of incendiary and racist statements about migrants and Roma, will take on the role of interior minister. Salvini has campaigned on the promise of mass deportations of migrants and said a new government would build detention centres around Italy. He is also a fierce critic of Brussels and has called for closer ties to Russia.Di Maio will take on a powerful new post that will combine labour and industry portfolios in a move that could mark big changes to labour and environmental policies, given the M5S’s stated opposition to big industry.Giovanni Tria, a little known economics professor, was named to lead the finance ministry. While Tria has been critical of the EU, he is not been seen as an advocate for an exit from the eurozone.The new deal was blessed by Mattarella, who earlier this week nominated a technocrat, Carlo Cottarelli, to serve as prime minister. Those plans were put on hold after Mattarella opted to give the populists more time to reach a new agreement.The new government is expected to take a far more antagonistic stance against Brussels than the previous government, headed by the centre-left Democratic party. But the alliance between the M5S and the League will have only a relatively narrow majority in the Italian senate, easing concerns among investors and officials in Brussels over the new government’s decision-making. While both parties are populist in nature, and have railed against Brussels and Italian “elites”, they have long been natural opponents in politics.Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of Teneo Intelligence in London, said: “They are both led by young and ambitious leaders who share prime-ministerial ambitions. Due to mutual distrust, it has taken both parties over 70 days to reach a deal and choose an unknown third figure as prime minister.”Their shared agenda includes plans to cut taxes, scrap a previously agreed pension plan and institute a “universal basic income”.While many officials in Brussels sought to ease tensions with Rome this week, and backed Mattarella after the president took a political risk by defending Italy’s role in the EU, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, issued a tough critique of Italy on Thursday. He said Italians needed to work harder, be less corrupt and stop looking to the EU to rescue the country’s poor regions.“Italians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work, less corruption, seriousness,” Juncker said. “We will help them as we always did. But don’t play this game of loading with responsibility the EU. A country is a country, a nation is a nation. Countries first, Europe second.”Additional reporting by Daniel Boffey in Brussels"},{"url":null,"title":"clare daly gives impassioned testimony on referendum result in the d%C3%A1il","story":"  May 29, 2018TD applauded by colleagues after impassioned speech during first D\u0026aacuteil sitting since referendum "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: Getty Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis is creating a Brexit plan that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and European Union status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland, The Sun newspaper reported on Thursday.Mr Davis is drawing a proposed 16km-wide trade buffer zone along the border that would be in effect for local traders, like dairy farmers, after Britain leaves the bloc, the newspaper said. The Department of Foreign Affairs offered no comment on the specific proposal in a statement released in response to the plan the UK’s Brexit secretary is reportedly creating. Instead it urged Britain to engage with the EU “in a more detailed way” on the parts of the draft Brexit treaty relating to Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the “backstop” option that would keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union and single market if no other solution was found to avoid a hard border.“At this stage in the process, the UK must engage in a more detailed way on the draft text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop,” said a spokesman for the department.“The engagement must be through the formal negotiation with the Task Force, led by Michel Barnier. The Tánaiste and Irish officials are in ongoing contact with the EU Task Force team.”Mr Davis’s plan is a revision of the “max fac” or “maximum facilitation” plan, the report said, citing a source.British prime minister Theresa May previously pledged to take the UK out of the EU customs union by considering two options.One would be “max fac” in which the UK and EU would be entirely separate customs areas but would try to use technology to reduce friction and costs at the border.The other option being considered is a “customs partnership”, according to which the UK would co-operate with the EU more closely and collect tariffs on its behalf with no requirement of declarations of goods crossing the border.The European Union previously criticised Ms May for not setting out how the UK would achieve a frictionless border with the EU without erecting a land border to control goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Britain suggested earlier this month that it would be willing to extend the use of EU tariffs as a backstop if there were delays in ratification of a Brexit deal to avoid a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, adding the government did not want to use that option. The British Irish Chamber of Commerce dismissed the idea of a 10-mile Border buffer zone being considered by the UK government as “unworkable.”“Moving the problem of the Border to 10 miles away won’t solve the problem,” said John McGrane, the director-general of the chamber. “All that will happen in a dual-territory model is added costs of complying with double regulations - and more costs means less jobs.”The chamber was “aghast” that, with the clock on negotiations “ticking down daily towards a potential hard Brexit,” that the UK government is still not saying clearly how it will deliver a borderless future for trade both northsouth and eastwest between the UK and Ireland, he said. - additional reporting - ReutersNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3516235.1527859175!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lions and tigers recaptured after escaping german zoo","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLions, tigers and a jaguar broke out of a German zoo on Friday.

Eighty-five per cent of the dogs running on British greyhound tracks every year are Irish, with British trainers typically sending bitches to Ireland for breeding.The free movement of dogs between the two islands has flourished since at least the late 1860s, when Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup three times to become the most celebrated dog in the world. Master McGrath was commemorated with a statue in Lurgan and a monument in his home town of Dungarvan, and inspired a ballad that framed his race against an English competitor in terms of British-Irish rivalry: As Rose and the Master they both ran along, ‘Now I wonder,’ says Rose, ‘what took you from your home You should have stayed there in your Irish domain, And not come to gain laurels on Albion’s plain.’ ‘Well, I know,’ says McGrath, ‘we have wild heather bogs But you’ll find in old Ireland there’s good men and dogs. Lead on, bold Britannia, give none of your jaw, Stuff that up your nostrils,’ says Master McGrath.Greyhound racing in Britain has been in decline since the 1950s, with the number of tracks falling from more than 100 to fewer than 30. Unlike horse racing, which benefits from a levy on betting, greyhound racing receives no subsidy from the bookmakers.Live hare coursing, the sport in which Master McGrath won his laurels, is banned in Britain, but accusations of cruelty continue to pursue dog racing, which has also been damaged by scandals around doping after dogs were given cocaine to run faster. At the English Greyhound Derby lunch in London this week, its chairman, Alexander Hesketh, identified animal welfare as the greatest challenge facing the sport.Hesketh, a hereditary peer whose seat in the House of Lords was abolished in 1999, owns Towcester race course and is on a mission to modernise greyhound racing in Britain and around the world. The owners of every dog that runs at his course must pay a fee of £200, which is matched by Towcester to create what he calls a “canine pension fund” to rehome greyhounds when their racing days are over. Greyhound races now publish injury statistics, which show that injuries and deaths are lower than in horse racing, and Hesketh will soon launch a “Towcester standard” guaranteeing high welfare standards for animals.Hesketh was chief whip in the Lords under John Major, but left the Conservatives in 2011 to join Ukip and has been an enthusiastic advocate for Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. One of his passions is now in conflict with another, however, as Brexit threatens to complicate the free movement of dogs between Ireland and Britain.Liam Dowling, who breeds greyhounds at Ballymac Kennels in\u0026nbspBallymacelligott, \u0026nbspCo Kerry, has already seen his business suffer from the 14 per cent depreciation in sterling since the Brexit vote two years ago.“Our kennels are only 10 minutes from Farranfore, Kerry Airport. In that sense we are 90 minutes from London. We’re closer to London than Dublin for many interested buyers. But since the depreciation in Sterling, a lot less buyers are flying in to consider buying a greyhound. After the recession in 2008, our family business thought we were past all of that but the prospect of Brexit means more uncertainty,” he said.Currently, dogs travelling to Britain require a pet passport, a rabies vaccination and a health check by a vet 48 hours prior to travel with a registered transporter.\u0026nbspThat process could become more complicated and time-consuming if Britain leaves the EU without a deal or if the greyhound industry is not protected in a future trade agreement. Gerard Dollard, chief executive of Bord na gCon, is anxious about the impact of Brexit on an industry that involves 12,000 people and generates €300 million in economic activity.“Brexit is a game-changer for the greyhound sector,” he said. “There are thousands of jobs across rural Ireland dependent on a vibrant industry. There are no alternative export markets. As the semi-State body responsible for the commercial development of the sector, engagement has been ongoing between Bord na gCon and the Department of Agriculture. Their officials recognise the economic and social risk that potentially arises from Brexit. Like other sectors we need in as far as possible a frictionless border.”"},{"url":null,"title":"valerie jarrett hopes for teaching moment from roseanne barr s tweet","story":"  May 29, 2018Roseanne Barr compared a former Obama official to an ape in remarks on Twitter   May 30, 2018Actor\u0026rsquos racist Valerie Jarrett tweet came as little surprise to her social media followers   May 30, 2018Shortly after the Roseanne show was cancelled, right-wing commentators were engaged in \u0026lsquomental gymnastics\u0026rsquo "},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Pedro Sánchez: How Spain\u0026#39s new prime minister could help reset the crisis in CataloniaFlorida police brutally beat suspect with batonsComment: Why, as a man, I\u0026#39m completely okay with \u0026#39objectifying\u0026#39 men like Poldark\u0026#39s Aidan TurnerComment: Donald Trump has had enough of experts, so why not invite Kim Kardashian to the White House?30,000 British workers and five million tonnes of European steel: What\u0026#39s at risk from Trump\u0026#39s steel tariffHero police officer who fought London Bridge terrorists is back on his feet and hopes to return to work next monthMeet Nubia: the only baby ever to have survived EbolaChristine Lampard hid from stalker in bedroom when Twitter obsessive turned up at their houseTwo lions, two tigers and a jaguar escape from German zooNew glove could help in the fight against hospital superbugs     UK weather: Thunderstorms, heavy rain and flood warnings on first day of summer -

Today, some 1.1 billion people - 20 per cent of the population over the age of 15 - smoke.  Yet, although most countries have seen a fall in smoking rates, only a minority of countries look set to meet global and national commitments to cut tobacco use in over 15s by 30 per cent by 2025. The UK is one of a handful of countries on track to meet this goal.Which countries are on track to meet global tobacco reduction targets?The UK, where the first voluntary warnings appeared on cigarette packets in the 1970s and a smoking ban in public places has been in force since 2007, is one of a number of mostly wealthy countries that has led the way in tobacco control. Today just 16 per cent of the British population smokes, compared to 46 per cent in 1974.Across the rest of Europe smoking is also fast falling out of fashion. Last week, a new study revealed that smoking is starting to lose its allure in France as one million daily smokers kicked the habit in the last year thanks to the recent introduction of anti-smoking measures including higher taxes on cigarettes and plain packaging.Even Greece -  the European country where the biggest proportion of the population lights up - has seen a fall in smoking rates by almost two percentage points a year.Where are people stubbing out their cigarettes?The report reveals, however, that there are stark disparities between countries and regions. While 62 million smokers  in high-income countries stubbed out their cigarettes between 2000 and 2015, the number of smokers in low and middle income countries actually increased by 33 million.Less wealthy countries will see an increase in smokersThe report said that efforts to reduce tobacco use in low and middle income countries has likely been impeded by the tobacco industry whose relentless lobbying has stopped governments from introducing stronger policies.Dr Vinayak Prasad, co-lead author of the report and programme manager of  WHO\u0027s Tobacco Control, Prevention of Non Communicable Diseases team said: “It’s easier to get the political will and to explain the problem of tobacco but the tobacco industry is taking strong measures - they use all kinds of arguments such as the argument that controlling tobacco harms people\u0027s livelihoods.  The data however, disproves that controlling tobacco affects livelihoods.”The WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region - which covers much of the Middle East and North Africa - is one region where overall smoking rates have barely fallen. The actual number of people smoking is expected to rise from 47 million in 2000 to 103 million in 2025 - a more than two-fold increase.Smoking rate are falling in most of the world- except the Middle East and AfricaDr Prasad said that multiple reasons lie behind high smoking rates in the region. “It’s culturally and socially acceptable to use the water pipe in many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region, there’s been no strong leadership to push tobacco reduction at the highest level and countries have been hesitant to tax,” he said.Some GCC countries such as the UAE which introduced a \u0027sin tax\u0027 on cigarettes last October are starting to take measures but these have so far not been sufficient, according to Dr. Prasad.Some countries are bucking global trends as more people light upWhile the picture in many low and middle income countries is less sanguine, one group that is bucking the trend is women.Globally, women are kicking the habit faster in all regions of the world except Europe. “European women are an outlier globally,” said Dr Prasad. He said that factors including more liberal gender attitudes are contributing to a slower fall in smoking among women.Every year tobacco kills seven million people around the world – more than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.Tobacco use and second-hand smoke exposure are key causes of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and stroke. Cardiovascular diseases kill 18 million people each year - with smoking responsible for some three million of these deaths.“The single biggest killer in the world is cardiovascular disease,” said Dr Prasad. “They are responsible for almost 44 percent of non-communicable disease deaths. If you fix the heart problem, you fix a big proportion of NCDs,” he said. According to the WHO few people are aware of the link between heart disease and tobacco as there is evidence of a serious lack of knowledge of the multiple health risks associated with tobacco.“Most people know that using tobacco causes cancer and lung disease, but many people aren’t aware that tobacco also causes heart disease and stroke – the world’s leading killers,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.In recent years, more countries have adopted tobacco control policies such as plain packaging, taxation and banning smoking in public places.More people are now covered by tobacco control measuresAlthough Dr Prasad acknowledges that the tobacco industry and the continual development of novel products to continue to lure smokers remains an obstacle, he said that tobacco control policies have had a marked impact in many countries - including in low and middle income countries.“Taxation for sure is definitely an instrument - the additional revenue has been used to help the government fund universal health care in places like the Philippines,” said Dr Prasad. “Smoke free policies also cost very little as do warning labels and plain packaging,” he added.   Although the WHO’s current projection shows few countries will meet the 30 per cent target, Dr Prasad pointed to the example of France as evidence of what a country can achieve with political will. “France wasn’t doing anything until 2016 then woke up and introduced plain packaging. Things change.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyPedro Sánchez: How Spain\u0026#39s new prime minister could help reset the crisis in CataloniaFlorida police brutally beat suspect with batonsComment: Why, as a man, I\u0026#39m completely okay with \u0026#39objectifying\u0026#39 men like Poldark\u0026#39s Aidan TurnerComment: Donald Trump has had enough of experts, so why not invite Kim Kardashian to the White House?30,000 British workers and five million tonnes of European steel: What\u0026#39s at risk from Trump\u0026#39s steel tariffHero police officer who fought London Bridge terrorists is back on his feet and hopes to return to work next monthMeet Nubia: the only baby ever to have survived EbolaChristine Lampard hid from stalker in bedroom when Twitter obsessive turned up at their houseTwo lions, two tigers and a jaguar escape from German zooNew glove could help in the fight against hospital superbugs     UK weather: Thunderstorms, heavy rain and flood warnings on first day of summer - with more on wayJean-Claude Juncker apologies for remarks suggesting that southern Italy is corrupt and lazy\u0026#39Zombie knife\u0026#39 road rage attack: cyclist attacks driver with weapon after accidental collisionSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy forced out of job after losing no-confidence voteFirefighters carry commuters out of flooded Didcot Parkway stationWho could replace Matt LeBlanc as Top Gear host?\u0026#39British\u0026#39 royal expert \u0026#39exposed as Tommy from New York\u0026#39Love Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"british royal expert exposed tommy new york","story":"Those watching the royal wedding on foreign channels may not have been surprised to see a \u0027royal expert\u0027 with a plummy voice and a triple-barreled name explaining the festivities to viewers.However, a man who calls himself Thomas J Mace-Archer-Mills Esq was reportedly not all he seemed.Mr Mace-Archer-Mills has built himself a relatively large media platform over the past few years, touting himself as an expert on the British royals, speaking in an English accent - but, according to US media reports, he is a New Yorker named Thomas “Tommy” Muscatello.Mr Muscatello appeared on multiple foreign networks over the weekend, wearing tweed and a bow tie, pronouncing his opinions on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Producers seemingly thought they were commissioning a bona fide upper-crust British man.His website lists scores of broadcasters who have enlisted his views on royal matters including many BBC radio stations, as well as many from around the globe.He told a US channel from a five-star hotel that the Duchess of Sussex should not upstage existing members of the royal family “especially when you’re coming in the way you are”.The royal enthusiast also told a Norwegian broadcaster that the marriage should be about keeping integrity, keeping formality and making sure that the traditions and heritage that we have as British people remain at the forefront.He said of Ms Markle in a video recorded outside Buckingham Palace: “She is loud, she is American, she fights for her cause. We don’t do that here.“We do things quietly with dignity.“Ms Markle is going to be a little bit challenged when it comes to that because she’s so used to doing things the American way, which is not the British way.”The royal expert was so widely-interviewed that one piece described him as the most interviewed man on the subject of the royal wedding. He retweeted this message to his followers.The Wall Street Journal reported the alleged true background of the 38-year-old Italian-American, who told the newspaper that he identifies more as British than American, and that he had been obsessed with the UK as a child.He said he made his surname using the “names of friends and distant relations” and that he has an agreement with two unrelated elderly British people who let him call them his grandparents.However, he later responded to the claims in the WSJ, saying: The Wall Street Journal breached journalistic trust, omitted truths and mis-sold what the initial interview was for, he said.Many of the facts in the article are inaccurate and the Wall Street Journal itself was given many opportunities to ensure that the article was published with the most accurate information available. The WSJ chose not to adhere to the facts or their integrity.The  has contacted Mr Muscatello for comment.The WSJ said in a statement: We stand by our reporting.Please review our commenting policyPedro Sánchez: How Spain\u0026#39s new prime minister could help reset the crisis in CataloniaFlorida police brutally beat suspect with batonsComment: Why, as a man, I\u0026#39m completely okay with \u0026#39objectifying\u0026#39 men like Poldark\u0026#39s Aidan TurnerComment: Donald Trump has had enough of experts, so why not invite Kim Kardashian to the White House?30,000 British workers and five million tonnes of European steel: What\u0026#39s at risk from Trump\u0026#39s steel tariffHero police officer who fought London Bridge terrorists is back on his feet and hopes to return to work next monthMeet Nubia: the only baby ever to have survived EbolaChristine Lampard hid from stalker in bedroom when Twitter obsessive turned up at their houseTwo lions, two tigers and a jaguar escape from German zooNew glove could help in the fight against hospital superbugs     UK weather: Thunderstorms, heavy rain and flood warnings on first day of summer - with more on wayJean-Claude Juncker apologies for remarks suggesting that southern Italy is corrupt and lazy\u0026#39Zombie knife\u0026#39 road rage attack: cyclist attacks driver with weapon after accidental collisionSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy forced out of job after losing no-confidence voteFirefighters carry commuters out of flooded Didcot Parkway stationWho could replace Matt LeBlanc as Top Gear host?Love Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVWhat next for Iraq?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We have been focusing on what\u0027s close to us, but there\u0027s a wealth of information in the distant reaches of the solar system too, she added.The research was led by scientists from the University of Plymouth, University of Cologne in\u0026nbspGermany,\u0026nbspand Brigham Young University in\u0026nbspthe US.It was published in the journal Science.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Thanks for a great drive.LeBlanc, 50, will present his fourth and final series of the car programme later this year.The American actor was a surprise addition to the Top Gear presenting line-up along with Chris Evans two years ago, following the departure of previous hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.He then continued hosting the show after Evans threw in the towel after just one series.Evans said at the time that LeBlanc was the captain and backed him staying on the programme, and viewers praised his efforts when he returned without the BBC Radio 2 DJ.In recent series, LeBlanc, who is also known for his role in sitcom Episodes, has been joined by co-hosts Chris Harris and Rory Reid.Patrick Holland, controller for BBC Two, said: I want to thank the fabulous Matt LeBlanc for being a brilliant co-host on Top Gear.Matt has thrown himself into the show with real passion, revealing his extraordinary car knowledge and a willingness to get down and dirty.We were always going to be borrowing him from his day job as one of the top comic actors in Hollywood so I wish him all the very best.The next series of Top Gear (Matt\u0027s last) promises to be something very special and we have great plans to welcome a new co-host to join the team for 2019 and beyond.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This typically consists of\u0026nbspbroad issues like macroeconomic concerns, the threat of terrorism and\u0026nbspcyber-security.No minutes are taken, however, and the outcome of their discussions are not made public, hence the assumption that they are a sinister cabal of the rich and powerful with something to hide.The Bilderberg Group take their name from the Hotel de Bilderberg\u0026nbspin Oosterbeek, the Netherlands, where its members first convened on 29 May 1954 at the invitation of Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld.Its founders -\u0026nbspincluding exiled Polish politician Jozef\u0026nbspRetinger, ex-Belgian prime minister Paul van Zeeland and Paul Rijkens, former head of consumer goods giant Unilever -\u0026nbspwere concerned about a prevailing atmosphere of anti-American sentiment in post-war Europe in a moment when the US was enjoying a consumer boom while\u0026nbspholding the fate of the recovering continent in its hands through the Marshall Plan.\u0026nbspThe group hoped to revive a spirit of transatlantic brotherhood based on political, economic and military cooperation, necessary during the Cold War as the USSR tightened its iron grip on its eastern satellites.\u0026nbspSixty-one delegates, including 11 Americans, from a total of\u0026nbsp12 countries attended the inaugural conference, with candidates chosen to bring complimentary conservative and liberal points of view, future Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell among them. Its success meant subsequent meetings were held in France, Germany, Denmark before the first on American soil at\u0026nbspSt Simons Island in Georgia.The Bilderberg\u0026nbspGroup\u0027s primary goal has reportedly been expanded to take in a more all-encompassing endorsement of Western free market capitalism over the years, although the conspiracy theorists believe their agenda is either to impose pan-global fascism or totalitarian Marxism. They\u0027re just not sure which.Although members do not as a rule discuss what goes on within its conferences, Labour MP and onetime party deputy leader Denis Healey, a member of the steering committee for more than 30 years, did offer a clear statement of its intentions when quizzed by journalist Jon Ronson for his book Them in 2001.\u0026nbspTo say we were striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair, he said.\u0026nbspThose of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn\u0027t go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it.

Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays. An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting. Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail.They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain. It’s the only way we’ll focus minds across Europe.Without a plan, we’re only planning to fail.THE calls for abortion reform in Northern Ireland are entirely understandable.It looks increasingly odd that its laws are so out of step with both the rest of the UK and now with their southern neighbour.But Ulster’s abortion laws have always been a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.For devolution to work, Westminster needs to acknowledge the right of the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish to set their own rules.It’s not a pick ’n’ mix depending whether or not MPs agree with them.And the way some Labour politicians have suddenly become dedicated activists to drive a wedge between the PM and the DUP is shameless.The Government’s priority in Northern Ireland must be to restore a functioning Assembly, which has been missing for more than 500 days. Then the province can have an abortion debate.But it is for Ulster, not Westminster, to make any decisions.KYLIE Minogue has had us Spinning Around for decades. We wish the Red Blooded Woman a very happy birthday.If only we could all be So Lucky to look that good at 50.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its lavishly-funded Remainer stooges aim to do the same with Brexit.How does Brussels think this all ends?If Brexit is negated there will be a collapse of faith in democracy and probable civil unrest beyond anyone’s experience.In Italy, eurosceptic parties will now have an even bigger mandate. What then?The EU meets any dissent not with wise compromise but with brute force.It is the enemy of democracy. Its contempt for voters will prove its epitaph.WE like Theresa May’s tougher tone towards the EU.

It will mean that I wont be able to go to school, go to work or go out with my family.But I wont take my niqab off so I have to find another solution.Pape Poulsen, who leads the conservative party in the coalition, has described keeping ones face hidden in public as incompatible with the values of Danish society or respect for the community.But Ibn Hssain rejected suggestions that wearing the veil symbolised the rejection of Danish values or oppression of women.She said: It has nothing to do with integration or that were oppressed. For me it is a war on Islam.Human rights group Amnesty International called the ban a discriminatory violation of womens rights ... All women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs.Ibn Hssain, who says she has been yelled at and spat at in public for wearing the niqab, will stay for now in Denmark despite the ban.She said: If I leave Denmark the politicians win.

That’s not how the world is set up at the moment.”Morgan Cowley, former chairman of the Highland LGBTI forum which campaigns for the fair treatment of all LGBTI people, said: “I think introducing non-gender specific sports days into schools is rather a clumsy way of trying to address the crux of the matter within our schools, which is promoting respect for one another and celebrating difference.“There are undoubtedly more astute ways of doing this and what Merkinch Primary is doing seems to be increasing conflict rather than reducing it.“Trying to promote nongender specific sports into schools at this point in our society’s development, when the whole world celebrates and enjoys gender-specific sport at the highest levels, seems a hard sell.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000005058965-e1527844664660.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"netflix menu kate middleton escorts film menu","story":"The gaffe saw the Duchess of Cambridge kissing Prince William on the top half but the bottom half of the image was spliced with a tattooed girl in racy stockings and lace underwear.The snap, posted on Reddit by Big_Miss_Steak_, was meant to advertise documentary The Royals, which features interviews with those close to the family.But it somehow got mixed up with racy film Escorts, which is billed as provocative and steamy by Netflix.The shows synopsis reads: Get an unflinching look at two high-priced call girls who rely on the internet to find clients, and the effects of their lifestyle on their families.The shot was posted on Reddit with the caption: The risqué side of Netflix.

Neither of these proposals are operational or acceptable to us.\"Both the EU and the UK government are committed to there being no hardening of the Irish border after Brexit, with Mrs May hoping to display progress on the issue at the next EU summit on 28 June.A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the EU said: \"We have set out two viable future customs arrangements with the EU and work is ongoing to refine these.\"Both of these would deliver on our commitments to ensure UK-EU trade is as frictionless as possible, avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, preserve the integrity of the UK\u0027s internal market and enable us to establish an independent international trade policy.\"A Downing Street spokesman said the Prime Minister was \"absolutely clear that we cannot and will not accept a customs border down the Irish Sea, and that we will preserve the integrity of the UK\u0027s common market\".They added: \"Work is ongoing on customs plans that will achieve this, as well as ensuring we can strike trade deals around the world, that trade remains as frictionless as possible, and that there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\"The emergence of the new plans came as Northern Ireland\u0027s police chief revealed the service will be asking for more officers after the UK leaves the EU."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-prime-minister_4325533.jpg?20180601112429 ","title":"meghan and harry wedding british royal expert is american from new york","story":"In another interview he gave to a US outlet, he reportedly told the bride-to-be not to upstage members of the Royal Family \"especially when you\u0027re coming in the way you are\".Videos posted to the BMSF YouTube page document his many media appearances and his work at various monarchist conferences.In one video filmed in St James\u0027 Park, near Buckingham Palace, he jokingly talked to a Shaun the Sheep statue, which was wearing a crown, and he said: \"We have a little fun here in London, monarchy is always so stiff and proper and firm and \u0027how dare you make fun and have a laugh\u0027.He said he had adopted a British accent and started ending conversations by saying \"God save the Queen\" - despite living in Bolton Landing, New York.The royal enthusiast said he adopted his surname by putting together \"names of friends and distant relations\".

Trying to figure out the best way of making use of all the additional family time? We hear you! Whether it’s camping or picnics in the park, there are plenty of activities you can enjoy with little ones that cost next to nothing. Here are some ideas that we think they’ll love – and some tips on how to really make the most of your half term. Get close to nature    One really great way to engage with your kids for a couple of days is to go foraging and cooking in the wild. Some things you can pick are perfectly safe - like apples, blackberries, certain plants and even some flowers. But for the main course you might want to bring along some supermarket staples! Always be careful when using stoves. You can use them anywhere and The Woodland Trust prefer campers to use them over a campfire as they\u0027re much safer.  Fire up this camping stove for a fantastic grill - be it on the road or in your back garden for an at home adventure - which is just \u0026pound8 (save \u0026pound12) at Halfords. Mix up cooking things you\u0027ve brought from home with bits you\u0027ve sourced locally for a great combo. And don’t forget to pack the Halfords Rainbow Plastic Plates which are now half price at just \u0026pound3 (was \u0026pound3) to dine out in style.      If you’ve got a couple of days then you could take everyone out for a long cycle ride, broken up by either nights in a hotel or camping. If you don’t want to stay the night there are plenty of UK cycle routes – check Sustrans for those in your area – which you can drive to during the day.  Check out Halfords’ options for bike racks if you need to load your bikes onto a car – the Thule ProRide 591 is \u0026pound85 (save \u0026pound25), but also on buy one, get one free. That\u0027s ideal if you\u0027re looking to take a couple of bikes with you on your adventure as each rack holds one bike. And right now at Halfords you can get free fitting too.  If you have very little children then it’s also worth considering an alternative way to transport them. Halfords has a range of bike seats for juniors as well as an amazing Double Buggy Bike Trailer for \u0026pound110 (save \u0026pound110, 50lbs weight limit per child, not for use with a child under 12 months old).  Little kids have an absolute blast being towed around, and you’ll hear a lot of delighted giggles and yells when you’re doing it. Make sure you also get bike helmets that fit securely for both you and your little ones. Halfords has a wide range to choose from and can help you to find the right fit. And before heading off why not get a Free Bike Check from Halfords? You can either book online or just pop in to your local store for a 32-point check. Everything from the frame to the saddle and the wheels to the gears are given a thorough check by an in-store expert. Getting the check means you can relax, knowing your bike is in great shape for your trip. Let the games begin      There are all sorts of major sporting events on this year, so why not hold some of your own competitions. You can then arrange lots of little events for your wannabe stars of tomorrow, from football and running to swimming and cycling. If you’re in need of a new bike for your young ones Halfords has a great range, including the Apollo Gridlok kids mountain bike, which has been reduced by \u0026pound31 and is now only \u0026pound124. There is 20 per cent off a whole range of kids bikes too, so there’s bound to be something that suits your little athletes.  If the kids have bikes but you don’t, perhaps it’s time to take advantage of 20 per cent off a range of adult bikes – the Carrera Vengeance is now \u0026pound264 (save \u0026pound66). Make exercise rewarding If you’ve got older kids that love nothing more than heading out on two wheels to explore with friends, then there are lots of options. Come up with a number of miles to cycle in a day, week or even month and get them a cycle computer from Halfords (starting at \u0026pound8.50). You can fit it together then dispatch them on chores! For every mile you could reward them, either with extra pocket money or just their choice of movie to watch with you later.

But last night he had particularly famous co-star as he shared the One Show sofa with the All Night singer. Mr Lewis was explaining the latest moves by Britain\u0027s financial watchdog to clamp down on rent-to-own operators and door-step lending who exploit the poorest by adding on interest and extra charges to their purchases. It basically means the amount you end up paying for your fridge could be once, twice, three times as much.  The 68-year-old soul singer, who has sold over 90 million records worldwide, was happy to help. He told Mr Lewis You can use me, use me as the money expert launched into an animated explanation of the perils of door step lending.  He explained how doorstop lenders will often target those already in debt offering them ways of putting off the repayment which only end up with them paying more in the long-run.    The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a radical overhaul of bank overdraft charges, rent-to-own operators, door-step lending and catalogue credit and store cards, following a wide-ranging review of the sector.

The government has considered proposing a 10-mile (16-km)- wide trade buffer zone along the border for local traders like dairy farmers after the UK leaves the bloc. The plan is one of several ideas being discussed and may not be proposed to the EU, according to a government official. But the plans are likely to be given short shrift by the DUP who are propping up the Tory government as they oppose any plan that sees the province operate under different regulations to the rest of the United Kingdom. Both the UK and the EU are committed to keeping a free flow of people and goods over the Irish border without returning to checkpoints - symbols of the three decades of violence in the region largely ended by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.  However, finding a practical solution for any customs checks needed after Brexit is proving elusive. The government is considering a special economic zone that will mean traders, who constitute 90 percent of cross-border traffic, can operate under the same rules as those south of the border, according to The Sun newspaper, which first reported that the idea was being considered. May previously pledged to take the UK out of the EU customs union by considering two options. One would be max fac in which the UK and EU would be entirely separate customs areas but would try to use technology to reduce friction and costs at the border.  The other option being considered is a customs partnership, according to which the UK would collect tariffs on the EU\u0027s behalf with no requirement of declarations of goods crossing the border. EU officials are warning time is running out to seal a Brexit deal this year because there has been not enough progress in negotiations. And they blame Theresa May for failing to come up with a solution to the Irish border problem. They have already rejected both of the Tories\u0027 solutions - and there is no sign they would accept the latest proposal.

Right-winger Mariano Rajoy was dramatically toppled today and replaced by socialist Pedro Sanchez. Rajoy was forced out after seven years in power following a wave of financial scandals involving his Popular Party. He announced his departure ahead of a vote of confidence in the Spanish Parliament. The motion, called by Sanchez, won 180 votes for, 169 against and 1 abstention.  Sanchez will become the seventh prime minister since the Franco dictatorship when he takes office. He suggested on Thursday he would try to govern until the scheduled end of the parliamentary term in mid-2020. But it is unclear how long his administration, with only 84 Socialist deputies in the 350-member legislative assembly, can last. He has already committed to respecting a budget passed by Rajoy, and the fragmented parliament means Sanchez will find it hard to row back on structural reforms passed by his predecessor, including new labour laws and cuts in healthcare and education. Leftist Podemos, which will offer parliamentary support to Sanchez\u0027s government, is unlikely to gain big influence over the new Prime Minister, who is keen to differentiate his Socialist party from its anti-austerity ally and win back centrist voters.

Martha Dolak was trapped after her controlling partner Michael Goodwin locked the doors to his flat before beating her to a pulp - causing her to suffer facial and skull fractures as well as permanent damage to her optical nerves. But in a clever escape bid, the 31-year-old snapped a selfie of her horrific injuries and sent it to a friend, who immediately alerted Martha\u0027s parents and the police. The brutal attack, which took place in October last year whilst Michael\u0027s two young children were in the next room, escalated after the manipulative builder checked through Martha\u0027s phone.   Multiple casualties after car hits crowd in Greater Manchester hit and run as \u0027people flung everywhere\u0027  He saw a text from a friend she\u0027d confided in about his controlling ways, urging her to leave him. She said: When Michael saw the message he was livid. I was terrified so I tried to get my things and go. He told me I couldn\u0027t leave and both the doors were locked. I went to the window to see if I could jump out safely - but suddenly I felt an excruciating pain and remember nothing else.  I woke up in bed. I knew he must have put me there but I couldn\u0027t move. I couldn\u0027t feel my legs and I had the most painful headache, I couldn\u0027t lift my head up at all. My eye wouldn\u0027t open and my face felt thick with dry blood. I took a selfie - I wanted to see what was wrong with me. I was horrified at what I saw. I sent the picture to my friend so that she would get help. It was only afterwards that I realised he had kicked me in the head.  My friend told my parents straight away, and my dad, who doesn\u0027t speak very good English, went to the police station with the text. The police went to an old address for Michael first and spoke to his sister.  She told the police I had fallen down the stairs, and then came to Michael\u0027s  new house to warn him they were on to him.  After she came they reluctantly decided to take me to the hospital. I could have died if I was left without medical attention for much longer.  After the attack Martha left Michael, 30, for good and took out an injunction against him. Martha, from London and who had been in a relationship for 18 months, added: After the attack people would say to me he\u0027s an animal - but he is not, he is a monster. I want to raise awareness and show to people that no matter how educated you are no matter how strong you look it can happen to anyone. I never expected this to happen to someone like me, I thought because I\u0027m smart, have a degree, am independent and see myself as a feminist that I would be able to see it happening.  But domestic violence does not choose someone based on those things. It\u0027s been the most horrific experience of my life but it made me stronger. I am not looking for sympathy, I just want to raise awareness of him so that other girls know what he is like. I have left Michael for good and I will never get into a another violent relationship ever again.

However he has now been \u0027unmasked\u0027 as Thomas Tommy Muscatello - an Italian-American, who grew up in New York. But the 38-year-old has slammed the claims in the Wall Street Journal, saying his interview with them omitted truths. In an interview on the day of the nuptials he told a Norwegian broadcaster that the former Suits actress should be aware that marriage in the royal family must be about keeping integrity, keeping formality and making sure that the traditions and heritage that we have as British people remain at the forefront.  And as the couple approached St. George’s Chapel on May 19, he tells France’s TF1 television in a posh British accent: “We’re making world history.”  Mace-Archer-Mills Tommy told the Wall Street Journal he loved England as a boy and had an innate feeling for British pronunciation growing up, picking up his accent in a variety of ways, primarily from visiting the UK.  His transformation into Mr Mace-Archer-Mills, he said, came from a growing realisation that he identified more as British than American. He said growing up he would end conversations by saying God save the Queen - despite living in Bolton Landing, New York. “I found where I’m supposed to be and who I am supposed to be, he said.  However, he declined to talk about his nationality, only saying that his surname was created by putting together names of friends and distant relations. And he said he had an agreement with two unrelated, elderly British people to call them his grandfather and grandmother. Talking about \u0027our\u0027 British culture during an interview with the Daily Blast he said Meghan had made a wise choice with her wedding dress because the queen does not like frivolous sorts of flesh so what Meghan wore was absolutely ideal. Talking from his kitchen with a book on Harry and Meghan and a little Union Jack visible in the background, he adds: If the queen doesn\u0027t like it it\u0027s just not had anywhere.

Dashcam video captured the terrifying incident as it unfolded in a busy south London street. Dramatic footage shows a a blue Volkswagen pulling out from a queue of traffic and appearing to almost hit the cyclist. The Volkswagen hits an oncoming vehicle and the cyclist pulls out a massive blade, using it to try and smash the car\u0027s front window, the Croydon Advertiser reports. The driver runs off and ditches his car after the cyclist tries to open a locked door.  Police were alerted and are now trying to trace the man who was wielding the knife. Stunned rush hour commuters looked on as the cyclist attacked the car in London Road in Croydon at about 5pm on Wednesday. In the footage a man on a bicycle can be seen to stop next to the stationary Volkswagen.  The car pulls out from a queue of traffic and appears to almost hit the cyclist, forcing him to jump out of the way. The Volkswagen then hits an oncoming vehicle. The man on the bicycle then pulls out a huge knife and uses it to try and smash the driver\u0027s front window.  He then attempts to get into the vehicle via one of the passenger doors, but finds it is locked. The knife-wielding man then makes his way over to the other side of the car. At this point the driver gets out of the car and makes off on foot.  A Met Police spokeswoman said no one has been arrested in connection with the incident. The spokeswoman said: “We were called at around 5pm to London Road, in Croydon, after someone approached a vehicle brandishing a weapon. “With that in mind, the driver of the car has collided with another vehicle.

We want to show others that you don’t have to settle, and that you don’t have to be millionaires to travel the world.”   Natalie - who runs a home education magazine called Life Without School Collective - and William share their strong beliefs on parenting online and told their followers how they allowed their children to sleep in the bed with them until recently.

As she ended her life, her partner of 33 years James Howley was at her side. On his return to Britain, 57-year-old James suffered the trauma of being investigated by police for six months on suspicion of assisting a suicide. He said: “The stress and worry was unbearable at times. I was at rock bottom. There were times when I thought I wouldn’t get through it.  “I was exhausted, fearing I would end up in jail – all for doing the right thing by the person I loved most in the world, so that she did not have to die an undignified and agonising death.” College lecturer Helen, who died aged 59, was diagnosed with the lung disorder in 2004. She was forced to retire in 2009 due to ill health, and as the condition began to slowly suffocate her she made the decision to contact Zurich-based society Dignitas in 2015. James, who also was a lecturer, said: “Helen had reached a helpless situation. She was in pain and suffering every day...  “She said, ‘I’m not frightened of dying, but I am frightened about the way I die’. “It became very clear to her there was only going to be one course of action... “She was conscious of doing it on her own, all the research, the contact [with Dignitas], the pay\u0026shyments. “She had my support at every stage but said if I was uncomfortable with going she would consider going alone. “We knew there could be a legal issue but there was no way I was ever going to let [her] be waved off at the door.”  By the time they travelled to Switzerland, Helen’s lung capacity was just 15%. The couple boarded Le Shuttle train in their adapted car carrying Helen’s oxygen tanks and nebulisers keeping her alive. They booked into a hotel to spend their final hours together before going to Dignitas. James said: “It was a serene place... Each doctor and nurse who saw Helen asked her whether she was sure she was making the right decision. “She was fitted with a cannula to administer the life-ending drugs... When the time came we said our goodbyes and she passed away incredibly peacefully.” In a cruel twist, as Helen died in November 2016, thieves ransacked the couple’s home in West Bromwich, West Midlands. Jewellery and Helen’s computer containing cherished photos were taken by the burglars who wrapped their haul in “the last bed sheet she slept in”. A neighbour, not thinking of the implications, told police the couple had gone to Switzerland for Helen – who had lung disorder alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency – to end her life. Within hours of arriving home James was quizzed by officers. He said: “Initially they were fine... The detectives said I had nothing to worry about. I told them I had a letter written by Helen outlining her decision and we had copies of all of her medical notes and letters between her GP and consultant. They just said they would be in touch.”  Two months later he was summoned to be interviewed under caution. Assisting a suicide is punishable by up to 14 years in jail. It took detectives six months to get Helen’s medical records. In June 2017, West Midlands police finally wrote to James to say the case was being dropped. A force spokesman said: “The investigation was delayed because, despite West Midlands police requests for medical records, they were not made [available] until June last year. “That month, it was decided that it did not meet the evidential threshold for prosecution and the investigation was discontinued.” James is now campaigning alongside charity Dignity in Dying to overturn the UK’s ban on assisted dying. He is also backing 68-year-old Noel Conway, a retired college lecturer from Shrewsbury, who has motor neurone disease and whose fight to legalise assisted suicide will be heard at the Court of Appeal this week.  James, who has spoken to others probed by officers, said: “A woman had her door kicked in by police who seized all her possessions when they found her husband went to Dignitas.” He has also been in touch with Julie Smith, 48, also from West Bromwich, whose husband Paul was 57 when he died from cancer at home in September 2016. Despite attending the same GP surgery as Helen, former engineer Paul was denied his medical notes by his doctor who said he could not provide the details for him to send to Dignitas on “ethical and legal grounds”. Julie said: “Paul died in agony and without dignity weeks before Helen. “My last memories of him were of him being frightened, in pain and heartbroken. No one should have to go through that, which is why we need a change in the law.”  The campaign is boosted today by Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson, MP for West Bromwich East, who is backing a law change after hearing of the plight of the two couples. In 2015, MPs voted against an assisted dying bill by 330 votes to 118. Polls have shown a majority of the public and doctors are in favour of a restricted assisted dying law. It costs on average \u0026pound10,000 for a British patient to go to Dignitas. Sarah Wootton, of Dignity in Dying, said it is wrong the patients’ loved ones can face long police probes. She added: “Their compassionate act is treated as a crime, mementoes are kept as evidence and suspicion hangs over them at a desperately sad time.” Labour\u0027s Deputy Leader Tom Watson backs change - here\u0027s what he says  Everyone deserves a dignified death. That means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. For more and more Brits it has meant a peaceful death at the time of their choosing at Dignitas in Switzerland. Last year one Brit went there every eight days. I recently met two of my constituents whose partners were suffering from terminal illnesses and wished to end their lives at Dignitas. Their experiences couldn’t have been more different. James Howley’s partner Helen was able to get the medical documents she needed to allow her the peaceful death she wanted. But Julie Smith’s husband Paul could not access the medical letter required by the Swiss authorities because his doctor was concerned about falling foul of the law. No doctor should be put in that position: having to choose between granting their dying patient’s wish or facing possible investigation. What makes this story so strange is that Helen and Paul both attended the same GP surgery in West Bromwich. Two people, facing similar challenges at the end of their lives, had totally different deaths – one dignified, one undignified and painful. All because the law regarding helping patients go to Dignitas is a grey area. It’s not often you have such a clear demonstration of a situation that is not working, unfair and devastating for those involved.

Fans have been counting down the minutes and this series is expected to make an even bigger splash than last year. The finale on ITV2 was watched by 3.1 million people but, as this series takes place around the football World Cup, many more could check it out this time. It sounds like an unlikely TV smash, watching singletons looking for love in the sun while you sit in your PJs on the couch, but bosses are pouring money into it. “It is easily our number one show,” controller of ITV digital channels Paul Mortimer says, “so we are investing in it a bit more heavily.” With versions launched in other countries, and fans including Liam Gallagher and Stormzy, here’s what all the fuss is about...  Love Island starts with a 95-minute special at 9pm on Monday on ITV2.   The presenters Caroline Flack will welcome a new generation of islanders and speak to the evicted contestants packing their suitcases and heading home. But Caroline, below, flies in and out of the island throughout the series and arguably the biggest star of the show isn’t even seen on screen. Comedian Iain Stirling is the commentator – think the voice of Big Brother with sass and humour if you’ve not watched before – and he tells us what is going on in each episode with his tongue in his cheek. Iain only sees the footage for each episode at around 2pm and then has just a few hours to write a script filled with trademark gags – and then record it. He’s rightly become a huge star since he started to voice the show. “I’ve tried to see as little as possible,” he said, when asked what he thought of the line-up. “I try and watch as a viewer.”  How it works Every few days the islanders have to couple up, with those not in a couple at risk of being dumped from the island. But it is not just a case of 11 contestants going in and a winning couple at the end – that would be far too simple. Bosses say the path to true love is “littered with surprise bombshell arrivals” meaning by the end of the eight-week run there will have been more than 20 contestants. There will also be unexpected twists and turns like shock evictions, games, dates and bosses meddling. Most of this news is delivered to contestants via text message on one of their phones, often leading to screams of: “I’ve got a text!” And if two people fancy the same person? Bring on battles for affection and lots of gossiping in the garden.  Sex on TV Parents of contestants will want to look away and invest in ear plugs when their precious ones are doing the deed. While the footage of sex is not graphic – most couples go under a duvet - what you hear is often worse. Couples are also given the chance to spend a night in The Hideaway, a private bedroom where they can have some alone time... with the cameras still on. Bosses insist they don’t show anything graphic. “For the record, we don’t show sex on television” said ITV Studios MD Angela Jain. “We show the reaction to sex happening in the villa. “The way we cut it and treat it is part of a normal relationship. We don’t do it for any kind of salacious outcome.”  The contestants A total of 11 contestants will enter the show to begin with, all single and looking to mingle. They will then “couple up”, leaving one person the odd one out. The line-up includes a West End performer, personal trainer Adam Collard, model Hayley Hughes, an A\u0026ampE doctor and the daughter of EastEnders hardman Danny Dyer. The majority of the five women entering have had their hearts broken in the past 12 months and all of them hope they will finally find “the one” on the TV show where they have up to eight weeks to date. More than 100,000 people applied to go on the show this year but many of the contestants are offered up by agents or scouted from their social media profiles.  Bosses started with a “shortlist” of 1,000 and execs saw most of these themselves after casting agents narrowed it down. Love Island 2017 was won by Amber Davies and Kem Cetinay, although the couple split months after winning a \u0026pound50,000 prize. Kem and his co-star Chris Hughes, who came third with Olivia Attwood, went on to land a spin-off series and released a top 20 single, earning big money off the back of the success of last summer’s show.  The villa The villa is less than an hour’s drive from Palma airport in Majorca. It is the same one used last year. Camera runs in the garden are hidden in huts either side of an infinity pool and LEDs which can change colour are all around the garden floor. Executive producer Tom Gould said: “The sun deck is different and has changed in a new re-imagined space and there is a swing seat. “It makes it more attractive for them and it’s better for us to film. The hideaway has had its annual makeover. And the bedroom. “There is an inside-out theme, too. We have grass on the walls inside. And that new design has been picked up in the bedroom and lounge, to tie the whole thing as one. “On the walls and by the beds there are phrases and stuff that have been said before like ‘You OK, Hun?’ and now have a life of their own...” A smoking area has also had to be created after there were complaints last year.  Paul Mortimer says: “Because they’re a very sexy cast in a  sexy environment on a sexy channel then it made smoking look glamorous.  “Ofcom took a view that it was unacceptable. It’s not against the law to smoke cigarettes but this year we have in plan a place for the smoking area to be outside the villa rather than inside.”   The lingo  The show is well known for introducing a range of words into the nation’s vocabulary, including...  Grafting Focusing your attention on the boy/girl you want and working to woo them.   Muggy If you are doing something bad or disrespectful.   Melt Acting soppy.   Pied off When you are shot down or basically rejected.   Stick it on Make a move on a boy/girl.   My type on paper A perfect match.

Rangers right-back James Tavernier has been criticised by animal welfare advocates for pictures of ear-cropped dogs posted on his breeding business\u0027 Instagram page.  The defender recently unveiled his new enterprise, Designer Bullies UK, which breeds beefed-up American bullies for the market, the Daily Record reported .  Some dogs can fetch prices of up to \u0026pound5,000. Despite ear-cropping being banned in the EU and UK, the 26-year-old proudly poses on his social media account with dogs whose ears have been cut off with scalpels to make them fit in with the fierce image of the breed.  Tavernier’s agents were asked if the ear-cropping was done in the UK or abroad but did not respond on Thursday night.   The same day, the Scottish SPCA released a warning that ear-cropping is getting out of control, with “a worrying increase” in the number of the dogs coming into their care after tip-offs. The charity’s chief superintendent Mike Flynn stressed role models like Tavernier who post photos of “mutilated” dogs on social media should think again. He said: “Role models promoting these dogs across social media need to give serious thought about the impact of their actions. Encouraging this illegal mutilation of dogs purely for ‘status’ is incredibly damaging and quite frankly irresponsible.” He added: “Ear-cropping is cruel and unnecessary. It’s a vanity procedure that brings no benefit to the dogs involved and increases the risk of on-going health problems and infections.”   The charity’s red alert came as the Record revealed an explosion in illegal backstreet operations on American bullies, which were originally bred from American pit bulls and Staffordshire terriers.  Procedures are carried out by dog owners in their homes with makeshift scalpel, suture and anaesthetic kits bought on the internet. An undercover special investigations unit chief inspector from the charity said: “Two years ago, we didn’t have a single American bully in our care. “However, we’re now seeing a worrying increase in the number of these dogs seized as a result of our investigations. The recent increase is entirely down to the current trend to own these dogs as a status pet. “In the UK, any surgical procedure carried out for purely aesthetic purposes is illegal. Ear-cropping is one of these procedures. A common misconception is these dogs are bred for fighting but that is not the case.”  Tavernier, who signed for Rangers from Wigan in 2015, has spoken about his dog-breeding business, which is registered in Scotland with his co-director Jake Chapman. The defender claims to have loved dogs since childhood, when he had two family pets called Rio and David after Man United star Rio Ferdinand and Dutch superstar Edgar Davids. He told a press conference, where the issue of mutilated ears was never brought up: “This is something I have started with a friend who I have known since I was three. “We decided to start a business about these dogs and it is going really well at the minute. I’m enjoying it and enjoying being around the dogs. “None of my team-mates have bought one yet but I know Josh (Windass) is looking for a dog so I might try to persuade him.” Tavernier has had to look after up to six dogs at a time as the breeding cycle gets into full throttle. He said: “It runs like any other business. You have to make calls and do the rest. But it’s enjoyable.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i couldnt see hear father","story":"News\u0027I couldn\u0027t see or hear\u0027: Father describes terrifying lightning strike that threw him across his bedroom and burnt down his houseRomford father Paul Robinson, 51, was sitting at his desk when lightning struck through the window and threw him across the room\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTommy Wathen09:23, 1 JUN 2018NewsThe lightning strike set Paul Robinson\u0027s house on fire (Image: Essex Live)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA father has described the terrifying moment a bolt of lightning struck his house, setting it on fire and destroying all his possessions. Paul Robinson, 51, said he was sitting at a desk in his bedroom around 1am Sunday when lightning struck his window. The impact was so overwhelming he temporarily lost his eye-sight and hearing.  He told Essex Live : I just heard the loudest sound that I’d ever heard in my life.  “I didn’t know what had happened, but I did realise that I was no longer sitting at my desk and was now over near the doorway to the landing.  I don’t remember if I was blown across or stumbled across but I just don’t remember getting there. “I do remember thinking that I couldn’t see and that I couldn’t hear either. Paul had been renting two rooms at a property in Romford. One of the rooms he occupied was the attic room, which he shared with his 32-year-old wife Anna, while his two-year-old daughter Jasmine’s room was on the first floor. Dozens of fire-fighters rushed to the property and reported the entire second floor loft room and half the first floor of the property were damaged.  Paul, Anna and Jasmine, along with their landlord Dave, had already fled the house. Miraculously, neither Paul or Anna were in their bed, which is immediately adjacent to the window that was struck. Paul was at his desk and Anna was downstairs with their daughter. Paul continued: “I then realised that I hadn’t lost all my senses because I could smell and the first thing I could smell was burning. I didn’t know where it was coming from because I couldn’t see anything. “I staggered around the room wondering what I was going to do, which was when my sight started slowly coming back to me and I noticed a fire at the end of my bed. “My first thought was to go downstairs and check out my daughter’s room. I went to go and put the light on and the light switch had been blown off the wall and it was just hanging by the wiring. “I told my wife to grab the baby and get out the house. I didn’t leave straight away as I wanted to make sure they got out first and then Dave started coming up the stairs as he must have heard me calling for water, but I told him not to bother and to just get out the house. Paul says that he then started to feel light-headed because the house filled up with smoke.  He said: This is when I knew it was time to get myself out quickly. “There was quite a crowd gathered outside, as everyone had been woken by our neighbour’s houses shaking and car alarms were going off. “I also had a collection of snakes that we were trying to breed rarer colour forms. We were then going to sell them as a business to create the deposit for our own home. “They all died in the fire but I wasn’t really thinking of them as if I had, I probably wouldn’t have had time to get out myself. “It is good that your emotions kick in during times like that and you realise what actually means a lot to you because we couldn’t save everything and I’m glad we didn’t. But it is not the only time Paul and Anna have been caught up in a disaster zone. He said: Five years ago when I got married, we were in the Philippines when they had the worst typhoon in recorded history and we survived that. “In England, you live in homes built of bricks that are meant to survive any weather, but you then find that you are wrong.” The only things that Paul and his family now own is his car and some clothes and cuddly toys donated to him by members from his local church and friends.  “I don’t know what our options are now because we don’t have the money to go out and pay a market rent, he said. “The council will not home us because my wife is not a UK national having only been here for four years and needing to have been here for six, so it limits our options. “Our friends were going on holiday the day after the fire and had been let down by a house sitter, so luckily we were able to stay there. They are back on Monday though so I don’t know what we’ll do from there. “We knew that our room was 100 per cent fire damaged, but we held on to the hopes that some our stuff in the room below may have been salvageable but when we went back to the house, everything was 100 per cent water damaged. “The bishop put aside some money for us to go out and replace some clothes that we’d lost and they had passed round a calendar to mark down days to provide meals. “It is strange how a disaster brings the best out of people. Like in journalism and when I was in the police force, you often see the absolute worst in some people that are out there, so it is nice to see the other side of human nature. “We have nice neighbours and friends within our church community that have really helped to restore our faith in humanity.

Lewis Massie, 20, was giving evidence at the trial of Dean Reynolds, who is accused of killing Michael “Mikey” McLean, 17, at Denholm MacNamee, Aberdeenshire. Lewis had been working with Mikey and Reynolds, 23, in the paint tent on August 14, 2015, but left before the incident. He told the High Court in Aberdeen Mikey had gone inside a giant spooler drum - – a large machine used to lower cables into the sea from oil platforms - they were refurbishing to start painting it. Reynolds is alleged to have operated the machine at while Michael was inside the drum of the spooler. Richard Goddard, prosecuting, asked Lewis, of Keith, Banffshire, if there were any plans to “carry out pranks for Mikey on his last day”. Lewis said he wasn’t aware of any, adding: “Dean isn’t really a practical joker.”  On the first day of the trial on Wednesday, a witness told of the moment he came across the injured schoolboy. Brian Ritchie, managing director of Denholm MacNamee, said he rushed to the scene after a staff member told him Michael McLean, 17, was “unconscious”. Brian, 49, said: “I thought he was dead. He was blueish-white and bleeding from the ear.” Earlier, Dean Reynolds, who denies the culpable homicide of Michael, told the court that the teenager might have “choked on his chewing gum”. Michael died in hospital six days after sustaining “severe” injuries in the drum of the massive cable spooling machine at the oil industry services firm. The first day of Reynolds’s trial on Wednesday heard that Michael was working at the firm – where his dad was a procurement manager – and was on his last day on Friday August 14, 2015, before he was due to return to school. But at 12.20pm that day, bosses were alerted to an “emergency” in a paint shed at the yard in Inverurie Business Park, Aberdeenshire.

A shocking video emerged of two women known as \u0027Black Juicy\u0027 and Lizzie in a physical fight, with kicks and punches being thrown around. One of them was pushed to the floor as they screamed at each other and threw around names such as s**t. A coffee cup, which reportedly contained Jim Beam whisky, was also hurled. It was unclear what caused the bizarre altercation in Shildon, County Durham on Sunday afternoon.  But according to the Daily Mail , the women are actually good friends who had a fall out after an all-day drinking session for bank holiday.   The pair were named as Lyndsey Stewart, 27, and Joanne Heckles, 41, who is a grandmother nicknamed \u0027Black Juicy\u0027. Reports said they\u0027d been drinking whiskey before the fight, which was captured on camera by John Canty. But apparently the violence didn\u0027t come between them and they\u0027re still friends. They said they\u0027d never fought before and blamed the booze. A neighbour said the pair were embarrassed about what happened.   A spokeswoman from Durham Police told  a 41-year-old woman was arrested but released without charge.  She said: Police were called to Albion Avenue, Shildon, following reports of two women fighting in the street on Sunday, May 27. One woman was arrested on suspicion of assault however no further action has been taken. Footage of the incident was viewed more than 1.5 million times in 24 hours after it was published on social media.  In the video, the brunette woman, Black Juicy, stands at the door of her house shouting at the blonde female, Lizzie. Lizzie then lifts up her pink strapless playsuit to show her bottom to Black Juicy and mockingly twerks in front of her. In response to this, Black Juicy shouts at Lizzie and calls her a s**t, an utter s**t before picking up her mug of tea. Lizzie then hurls inaudible abuse at Black Juicy and pushes her with both of her hands into her house.  Black Juicy retaliates and throws her mug of tea at Lizzie\u0027s face, who manages to kung-fu punch the cup away from her face. This astonishing feat is shown in slow motion again in the video. The two women then return to physically fighting each other and slap each other in the face. Black Juicy then grabs Lizzie by her pig-tails, putting her in a headlock whilst the two continue punching each other. As the drama continues, Lizzie falls onto the street and as she does this, Black Juicy briefly forgets about her and starts shouting at a neighbour, saying: I\u0027m sick of you.

A lot has changed since our first meeting in Manchester back in 1868. Over the last century and a half we’ve won millions of workers the right to paid holidays, the minimum wage and safer workplaces. As we like to say, it was the unions which brought you the weekend. But make no mistake, working people need unions today as much as ever. One in nine UK workers is now trapped in an insecure job.  Zero-hours contracts, low-paid self-employment and agency work are making working lives a whole lot harder. Everyone deserves a decent job they can build a life on. But that’s impossible if you don’t know where your next shift or pay cheque is coming from. My message to bad bosses is this: we’re on your case. Our movement is still nearly six million-strong – from nurses and checkout assistants to lorry drivers and airline pilots. And we still believe that the strong should help the weak. The world of work may have changed. But we will continue to fight \u0026shyexploitation.

Adam Gonzales has baffled doctors after forgetting wife Raquel and their three children - before incredibly regaining a few years worth of memories three months later. Adam, 40, and Raquel met in December of 2012. They fell in love and blended their families, getting married July 7, 2015 in Gilbert, Arizona. But early one morning in September 2016 Raquel walked into their living room to find her husband looking perplexed and seemed to have no idea who she was. I asked him: \u0027Do you know where you are? Do you know what year this is? Do you know what my name is?\u0027 And he said \u0027No\u0027 to all these things, Raquel said.  As she tried to reassure him and told him she was his wife and they had three children together he burst into tears. Raquel told him to get dressed and told him they needed to go to hospital immediately. As he went to get his clothes he questioned where his suits were - Raquel explained that he didn\u0027t have any suits and that he was a personal trainer. Adam reluctantly followed a woman he believed was a complete stranger to hospital where he began a a long journey of tests - MRIs, CAT scans, echocardiograms - but they could not work out what had happened.  Incredibly three months later in December 2016 - Adam woke up and remembered who Raquel was again before apologising for something that had happened three years earlier, when they were still dating. But his memories had seemed to return from much earlier in their relationship - and when their children were younger, Raquel said. She said at one point he went see if his daughter was ready for school and she was much older than he remembered. He had to be directed to his children\u0027s school before he asked his daughter to put their home address into the GPS so he wouldn\u0027t get lost. He is slowly recovering memories but three years are still missing, including some important milestones, such as his wedding to Raquel. On their GoFundMe page they wrote: Adam is now home, with his wife and family, but has no recollection of 2012 - 2016. This includes his wedding day, daddy-daughter dances, vacations, baptisms, and other key events, along with his career as a personal trainer.  Adam and Raquel are beginning to date and rebuild their “new” lives together but the road ahead will be long and full of challenges for the whole family, which includes 3 amazing teenagers. But this wasn\u0027t the first time Adam had lost several years of his life. After the break-up of his first marriage, he started a new relationship, but it became abusive and ended when she strangled him with an electric cord and left him dead in his garage. As he was rushed to hospital his heart stopped threes times and then spent four months in a coma.  At the time of the incident in 2011 he had been a branch manager for telecoms giant AT\u0026ampT and a devoted church leader in Lubbock, Texas. But he didn\u0027t remember any of that. Adam told The BBC he didn\u0027t remember who his two children were from his previous marriage and had no idea he had even been married and then divorced. He spent a year in hospital learning to walk and talk again and it was a few months before he was introduced to his son and daughter again. How could a father, a dad, forget his biological children? he said.  He decided not to go back to his old job over fear of not being able to live up to this person that he didn\u0027t even know. So he moved moved to Phoenix, Arizona, with his children, and became a personal trainer. That was where he met Raquel in 2012 and after a few months of dating Raquel and her daughter and Adam and his son and daughter moved in together. But their lives dramatically changed in September two years ago when he forgot who Raquel and their kids were. Abby was 12, Lulu was 15 and Elijah was 17 when Adam\u0027s second memory loss occurred in 2016.

Hospital clerical worker Eoin O’Faodhagain from Donegal took a ten minute video from the Loch Ness webcam. The creature moves from right to left and as it swims towards Urquhart Bay - a favourite haunt of Nessie - and is seen diving and surfacing with water splashes. The sighting - the second record accepted this year by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register - comes only days before DNA sampling is to be used to discover previously unrecorded organisms in Loch Ness. Eoin, 53, from Drumdoit Castlefin has wached the Nessie webcam for many years. “I just click in now and then for 20 minutes - it’s better than watching Coronation Street,” he said. “I seen a couple of things over the years but they have been explained as a boat or something else.” But on April 30, Eoin had “a terrific shock.”  “I couldn’t believe my eyes,” he said. I just started recording it on my phone. I just followed it.  It was very unusual, it was certainly something big - it dived down and up again and dived and disappeared. It was not a boat and not a log. I would say it was Nessie. “I believe in Nessie but not as a plesiosaur - but as something that has evolved in Loch Ness over thousands of years.” Mr O’Faodhagain has been to Loch Ness four times as part of Highland holidays. Gary Campbell, Keeper of the Official Register of Sightings at Loch Ness, said: As far as Nessie footage goes this is a feature film.  Normally you only get videos of one of two seconds. It is remarkable in its length and again shows the increased sightings of Nessie from the internet. “Clearly it is something that dives in and out of the surface with water splashes and reflections. It is unexplained. The object would be no larger than 20ft. There is something there on the video that is clearly moving.”  Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster set new global records last year. Nessie’s 11 accepted sightings in 2017 were the highest this century. Irish missionary St Columba is first said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD. Since then there have been 1080 officially logged sightings. This month a team of scientists will collect tiny fragments of skin and scales from the loch. Prof Neil Gemmell, a New Zealand scientist leading the project, said he did not believe in Nessie, but was confident of finding genetic codes for other creatures. He said a “biological explanation” might be found to explain some of the stories about the Loch Ness Monster. Maybe there’s a biological explanation for some of the stories,” he said.

The bizarre image was caused by a perfect alignment of the pictures from two very, very different shows on the TV streaming service.  The top photo is for a show called The Royals, using the iconic snap of Kate and Wills kissing on their wedding day, with the bride looking stunning in her white dress and veil.

Shay Moloney and Jack Kenneally are believed to have gone for a swim in a lake with friends after a study period. One of the boys got into difficulty while swimming from one bank to the other at the quarry in Knockanean, Co Clare, Ireland, it is understood.  The other teen then swam out to help him but also got into trouble, and both disappeared under the surface, the Irish Mirror reports.   Onlookers on the shore raised the alarm at around 3.30pm on Thursday and a major rescue operation was launched to rescue the Junior Cert students. One local man said: “When I heard the sirens and saw the helicopter my heart just sank. “I knew it was the quarry. I just knew it wasn’t good. “The helicopter was on the ground for a good hour and took off towards Limerick. It’s awful altogether.”  A number of signs are posted at the quarry warning people not to go swimming in the lake. Three units of the fire brigade from Ennis, including members of their swift water rescue unit, responded along with a number of Garda teams. The Shannon-based Irish Coast Guard helicopter, Rescue 115, was quickly scrambled along with the Kilkee unit of the Coast Guard. Clare Civil Defence also responded to the incident.  Fire crews quickly located the first casualty lying on rocks below the surface. The second boy was found just a few metres away. A former firefighter tried to dive down and reach one of the casualties but was unable to grab hold of him. Despite several desperate attempts to reach the boy, he was left exhausted.  A local man raced to the scene with his diving equipment and recovered both boys to the surface. Fire personnel assisted the diver with recovering the casualties from the water and helped ambulance paramedics with CPR. A young man arrived at the scene in an agitated state wanting to enter the area. He shouted: “I want to find my cousin.” The distressed teenager was calmed and comforted by gardai and persuaded to leave the area while emergency services carried out their duties.  Gardai, fire service and Civil Defence personnel attended the scene while officers travelled to the homes of the young men to advise their families of what had happened. A Garda crime scene investigation unit technician also attended and recovered several bags of personal belongings. A Garda spokesman said: “We believe there were a number of young people swimming in the area during the afternoon. Two got into difficulty and the alarm was raised. All the services responded and two casualties were recovered from the water.” A number of signs are visible in the area all warning people not to swim in the quarry.

CCTV footage shows the gang taking Nong Gift, 21, out of the bar where she had been watching the Champions League final with friends last Saturday in Chanthaburi, Thailand. The cosmetics seller passed out inside the pub - with relatives claiming she had been drugged - and was carried out at 2am and put in the back of a pick-up truck by four men who it\u0027s said claimed they would take her home. But the men - including one who is said to have known her - drove her to a secluded orchard where she was \u0027repeatedly raped\u0027 before being beaten to death.  The gang - Nattaphong Saenkraud, 24, Patti Boonthal, 23, Panya Chan Somdee, 18, and Surasit Jaechim, 24 - are reported to have confessed their involvement to police. On Wednesday they were taken on a crime re-enactment. CCTV shows them - with the help of a female friend of Nong who is said to be the one who thought the group would take her home - carrying her out of the Orbit Pub and putting her into the back of a truck. Police Major General Charn Jitjunjun said: The victim was found dead on the same night. Four men have been arrested and confessed to their part in the crime. The victim was raped by four people and we believe beaten until she died. Her body was found with foam around her mouth, a nose bleed and part of her clothes on the floor.\u0027  A devastated friend who had been with Nong earlier in the evening said she had left her with the group of men because she thought they were her friends. There were also women in the group when she left including the woman who helped to carry Nong into the truck. Airziz Opachat, who left at 1.40am some 30 minutes before her friend passed out, said: I\u0027m sorry. If we knew that last night was the last time we were together. I will take care of you better. I\u0027m sorry I did not take care of you better. Nong had been with three other women while watching the football match but only knew one of them, Airziz Opachat, well, according to local media. They had been on holiday together in the past and socialised regularly, it was reported. The other girls all left earlier in the evening and Airziz said that Nong didn\u0027t seem very drunk. She added: Nong already knew one of the men. She was friendly with everyone. It was normal for her to be out chatting with people.  I thought that she had arrived with these men and was friends with them. Between us we had all drank about half a bottle of whiskey. I woke up in the morning and didn\u0027t see any message from Nong. The only message was from a man that said \u0027your friend is dead\u0027. Nong\u0027s body was found in the fruit processing area. The four men were arrested later on Sunday, May 27, afternoon after police viewed CCTV and tracked them down. During the crime re-enactment the four men were taken to the bar, shown loading a woman into their truck and taken to warehouse at the orchard where the attack happened. One of the group, Surasit Jaechim, the man who knew her, claims he only drove her and the other men to the area where she was killed. All men have been held in custody. Police are now carrying out post mortem examinations on Nong\u0027s body to discover whether she was drugged and the exact cause of her death.

That was a major factor in coming here,” is how the left-back put it.And he was convinced that will be the case after a chat with United assistant boss Laurie Ellis.The pair know each other, having been team-mates at Raith Rovers during the 2013-14 campaign.“I knew Laurie pretty well from my time at Raith. We got speaking about the prospect (of joining United). Since then it has gone pretty quickly.“Coming to a club like Dundee United is really a pretty simple choice.”Ironically, with new Morton boss Ray McKinnon considering a move for his old work-mate Ellis, it could be the pair don’t end up working together again next season.If United can persuade their highly regarded coach to stay, McKinnon could team up with another of his former Tannadice backroom staff, Darren Taylor.Returning to Booth, after a year spent vainly scrapping to avoid the drop, the ex-Hibs, Arbroath and Brechin man is looking forward to a challenge at the right end of a table.“Last season was tough and we just couldn’t get away from that drop zone,” he added.“This will be a different type of pressure, being expected to win most weeks and one which I will relish.”Booth will battle for the left-back slot with youngster Jamie Robson, who himself last week signed up for another two years at Tannadice.Manager Csaba Laszlo is pleased to have that kind of competition in the squad and to get a man of Booth’s quality and experience.“I’m delighted to bring Callum to Dundee United,” he said.“He is an experienced left-back who has played in the Premiership. Callum will create competition on the left side of our defence and improves the squad. He is a defender who likes to get up the park and helps create attacking situations.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/5abe00fa671c1-848x564.jpg

October 2017.And now she has been nominated as Nail Technician of the Year at the Scottish Beauty Industry awards which will be announced on June 17.It all started nine years ago when Jennifer undertook a nail technician diploma in Glasgow.Jennifer said: “Beauty was something I was always into and after completing my diploma I did nails part time.“About five years ago I started my own business at home then started renting spaces in salons.”In 2016 Jennifer was diagnosed with breast cancer but still carried on creating her nail masterpieces from her home when she felt well enough.Thankfully in June 2017 Jennifer was given the all clear and was determined to get back into the beauty industry.“My friend used to have her salon in premises in Blackness Road and when she outgrew the space she told me to take over the lease,” she said.“I decided to go for it and I opened the salon a few weeks ago with an amazing team behind me.“Having been unwell for such a long time I

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ray mckinnon aims to lure dundee united assistant laurie ellis to morton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon’s first act as Morton manager could be to raid former employers Dundee United for the services of assistant boss Laurie Ellis.Out of work since being sacked by the Tangerines in October, McKinnon has beaten off stiff competition from an impressive list of candidates to be named as Ton boss on Wednesday.And it’s understood he wants to team up with Ellis for a third time.The pair worked together at Raith Rovers for a season and then moved to Tannadice in 2016.Although McKinnon was dismissed with United five points off the top of the Championship, Ellis’s services were retained and he was appointed caretaker manager.During that period he actually led them back to the top of the league and was approached by several senior member of the team who urged him to apply for the manager’s job on a permanent basis.He declined because at this stage of his coaching career he felt he lacked the experience to be in charge of a club the size of United and resumed his duties as No 2 when Csaba Laszlo was appointed in November.Despite big changes to both the playing squad and backroom staff at Tannadice being planned this summer, including the expected appointment of Csaba’s long-time assistant Werner Burger, it’s understood Ellis has been told he’ll continue to have an important role working with the first team.He may, though, find the chance to team up again with his close friend McKinnon very difficult to turn down.United, meanwhile, have appointed a new head of finance in the shape of chartered accountant Iain Ross.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/11/59fc45c3606dd-846x564.jpg ","title":"ray mckinnon has no regrets over his spell at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon insists he does not have a point to prove to former club Dundee United after taking over at Greenock Morton.The 47-year-old was axed as Tannadice boss back in October with his side five points adrift of eventual Ladbrokes Championship winners St Mirren.But the man who replaced him, Csaba Laszlo, was unable to inspire the Tangerines to better, with his side crashing out of the promotion battle in the play-off semi-finals.But McKinnon insists his only motivation for taking up his new role at Cappielow is to guide Ton to the Premiership.McKinnon \u0026#8211 who has been handed a one-year rolling deal by chairman Crawford Rae \u0026#8211 said: \u0026#8220After six months out I was getting extremely bored \u0026#8211 there is only so much you can do in the house.\u0026#8220But I\u0026#8217m delighted to be back.

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users.

A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

I adored Neale Cooper, the player, the person, the voracious lover of life.This has been a hard week, the first few days of which were lost to mourning.Neale’s death hit me far, far harder than I could possibly have imagined even given the huge affection I had for him.You too?This time last year when I was a fellow speaker at the Newtonhill FC dinner in Altens, he had me in tears of helpless laughter despite him having only been released from hospital a couple of days earlier after terrible leg pain.\u0026mdash Graham Hunter (@BumperGraham) May 28, 2018In January we were out in a good group of characters, including Craig Brown and Jim Leighton, enjoying the pleasures of a spot of karaoke in McNastys.And a few weeks ago I was a go-between for the possibility of a job for Tattie in Poland at Lechia Gdansk.He’d had a chance of working in Thailand thanks to contacts with Stevie Nicol so the Poland thing passed to Lee McCulloch.But Neale told me that he was “desperate to get back to coaching”.Working in Spain has allowed me access and, in some cases, friendship with great players of my era who’ve won Champions League titles, won the World Cup and all that jazz. I continue to feel privileged.But nothing compared to the thrill of becoming friendly with Tattie.You see, to my fevered mind, he was me.When I was a little kid in Bieldside, his mum and dad, before Mr Cooper’s sudden and awfully sad death from a heart attack, owned the local shop.I didn’t know it at the time but Neale and I were apparently classmates for a while.Once his father died he moved on to Airyhall and Hazlehead but whenever Neale would meet my dad at Pittodrie, which was often, he’d ask after life in Barcelona and tell GH senior that: “I was at school with Graham, you know!”If he was briefly at Cults Primary then I’m honoured.But even though we then didn’t meet properly until the late, great, much-mourned Champers nightclub in the early 1980s (each of us with a curly dyed-blond mop of Harpo Marx hair by then), Tattie seemed to me, and to my pals who frequented Pittodrie, as “one of us”.My time in Barcelona has coincided with watching the mega-emotion generated when footballers born and trained locally achieve greatness for the club they support.The jaw-dropping adoration for Fernando Torres at Atleti wasn’t simply because he won titles for Spain.Remember, he didn’t even win a trophy with Atleti until this year’s minute-long appearance in the Europa League final in Lyon.He was utterly loved because he was the embodiment of the fans, the guy who made it. The hero who loved Atleti JUST as much as they did.Raúl felt it at Madrid. Xavi and Puyol at Barça.I understood, all these years, because (just like Simmy and Johnny Hewitt) Super Cooper was the anointed Aberdonian.He loved the Dandies just as much as we did, he loved a night out at least as much as we did, he had a character which told him that he could devour the world and if it was big Doug Rougvie who became indelibly linked with “let’s go to Glasgow and stick it to them at Ibrox and Parkhead”, all of us knew that the whole team felt that way. But to Neale it was second nature. Nothing daunted him, not even another row from furious Fergie.If you’ve had a lockie-in at the Bielder, drank Tequila Sunrises until 2am, got up at 5am to get on a bus to Hampden, gone 1-0 down to a John Submarine MacDonald goal and then seen the afternoon climaxed by Tattie ramming the ball into an empty net for 4-1 before doing his somersault celebration at the Rangers end, then you instantly know: he is ME!An incredible athlete, fabulous footballer, belligerent, team-spirited – all of this we could see. But it took me until my journalistic life to find out that Tattie was the funniest man on the planet.Everyone, literally everyone, you meet who knew him will have stories about him (either that he told or that he caused) which reduce them to helpless, happy mirth.Cling on to those, folks. It’s one way Nealie will live with us forever.His story about Fergie and the one-ball-bowled cricket game at Gordonstoun did it for me. The one he told me in January about the side effects to his heart-stent and his proposed remedies did too.One day Gary McAllister and I were waiting to chat to Steven Gerrard on a big film set where Adidas were shooting a major kit launch advert. The great man was in his trailer getting made up so Gary filled the time with a “Tattie tale”.Gary Mac had seen that Aston Villa hadn’t been a great place for Neale thanks to a car theft and a house break-in. So he decided to call round one day, only to discover, several streets away, that his route was via an increasing tide of water. As he got nearer Chez Tattie he, of course, found that Neale had gone to training with the bath still running and so bad was the flood that a basket full of kittens, plus garden accoutrements and detritus from Neale’s house, floated past him.And by the time our hero was home, he was happier to see Gary Mac than he was upset about the soaking house.It was for these, and about a million other, reasons that I decided to call Real Madrid on Monday night.Their win in Kiev meant that Neale \u0026amp Co remain the last to beat Madrid in a Uefa knock-out competition final – 35 years later.Emilio Butragueño couldn’t have been quicker, nicer or more sincere about: “While Madrid can’t routinely do this for the hundreds of thousands of those who’ve played against us … Neale and Aberdeen were a special case.”Hence their letter to Stewart Milne, our beloved club and the Cooper family about this beloved man.Truly, a special case. Even Real Madrid knew. Viva Tattie Cooper.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country.

They are dedicated to their craft, and I am extremely grateful for their continued support and wish them all the best of luck.\u0026#8217Supported by Royal Bank of Scotland, the 178th Royal Highland Show will take place at the Royal Highland Centre, Ingliston, Edinburgh, on June 21-24.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr roundabout named among uks","story":"NewsAyr roundabout named among UK\u0027s worstWhitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:14, 28 MAY 2018NewsWhitletts roundabout is one of the most dangerous in the UK (Image: IAIN BROWN)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA roundabout branded ‘Witless’ for striking fear into drivers has been named among the UK’s worst. Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The pair are both from Kilmarnock. “We met in the Brass \u0026amp Granite in 2010 at a pub quiz,” said Erin. “I worked part time in Tesco while studying and Stuart would come in and chat to me on a Sunday when he wasn’t offshore. “It wasn’t until 2015 when my gran met Stuart at a wedding and told him that I was single that he finally plucked up the courage to ask me on a date! “Stuart invited me to his house where he cooked me a lovely meal and the romance started. We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

possible, and that there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\nSinn Fein accused Mr Davis of trying to \u0026ldquohide a hard border in a buffer zone.\nMEP Martina Anderson

Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and Northern trains have been cancelled or delayed by more than 30 minutes since new schedules were introduced on May 20.\nMr Khan described the performance of GTR \u0026ndash which operates in south-east England \u0026ndash as \u0026ldquonothing short of a debacle and \u0026ldquowholly unsatisfactory.\nIn a letter to Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, Mr Khan said he would be \u0026ldquototally supportive of a decision to strip GTR of its franchise immediately.\n\u0026ldquoPassengers have had enough of excuses and a lack of accountability, the mayor stated.\nHe also wrote to GTR chief executive Charles Horton, urging him to give Londoners \u0026ldquoa detailed account of how these problems are going to be resolved.\nOn Friday GTR \u0026ndash which consists of Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express \u0026ndash saw almost one in 10 (9%) of its trains either cancelled or more than 30 minutes late by 2pm.\nThe punctuality record of Northern was even worse on Friday, with 17% of trains cancelled or more than 30 minutes late.\nThis included every train on the Lakes Line between Windermere and Oxenholme.\nBritain\u0026rsquos rail timetable is updated twice a year, but the latest version has many more changes than normal in a bid to improve punctuality and account for extra services and capacity following billions of pounds of investment.\nThe timing of all GTR and most Northern trains was changed, but all the new journeys needed to be individually approved by Government-owned Network Rail, which is responsible for managing infrastructure.\nNetwork Rail, GTR and Northern apologised to passengers, blaming the \u0026ldquosheer number of changes and late-running engineering projects for a delay in approving the new timetables and making amendments.\nThis meant train companies had \u0026ldquomuch less time to prepare.\nThere were fresh \u0026ldquologistical challenges and driver training requirements caused by the alterations to the schedules submitted to Network Rail.\nMr Grayling has claimed the rail industry \u0026ldquofailed the passengers it serves.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new
