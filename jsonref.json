That is not a decision the UK Government could take, it would require the consent of all 27 member states.\u0027It would also generate some very practical issues, for example EU parliamentary elections at the end of May.\u0027He continued: \u0027The real question for Members of Parliament who voted to give the public a say through the European referendum in 2016, who voted in large numbers to trigger Article 50, (is) the consequence of triggering Article 50 is you either have a deal and the EU have been clear that the only deal on the table is the PM\u0027s deal.

The over-subscription criteria are different for every school so checking before your apply could save time and heartache.’The advice comes at a time when competition for places is fierce following a baby boom which has created pressure in built-up areas such as London and Birmingham.Children can often end up in under-subscribed schools rated ‘inadequate’ or ‘requires improvement’ by Ofsted, which usually puts parents off.These schools may also have more challenging intakes, such as a high proportion of pupils on free school meals or still learning English.Mrs Coatman said that if a child ends up in a school which is not right for them it could have far-reaching consequences for their education.          The tips form part of an advice sheet released today by the Guide in advance of the deadline for applying for a primary school next Tuesday (stock image)‘Bright children can feel very frustrated if they don’t get challenging work,’ she explained.‘If behaviour in the class is poor, well-behaved kids can get neglected. Very able or “odd” kids can get bullied.’Mrs Coatman said a ‘safe bet’ school would be one with a large intake which has in previous years accepted children living a similar distance away.She also warned: ‘Ambitious parents think a school that isn’t “outstanding” or “good” wouldn’t be worth considering - but there are several outstanding schools that haven’t been inspected for over a decade.’She advised parents missing out on all their choices to accept the first school offered, then sign up to the waiting lists of their chosen schools.‘Try not to let on to your child how much you hate the school at which they’ve been given a place. Your child may feel they’re starting a seven-year sentence.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Councils enjoy surge parking charge profits slashing spending crumbling roads","story":"    Councils’ parking profit includes all the money they make from on-street parking, car parks, parking permits and parking fines, minus the amount they spend on providing the services and on enforcement.

In effect that could force no-deal Brexit, frustrating the resistance from cross-party Remainers.However, the government would still be in place - and the civil service is allowed to continue implementing pre-existing policy.The move would spark a constitutional crisis, Cabinet resignations and leave MPs up in arms. But one Cabinet minister who supports the plan told MailOnline ignoring the will of Parliament would be justified to avoid \u0027destroying the last bit of faith in politics\u0027.‘The public are saying, “just f***ing get on with it”,\u0027 they said.QUENTIN LETTS: Yvette Cooper warned voters in No Deal...Share this article    Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, if a no-confidence motion is passed, there is a 14 day period in which the government - or a new administration - can try to establish a majority again‘Failing to make Brexit happen would destroy the last bit of faith in politics.‘It is either this deal or no deal, those are the only two choices.‘If Tory Remainers threaten to join a no confidence vote, the PM should use her power to set the date of the election. \u0027And she should set it for April 4, after Brexit happens. There would be nothing Parliament could do.’ Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, if a no-confidence motion is passed, there is a 14 day period in which the government - or a new administration - can try to establish a majority again.If a confidence motion is not passed by MPs during that time then an election is triggered.But the legislation sets out that the date of the national ballot will be \u0027the day appointed by Her Majesty by proclamation on the recommendation of the Prime Minister\u0027.The minister pointed out that, while Parliament is dissolved for 17 working days during a campaign, the government still exists, and the civil service can still carry out pre-existing policies. Asked what Mrs May should do if ministers opt to quit, they said: ‘Say bye bye. \u0027The Brexiteers who didn’t agree with the policy quit. They should do the same.’           Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd (pictured at No10 yesterday) has warned a government that pushed through no-deal would not be forgiven    Tory Dominic Grieve (left) and Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper (right) are among the MPs who have joined forces to try to head off the possibility of a no-deal BrexitThe Cabinet minister added that they believed Mrs May was committed to making Brexit happen.‘The PM has not shown any signs of wavering so far,’ they said.A crucial Commons debate will resume later today on the Prime Minister\u0027s blueprint - paving the way for a titanic showdown next week that could define the country\u0027s future.But the walls are closing in on Mrs May after an alliance of Labour and Conservative rebels inflicted an historic defeat on the flagship Finance Bill - the first time that has happened for four decades.The amendment will curb the Treasury\u0027s tax-raising powers if the government tries to force a no deal Brexit, with rebels insisting they will wage \u0027guerrilla warfare\u0027 to stop the UK crashing out without an agreement. The Cabinet is also deeply split on how to proceed if Mrs May\u0027s package is killed off, with figures such as Amber Rudd and Greg Clark adamant that no-deal should not be contemplated, while others such as Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt and Andrea Leadsom are thought to regard it as preferable to no Brexit.Mrs May - who has insisted she will not delay the Brexit date from the end of March - has effectively admitted the EU has not given her any new concessions by resuming the debate she delayed last month, rather than tabling a fresh motion.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Girl wearing VR headset runs straight wall drops grenade California","story":"    A girl wearing a virtual reality headset runs head-first into a wall after dropping a grenade in her friend\u0027s game          She tentatively holds the sensor pads while listening to instructions from her friends          The girl then accidentally tosses a grenade at her own feet while playing the firs-person shooterVirtual reality can make you a better person: Study finds...Share this articleRicardo Gonhin had invited his female friend round to try out his VR games for the first time.Another woman could be seen helping the girl put the headset on and placing the sensor controllers in her hands.The man and woman try to coach her through playing the game.

In Byzantine times, the historian Eusebius said that Kirjathjearim was nine or ten miles west of Jerusalem, which this site is.\u0027Also the name of the hill in Arabic – Deir el-Azar – preserves the name of the Byzantine monastery: the Monastery of Elazar.\u0027According to the Book of Samuel, Elazar was the priest in charge of the Ark.\u0027Along with his colleagues, Thomas Romer and Christophe Nicoll of the College de France, Professor Finkelstein has been digging at Kiryat Ye\u0027arim since August 2017 as part of the Shmunis Family Excavation.And though he has found no evidence of the Ark itself, he believes he can shed some light on its true nature.          Professor Finkelstein of Tel Aviv University is leading the dig at the site along with other experts          The colossal structure is not the final resting place of the lost Ark but thought to be a temple which lends vital clues as to why the narrative was constructed          The site of the temple platform in the steppes above what is now the modern Israeli town of Kiryat Ye\u0027arimKirjathjearim straddled the border of two ancient kingdoms – Israel to the north and Judah to the south – with excavations suggesting the site was used by the former to control the latter.Against this backdrop, Professor Finkelstein believes the Ark story was invented to give Kirjathjearim religious legitimacy as an administrative centre.It also emphasises a fabled past when the two kingdoms were united under a single ruler, further legitimising ancient Israel\u0027s rule over its southern neighbour.\u0027We are not searching for the Ark,\u0027 he said. \u0027We are trying to understand the Ark Narrative: who composed it, when and why.\u0027The biblical narrative probably comes from the Northern Kingdom (Israel) and was seemingly composed in the first half of the 8th century BC.\u0027It probably served the ideological goals of the kingdom at the time, perhaps also its territorial aspirations, namely control over Judah.\u0027Lending weight to this theory is a huge platform discovered at the site.          Moses and Joshua bowing before the Ark of the Covenant, which was believed to be kept at the ancient site of Kirjathjearim          The ancient and sacred site of Kirjathjearim is believed by historians to be the located in the same place as the modern Israeli town of Kiryat Ye\u0027arim          The archaeologists believe their discovery of a colossal temple platform lends weight to their theories about the biblical narrative and why the Ark of the Covenant was said to have been located thereProfessor Finkelstein said: \u0027Kirjathjearim was a typical hill country town, on a peak, with relatively steep slopes.\u0027But on the summit there was an elevated platform, which was probably the location of a temple.\u0027He believes Judah was too weak to have constructed the platform itself and thinks the likeliest builder was the occupying Northern Kingdom.If he\u0027s right, it would prove the kingdom\u0027s influence over the site.Biblical tradition says that the Ark was eventually brought from Kirjathjearim to Jerusalem, but disappeared when the city was destroyed by Babylonians in the sixth century BC.Its whereabouts have been the subject of speculation since, with some saying it may have been melted down for gold, hidden on Mount Nebo, Jordan, or even taken to Africa.The site is rumoured to have been the inspiration behind the 1981 blockbuster, Raiders of the Lost Ark."},{"url":null,"title":"Curious cats jump skins toy car suddenly moves","story":"The cats can be seen looking intently at the toy car (left) but after one of the kitten\u0027s touches it, they all jump back scared (right)Antifreeze poisoner is suspected of killing SIX cats...Dog owner who overfed his Staffordshire bull terriers so...Share this articleWhen the kittens calmed down, the intrepid animal which first touched the toy makes its way over to the car again to take it for another spin. The four cats are part of a family of 12 who belong to Michelle, who lives in Japan.She posts videos and pictures on her Instagram page 12 Cats Lady, showing the day-to-day lives of the adorable brood. Michelle, who described herself on Instagram as a \u0027mother of 12 floofs\u0027, told Daily Mail Australia her love of felines started when she found an abandoned cat on the street.

With the publication of her second YA novel coming up next month, here’s your chanceAngie Thomas is the author of the bestseller The Hate U Give, a novel for young adults that was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and which tells the story of Starr Carter, a 16-year-old African American girl who is drawn to activism after witnessing the police shooting of a childhood friend. Published in 2017, the book has been on the New York Times young adult bestseller list for 96 weeks and has won many awards, including children’s book of the year at the British book awards, and the Waterstones children’s book prize for 2018. Writer Nikesh Shukla described it as “one of the most important books of 2017” and it has also recently been made into a successful film.Thomas grew up in Jackson, Mississippi, and she was the first black student to graduate in creative writing from the city’s Belhaven University. Her second book On the Come Up, published in February, is a love letter to hip-hop and tells the story of Bri, a teenager who dreams of becoming the greatest rapper of all time. Thomas was a rapper as a teenager.We are offering readers the chance to put a question to the award-winning author: submit them in the comments section below, email us at review@observer, or tweet @ObsNewReview by 10am on Monday 14 January. Here are some Angie Thomas quotes to inspire you...“I grew up in a neighbourhood called Georgetown, which is the ’hood...I would hear gunshots at night… but one thing I did love about my neighbourhood growing up was the sense of community.”“When I couldn’t find myself in books, I found myself in the rhymes written by MCs who looked like me and shared my experiences.”“I’ve always seen writing as a form of activism. If nothing else, books give us a glimpse into lives that we may not have known about before they can promote empathy.”“Freedom of speech isn’t necessarily free, especially when you’re young and black.”“Every time a black girl comes up to me and says, ‘Thank you. It’s the first time I’ve seen myself in a book like this’, that’s better than hitting the New York Times bestseller list.”“Hashtags are nice, but I would ask people to put in some work! You know, organise! Speak out! Do things! Be active about it! Don’t just put that hashtag and ignore it. We can make change happen if we actually speak out and do things and work…”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e060f82ce815c08931fddd3bf2e053ce3ef83ab6/785_964_1952_1171/master/1952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4e461b2c0629fae1959c5b7144f2e14","title":"normal people sally rooney novel literary phenomenon of decade","story":"Booksellers are keeping stashes behind counters, others are having to put signs in windows to say it’s in stock … What is it about the novel that has resonated with so many people?A good measure of a book’s success is: are booksellers tired of being asked if they have it in stock? In one south London bookshop, the owner has put a sign in the window advising that yes, they do have copies of Sally Rooney’s Normal People, the literary phenomenon of the year.This week, Rooney, 27, became the youngest novelist ever to land the Costa awards’ best novel category. Normal People is now favourite to win the prize for overall book of the year at the end of the month. Her second novel has been a surprise – not for its quality, which was assured after her confident debut Conversations with Friends – but for the response to it. There hasn’t been a literary novel that has had such an impact on conversation beyond the usual huddles of luvvies since perhaps Jonathan Franzen’s Freedom, or, before that, Monica Ali’s Brick Lane, or even before that, Zadie Smith’s White Teeth.Booksellers have said they are keeping a stash behind the counter, putting them in the hands of customers before they can even blurt: “Do you have …” Not that they mind it Waterstones staff named it as their favourite book to recommend last year, while one Hatchards bookseller says it was the first book the chain had began to see more commonly sold in multiples, to people eager to share it with friends. I was buying three copies at the time.So why has it become the novel of the moment – and, arguably, the decade? Normal People is a quiet, literary novel – but it is a zeitgeist novel too (despite being set five years ago). It’s hard not to emerge from Rooney’s book about two young people navigating adulthood in post-crash Ireland and sense that, somehow, the author has spotted something intangible about our time and exposed it. Like other zeitgeist novels, from Gone With the Wind, when mass-fiction began booming in the 1930s, to Franzen’s post 911 tome Freedom, Normal People has trapped a moment – in this case, our new sense of collective precariousness – whether inidual, economic or political.It is the first novel I have read that has convincingly captured what it is to be young today: often overeducated, neurotic, slightly too self-aware. So much can be read into the aspiration of the male character Connell to one day “start going to dinner parties and having conversations about the Greek bailout” – a dream for a young man with preconceived ideas about what successful adults do. Or, indeed, to fellow protagonist Marianne’s sense that “her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn’t know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it”.“Hysterical realism” was the name the critic James Wood once gave to the mid-2000s boom of novels ostensibly deliberately setting out to capture the moment. He was not a fan of novels he saw as overstuffed with symbolism and real world events. But what Rooney does differently from Ian McEwan’s Saturday (the Iraq war) or Zadie Smith’s White Teeth (multiculturalism and globalisation) is to ensure it never feels like a lesson.The most compelling question the novel poses is, simply: will Marianne and Connell eventually be happy? In one scene in Normal People, Connell is so engrossed by Jane Austen’s Emma that he loses track of time and, leaving the library, he marvels: “It feels intellectually unserious to concern himself with fictional people marrying one another. But there it is: literature moves him.” There it is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15dc3839800bd11817de42cfcd619cdf2cd2fb30/0_18_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02e27e59cfd3bda2b36678c1527fb256","title":"top 10 quakers in fiction","story":"From magnanimous Mrs Wilcox in Howards End to the bloodthirsty Captain Bildad in Moby-Dick, these portrayals complicate porridge-oat stereotypesMention the Quakers, and often the image that springs to mind is the face of porridge oats: a white-haired man in a wide-brimmed hat. Modern Quakerism, it goes without saying, doesn’t feature many people who look like that – although we still retain a reputation as trustworthy, unpretentious, wholesome and unthreateningly eccentric. Known officially as the Religious Society of Friends, from our Christian beginnings as the “Friends of Light”, the Quakers are a community without a priesthood or an official creed, but believing in truth, peace, simplicity and equality. Because we believe in everyone’s direct, personal experience of God, we don’t have set services instead our worship takes place in unscripted Meetings, where the silence is broken only when someone (and it can be anyone) is inspired to say something.In the light of our high ideals, it can be hard for inidual Quakers not to feel inadequate. I certainly do. We’re exhorted to “let our lives speak”, and I often feel like my life doesn’t have much to say. But I am a writer. As a community that listens patiently for the truth, Quakers provide a unique place for creativity. The faith that can sit through hours of Meeting – through boredom, frustration, distraction – is the same thing that keeps me going when I’m struggling for my next idea. We worship in silence, but we’re waiting for words, which somehow gives me faith that, if I wait in front of a blank page for long enough, the right story will come.It isn’t only our relationship with silence that has shaped my writing. My novel The Binding was deliberately set in an alternative, secularist 19th century, where God doesn’t figure even in oaths. But the book bindery to which the main character, Emmett, is sent is an austere sanctuary that enshrines the Quaker love of a job well done. The binder to whom he’s apprenticed is prickly and plain-speaking, but utterly faithful to her principles and through her wisdom he begins to understand that the only trustworthy moral compass is rigorous compassion. And finally, while I hesitate to claim that my novel is a Quakerly story – it’s shamelessly romantic, indulgent, and a bit too brightly-coloured for that – perhaps its ultimate conclusion is the most Friendly of all: that truth and love are what save us in the end.Here are 10 Quakers in fiction – presented, in the light of our testimony of equality, with no intended hierarchy.1. Honor Bright in The Last Runaway by Tracy ChevalierThere’s a lot to love about Honor Bright, starting with her name. Leaving her family and Quaker Meeting behind her, she travels from England to America to start a new life, where she’s drawn into the Underground Railroad, the network that supported runaway slaves on their way to freedom. Although Honor finds solace in the quiet of Meeting, what really gives her strength is the grace of sincere friendship.2. Ruth Wilcox in Howards End by EM ForsterPerhaps it’s surprising that in this novel it’s not the plain-speaking, free-thinking Schlegel family but the wealthy first Mrs Wilcox who is of Quaker descent. She’s unable to hold her own in discussion and apparently bewildered by social issues, but her decision to leave Howards End to Margaret shows inspired generosity and disregard for social mores.3. The Middleton siblings in Notes from An Exhibition by Patrick GaleA subtle and intelligent depiction of a modern family of “birthright Quakers” as they come to terms with the life and death of their artist mother, this novel conveys the reality of a community of Friends, including the occasional ambivalence of its members. Gale calls Quakerism “mystical but no-nonsense” – an excellent description – and he excels in exploring the interior reality of silent worship.4. The people of the Dusty Miller in The Dazzle of Day by Molly GlossA surprising, lyrical science fiction novel in which a Quaker community sets off to settle a new planet. Told in austere and beautiful prose, the story of the spaceship Dusty Miller has a wonderful scene where the community makes a decision through worship – seeking not consensus but ine guidance – which depicts the way a moment of illumination can emerge unexpectedly from an apparent impasse.5. Sarah Grimké in The Invention of Wings by Sue Monk KiddBased on the real Grimké, a vocal abolitionist and women’s rights campaigner in the 19th-century US, this is a portrait of a woman learning to speak truth to power. Growing up in a slave-owning household, Sarah is struck dumb by the sight of a woman being whipped, and – driven by her relationship with Handful, a slave – she becomes convinced that her ministry is to fight for emancipation. Ironically, in real life she was expelled by her Quaker community for attending her sister’s wedding to an outsider.6. Captain Bildad in Moby-Dick by Herman MelvilleA refreshing counter-example to the upstanding, idealistic Friends that feature elsewhere in this list, Captain Bildad is bitter, hard, avaricious and sanguinary, one of the “fighting Quakers … Quakers with a vengeance”. Opposed to bloodshed in principle, he has nonetheless spent his youth on the spillage of “tuns and tuns of leviathan gore” and retires to enjoy his substantial income.7. The Paxmore family in Chesapeake by James A MichenerThis novel follows the Quaker Paxmores through many generations, beginning in 1661, when Ruth Brinton Paxmore and her husband Edward are imprisoned and tortured for their beliefs. Later, predictably, the family face conflict over slavery and warmongering, but my favourite part of their story is Edward’s development from a carpenter to a shipbuilder – forced to invent a boat from first principles, he fails over and over again before he becomes a true artist.8. May Thornton in Things a Bright Girl Can Do by Sally NichollsIn this touching and funny book for young adults about the suffragist movement and the outbreak of the first world war, May (born to a mother who is not only a Quaker but a vegetarian, Fabian, suffragist, Bolshevik and believer in rational dress for women) is forced to choose between her high principles and her love for Nell, a girl who goes to work in a munitions factory.9. Andrew Raynes in The Charioteer by Mary RenaultA conscientious objector who works in a military hospital, where he falls in love with Laurie, the protagonist, Andrew is endearingly guileless and wholehearted. While a modern audience might wince at the way he has to be “protected” from the realisation of his own homosexuality (the self-knowledge, it’s suggested, might destroy him), Renault does a great job of making this idealistic young man unexpectedly charming.10. Susanna Thorn in No Shame, No Fear by Ann TurnbullA young adult novel set in 1662, this is a love story about Susanna, a Quaker, and Will, the son of a wealthy family. It’s also a vivid evocation of the persecution early Quakers faced, and a reminder that some of what seems quaint now (refusing to doff one’s hat, the use of “thee” to one’s social betters) was once truly radical and subversive.• The Binding by Bridget Collins is published by HarperCollins, priced £12.99.

Greggs made a pretax profit of £81.8m in 2017.Greggs has prided itself on adapting products to suit changing consumer tastes, and said its latest creation, the £1 vegan sausage roll, was proving popular with “a broad range of customers”.The vegan sausage roll hit Greggs’ shelves last week, coinciding with the beginning of Veganuary, a growing movement that encourages people to embrace plant-based diets during January. It is on sale in 950 of Greggs’s 1,950 UK shops. Greggs has increased sales and profits despite a tough backdrop for high street retailers struggling with rising business costs, a switch to online spending and faltering consumer confidence as Brexit looms.Roger Whiteside, the firm’s chief executive, said: “We delivered a very strong finish to 2018 despite the well-publicised challenges in the consumer sector. This performance was broad-based, reflecting the strength of our range of freshly prepared food and drinks, and the strategic changes that we have made in recent years to focus more effectively on the food-on-the-go market.“In the year ahead, we will continue to innovate with products designed to reflect changing consumer tastes, and by opening in new locations that make Greggs even more accessible to customers.”The bakery chain opened 149 new shops in 2018 and closed 50.

A scheduled two days of negotiation was extended by a third day, suggesting things are going well. The arrival of US officials from energy, agriculture and treasury departments is a good sign that discussions are becoming more explicit on topics such as intellectual property and trade deficit.The next step will come at the 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos (22 January), where US President Donald Trump and China Vice-President Wang Qishan will meet.Some good news: unemployment in the euro area has hit a new 10-year low.That still leaves just over 13m people out of work in the euro area, and almost 16.5m in the wider EU (where unemployment is its lowest since Eurostat started counting in 2000).Newsflash: Sales of cars in China fell last year, for the first time in at least 20 years.Such a sharp annual decline is a strong signal that Chinese consumers are being hit by the slowing economy, and by the tariffs imposed by the US last year.It will fuel concerns that China could suffer a hard landing, unless Beijing takes steps to boost domestic demand and there is a significant breakthrough in the trade talks.Sales will also have suffered from the ending of government subsidies for vehicle purchases last year.Fresh from launching a vegan sausage roll to a (mostly) grateful nation, Greggs has hikes its pre-tax profit forecasts from £86m to £88m after a strong end to trading last year.My colleague Angela Monaghan explains how bumper sales of festive bake and mince pies boosted sales:Greggs has prided itself on adapting products to suit changing consumer tastes, and said its latest creation, the £1 vegan sausage roll, was proving popular with “a broad range of customers”.The vegan sausage roll hit Greggs’ shelves last week, coinciding with the beginning of Veganuary, a growing movement that encourages people to embrace plant-based diets during January.

The rest of Europe and Asia also pushed ahead, following similar strength on the US market last night.“Hopes of progress with US-China trade talks are certainly giving markets support, so too a lack of major shocks among corporate trading updates in general.It reassured the City this morning that business looks solid, saying:“We continue to see solid forward sales indicators and start the year with a very strong order book.Analysts have warned that housebuilders would suffer badly from a no-deal Brexit, which could crush consumer confidence, hit growth and potentially force interest rates up to protect the pound.They’ve all suffered from recent US-China tensions last month, China reportedly began cutting tariffs on American-built cars.President Trump is desperate to strike a trade deal with China to drive stocks up again, Bloomberg reports.According to people familiar with the matter, Trump’s willingness to cut a deal with Beijing is driven in large part by his desire for markets to rally.He publicly said he’s eager to make a deal that benefits both sides while also stressing that China’s slowing economy and falling stock market signal the country is more desperate than the U.S. for a speedy outcome.Having made Wall Street’s performance a key measure of his performance, Trump will not have enjoyed last month’s rout -- the worst December since 1931.Today’s rally has driven the FTSE 100 to a four-week high, clawing back December’s losses.Trade deal hopes have sent European stocks higher in early trading.European traders are picking up the baton from their Asia-Pacific colleagues:US officials have also confirmed that the trade negotiations with China are concluding.....and even hinted that they went well.Reuters has the details:The U.S. trade delegation in Beijing is wrapping up meetings with Chinese officials and will return to the United States later on Wednesday, a U.S. official said.Ted McKinney, U.S. Under Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, made the comments to reporters at the delegation’s hotel.“I think they went just fine,” McKinney said of the talks. He declined to answer further questions.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Hopes of a trade agreement between the US and China are gripping the markets today.After three days of negotiations, talks between the two sides in Beijing have just concluded - and there’s real optimism of a breakthrough.China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang has just told a daily news briefing on Wednesday that trade talks have concluded and the results will be released very soon.Lu added that the “longer-than-expected” talks show that China is very serious about getting a deal. Officials had expected to wrap up on Tuesday, but surprised observers by returning to the negotiating table for a third day. Investors are also cheered by reports that Beijing plans new policies to boost domestic demand.Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada explains: Markets have more sugar hits to cheer overnight, helping equities claw back more of their December losses.Reports that China is planning fresh measures to boost domestic consumption have sent shares in large Chinese carmakers and appliance manufacturers higher, though details are scarce.There’s a flurry of Christmas trading updates from UK retailers, including supermarket chain Sainsbury’s, bakers Greggs and Majestic Wine.Economists will also be digesting new trade data from Germany, following a worrying drop in industrial output yesterday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7fed28ce880b5e52d730aa98687dc72cb401c4a/0_267_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3d3462af1c712d66ff5dd0db88adae0","title":"like la with minarets how concrete and cars came to rule tehran","story":"The next 15 megacities #3: With nearly 10 million people doing daily battle with some of the world’s highest levels of congestion and air pollution, headscarves should be the least of the authorities’ worries …by  Oliver Wainwright in TehranTehran’s traffic jams have spawned a curious social phenomenon. The affluent car-driving youth of the northern districts have turned gridlock into a way of meeting members of the opposite sex.Known as “dor-dor” (“turn-turn” in Farsi), separate groups of young men and women drive around, pulling up alongside each other in congested traffic so they can flirt and pass phone numbers through the window. The cars are either all-girl or all-boy to avoid censorship by the Islamic morality police. If the police do show up they can make a (slow) getaway.By 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48. Cities is exploring these newcomers at a crucial period in their development: from car-centric Tehran to the harsh inequalities of Luanda from the film industry of Hyderabad to the demolition of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City.We\u0027ll also be in Chengdu, Dar es Salaam, Nanjing, Ahmedabad, Surat, Baghdad, Kuala Lumpur, Xi\u0027an, Seoul, Wuhan and London.Read more from\u0026nbspthe next 15 megacities\u0026nbspseries here.This furtive car-cruising is just one of the signs of youthful rebellion against draconian moral codes, and an indication that the Iranian capital might be becoming gradually more relaxed. In Ab-o-Atash park, a teenage girl in skinny jeans and rollerblades allows her headscarf to drop briefly as she coasts past a group of gawping boys. Nearby, a tape of religious music is drowned out by the blaring hip-hop coming from the skatepark. Gaggles of families pose for selfies, while black-cloaked women shuffle past on their way to the mosque.“We never had spaces like this when we were growing up here,” says a middle-aged woman visiting from Canada with her sister, where they have both lived for the past 20 years after moving from Iran. “Even a few years ago, a scene like this would have been unthinkable.”These visions of tolerance and mutual co-existence are a far cry from most foreigners’ preconceived images of Tehran – a place where religious law still forbids women from riding bicycles. On the new Tabiat pedestrian bridge, whose futuristic tendrils wind their way across the valley, young couples sit arm-in-arm, while groups of girls saunter past, their headscarves pulled so far back they seem to defy gravity. “If we’d been seen out with a boy like this,” adds one of the sisters, “we would have been forced to marry them.”This scene of apparent social freedom turns out to be precariously balanced. In 2011, a couple of years after the park opened, 10 people were arrested by the morality police after holding a water fight in the fountains. Two years ago, an extra 7,000 morality police were introduced in Tehran, specifically to monitor the strict hijab rules, targeting everything from loose-fitting headscarves and shortened trousers for women, to glamorous hairstyles and necklaces for men. Given the capital’s population explosion the authorities face an uphill struggle. From the decks of Tabiat bridge, evening crowds – suspended above the bumper-to-bumper traffic of an eight-lane highway – admire the sunset through a thick haze of smog. Cranes stretch to the horizon, conjuring ever taller concrete towers which march incessantly into the surrounding hills.Tehran’s population now numbers around 8.4 million people in the city proper, swelling to 14 million in the wider metropolitan region, making it the most populous city in western Asia. It is set to join the global ranks of megacities by 2035, according to forecasts from the UN, with its residents passing the 10 million mark in 2028.But Tehran is a city on the brink. With some of the world’s highest levels of congestion, air pollution, water shortages, land subsidence and eye-watering costs of living, headscarves should be the least of the authorities’ worries.Stuck in traffic on one of Tehran’s interminable freeways, the city can feel like Los Angeles with minarets. The similarity is no coincidence: its modern urban structure was laid out by America’s own doyen of postwar sprawl, Victor Gruen. The godfather of the suburban shopping mall was hired by the Iranian government in 1966 to masterplan the future of the capital, and plotted a web of highways that would thread their way through the undulating topography, connecting a dispersed network of neighbourhoods separated by lush green valleys. The model was typical of American new towns – only adapted to the foothills of the Alborz mountains.It was part of a wave of projects resulting from the American government’s deep engagement with the ruling Pahlavi dynasty. Come the Islamic Revolution of 1979, the masterplan embodied everything that the new regime stood against: it was the detestable legacy of the Shah writ large across the city. Attempts to make a new plan were rejected by the city, so a decision was made to go on with the Gruen scheme, while gleefully rejecting many of its key principles.There has been a financial incentive behind the city’s expansion too. In the years following the revolution, the municipality realised that a handsome stream of income could be generated by allowing developers to breach the density limits set out in the masterplan in exchange for a substantial fee. Zoning laws were bent and construction permits issued. Revenues collected were then invested in major urban development projects, which in turn increased the value of real estate. The urban form of Tehran was built around a system of institutionalised bribery, which continues to this day.“Anyone can pay a fine and build a high-rise,” says Masoud Taghavi, former editor of Iranian architecture magazine Hamshahri Memari. “There are some plans, but in most cases they’re being ignored. You see highways where they shouldn’t be, buildings where they shouldn’t be, shopping malls where they shouldn’t be.”The practice of selling density has led to an identikit form of residential development, with plots simply filled to their limits and extruded to maximise the saleable floor area. Most are designed without terraces or balconies and with minimal open space around them.The policy has also seen a proliferation of huge commercial buildings with little regard to their wider impact. As chairman of Tehran city council’s health and environment committee, Mohammad Haqqani, put it: “Tehran municipality is granting permits to almost all applicants wishing to construct commercial buildings like shopping malls and office buildings, without paying attention to the real needs of each district and the worsening traffic congestion in the sprawling capital.” Following a spate of high-end malls, a district in northern Tehran finally banned their construction last year. But it is too little too late.Many point the finger at Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Iran’s former chief of police and several-time failed presidential candidate, who served as the mayor of Tehran from 2005 until 2017. He presided over a wealth of impressive-looking trophy projects which introduced a glossy image of modernity – but did little to tackle the city’s real problems.The expansion of the Sadr expressway was one of his most publicised achievements, seeing a three-mile long double-decker concrete highway erected in the north-east of the city. Articles on the project were greeted with comments such as “Long live Tehran’s master builder, the humble accomplisher, Dr Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf,” and “May the eyes of the envious and extremist burst in jealousy.”Those eyes are now watering at the vast expense and unintended consequences of the grand plan, which has had the effect of increasing traffic and further cementing car as king. Members of the Tehran city council conceded last year that adequate research was not conducted before construction began, and that the elevated highway has failed to achieve its main purpose. “It is a disastrous project,” says architect and urbanist Ahmadreza Hakiminejad. “It was hailed as a way of reducing Tehran’s congestion, but it has had the opposite result. If you make more room for cars, you get more cars on the street. More cars means more congestion and more pollution.”All schools in the capital were forced to close one day last year due to the dangerous levels of toxic particles in the air. Pollution causes an annual 20,000 deaths, according to deputy health minister Alireza Raeisi, a statistic that has even prompted the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to weigh in: it is now religiously forbidden to drive vehicles in such high levels of pollution without valid rationale. Ghalibaf put his efforts into applying a thin layer of decoration across Tehran in an attempt to ert people’s attention from its day-to-day dysfunction. The Bureau of Beautification was established to oversee a campaign of murals, bollard paintings and curious sculptures. A stretch of Valiasr Street now has a sculpture garden along one side, where a number of dead trees have been adorned with artwork to disguise the fact they’re stricken due to lack of water. Bus stops have been decorated and novelty benches commissioned – but nothing has changed beneath the surface.Hakiminejad says the beautification campaign and the Sadr expressway are just two of innumerable ill-conceived schemes conducted over the last decade, along with policies that have seen the trampling of the city’s little remaining green space. Over the past decade, around 4,000 hectares of Tehran’s former gardens have been destroyed by the so-called “garden tower” act, which allows people to build high-rises on garden land.Other grand visions, like the satellite development around the artificial Chitgar Lake to the north-west of Tehran, have similarly backfired. The lake has been accused of erting much-needed flows of water from the city, while the surrounding plots have been sold off in the usual fashion, spawning a grim forest of high-rise towers and malls. There are few of the facilities such as schools that a functioning new urban centre needs.“It’s yet another ‘wow’ project, designed more as a tourist attraction than an extension of the city,” says Hakiminejad. “It’s going to end up being a vertical slum.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6eccfd3814bbdcf44232b118257ecc876163e8/0_2880_3202_1920/master/3202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3da69955da61c200ae6b2c92196f9c25","title":"concrete city beauty los angeles in pictures","story":"LA is a city of concrete.

Maybe it can work the other way aroundImperial College London is including cookery lessons in its chemistry degree courses, starting this September. The Introduction to Culinary Practice module, created in collaboration with the chef Jozef Youssef from the Basque Culinary Centre, will allow students to “experience the ambiguities and challenges of translating written instructions into action” (AKA “following a recipe”). There are several reasons why I think this is a great idea, only some of which hold academic weight.I met Youssef several years ago, and he is one of the most absurdly good-looking men I have ever set eyes upon. He looks like a young Antonio Banderas had sex with a Magimix in Zorro’s kitchen. His science-theory-inflected food is extraordinary, too. At the tasting menu I attended, we ate origami pasta, oyster ice-cream and fossilised squash. One course was based on a Mexican folk tale and there was a mushroom dish based around the scent of petrichor. I was like a kid in a candy store. Not a real candy store, obviously, a virtual one, with piped custard aromas and implanted happy memories. Molecular gastronomy gets a bad rap from traditional food critics, seen as “all fur coat, no knickers”, but it’s right up my street. Spherification, emulsions, foams, there’s a Roald Dahl-esque theatre to this type of food that I love.Another good sign is that the professor of surgical education and engagement science who spearheaded the changes is called Roger Kneebone. I hope that’s not one of the techniques he has pioneered. Is there anyone who doesn’t feel their purpose on Earth bolstered by such a delightful piece of nominative determinism? I wonder if the years of hearing bad jokes have broken him. Anyway, his involvement guarantees the course’s success. It’s meant to be.Is cooking really educational? It’s not a trivial question. According to Kneebone, the thigh bone’s connected – no, hold on. According to Kneebone, many surgical students spend so much time on screens that they have lost the dexterity to stitch patients. OkayOK, he does sound a little bit broken. The idea behind this course is that the practical skills required by cooking will be invaluable to a new generation of scientists. And I believe that’s true. Just look at The Great British Bake Off: some of its best contestants, such as Rahul Mandal and Andrew Smyth, make brownies with a set square.Cooking is one of the best teachers I’ve known. Not only has it kept me sane and healthy, it has also got me more interested in the science of food and its preparation, despite being a chemistry brain-dud who thought an ionic bond was a Greek spy. Through cooking, I became interested in Maillard reactions and nasal receptors, fermentation, the hydrophilic-hydrophobic magic of egg yolks, denaturing proteins and the vibrational spectra of courgettes. There’s no reason this wouldn’t work the other way around – that booksmart students can’t develop their powers of observation, adaptation and hands-on ability by making chips or turning out a spotted dick.The university has indicated that, as part of the module, the students will have access to research instruments such as centrifuges, rotary evaporators and sonic homogenisers just picturing these God-level gadgets has me breaking out in excitement hives. It’s great these chemistry undergraduates will be bettering our understanding of the world and if that dream collapses like a soufflé, they will still have some great transferable skills. They could open an organic vegetarian restaurant, called Stems. No? Jeez, you get more of a reaction from helium. Thank you, I’m here all week.

The darker politics that was mixed in with the mainstream leave vote no longer feels the need to hide. On Monday, Anna Soubry, Owen Jones and I were confronted by it. But those who verbally attacked and physically harassed us do not speak for ordinary leave voters or the disadvantaged. They have nothing to do with the pro-Brexit protesters, with whom I respectfully disagree.I’ve encountered them before talking to people around the country is what I do. I’ve engaged with them at People’s Vote marches in Sunderland and outside parliament. I even attended a rally led by the English Defence League’s so-called Tommy Robinson. A figure close to Robinson admitted to me (believing I was pro Brexit) that they knew Brexit would make the country poorer. Knowingly going ahead with a policy that leaves desperately squeezed people even worse off is a betrayal of those they claim to represent.These far-right groups go to the most neglected parts of the country, like Sunderland, and prey on existing frustrations with a London-centric political system that has left them behind. And instead of pushing to address regional inequality and the democratic powerlessness created by our constituency-based voting system, they point the finger at minorities and the EU. And now that leaving the EU hasn’t worked out, they seek to silence any national dialogue about what to do about it.I’m not afraid of these sad few men in their hi-vis jackets, ironically copying a movement that started in France. But I am afraid they will define what constitutes acceptable debate around Brexit. It would be a disaster if we let the shape of UK democracy and dialogue be fixed by the demands of thugs.The abuse and threatening behaviour of these iniduals around parliament is unacceptable. And it isn’t just heckling. In this instance, a group of men surrounded an MP. Some iniduals in that group aggressively shouted abuse in her face, then appeared to physically block her from entering parliament (her place of work).Plenty of people around the country are frustrated with the Brexit process – and all but a tiny minority continue to engage in reasonable democratic debate. This debate is absolutely crucial given the vastly different and country-defining options the UK faces. We must be able to have it without feeling like some options are unacceptable because a tiny minority of people are willing to go further, and shout louder, than everyone else. The answer to the far right cannot be to give in. We have never, and will never, let them dictate the terms of debate. When they argue for less democracy, we must call for more.I disagree vehemently with Jacob Rees-Mogg. But when far-left activists went to his house and verbally attacked him in front of his children, that was wrong. When Julia Hartley-Brewer, with whom I regularly argue on the radio, receives abuse on Twitter, I defend her. Because there’s a key difference between intense political discourse and gratuitous abuse, no matter where you are on the spectrum.That’s why I’m constantly calling out those on my side who label all Brexit voters uneducated, as if remainers are all experts in EU law. I also criticise those who label all Brexit voters racist, as if one needs to be racist to follow the advice of senior politicians that Brexit would help the NHS. These blanket accusations aren’t just factually wrong, they mean that when we encounter real racism, we won’t be taken seriously – when a prominent figure within the group shouted “You ain’t even **** British” at a BAME police officer, for example.The silver lining of this mess is that we can now identify those who sow ision and hatred, isolate them and make a real effort to listen to and address the concerns of ordinary Brexit voters.• Femi Oluwole is chief spokesperson for Our Future, Our Choice"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bdd94c7f32e29940858ec56ca2ea9b87b58f361/0_79_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af89b2280dfeac9295296802d6c3392b","title":"toxic fumes children health air pollution emissions","story":"Imagine that you could buy, in thousands of shops across the country, canisters containing toxic gas. Imagine that some people walked the streets, squirting this gas into the face of every child they passed. Imagine that it became a craze, so that a child couldn’t walk a metre without receiving a faceful. Imagine that, while a single dose was unlikely to cause serious harm, repeated doses damaged their hearts, lungs and brains, affecting their health, their intelligence and their life chances.It would be treated as a national emergency. Sales of the canisters would immediately be banned. The police would be mobilised. If existing laws against poisoning children were deemed insufficient, new legislation would be rushed through parliament. It’s not hard to picture this response, is it? Yet the mass poisoning is happening. And nothing changes.According to a paper in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, burning fossil fuels is now “the world’s most significant threat to children’s health”. Their life chances are compromised before they are born. Toxic particles from exhaust fumes pass through the lungs of pregnant women and accumulate in the placenta. The risk of premature birth and low birthrate this causes is described in the British Medical Journal as “something approaching a public health catastrophe”.Among the likely impacts of repeated poisoning, researchers now believe, is a “huge reduction” in intelligence. A paper published last year found that “long-term exposure to air pollution impedes cognitive performance in verbal and math tests”. Pollution stunts the growth of lungs as well as minds, raising the risk of asthma, cancer, stroke and heart failure.How will this affect the Diesel Generation: in other words, those born since 2001? This was the year in which Tony Blair’s government, rather than delivering the integrated public transport it had long promised, sought to tweak the carbon emissions from cars by taxing diesel engines at a lower rate than petrol engines. Diesel cars might produce a little less carbon dioxide, but they release more nitrogen oxides and particulates, a tendency exacerbated by the manufacturers’ cheating. An entire generation – 18 years of births – has been exposed to the results of this folly.Given that researchers have found an association between air pollution and childhood mental illness, could this help explain the rising prevalence of psychiatric disorders among English children since the first major survey, in 1999? A study conducted in London suggests that people with the highest exposure to pollution also have a greater risk of developing dementia. Might we have triggered a dementia timebomb, that could explode in 40 or 50 years?The only difference between the absurd scenario with which this article began and reality is intent: no one means to poison children with their exhaust fumes. But the absence of a mens rea makes no difference to their health. The one-tonne metal canisters are still on sale (though the number bought has dipped slightly in the past year) and toxic gas is pumped into our children’s faces with every step they take. Especially on the way to and from school. These are the times at which children inhale the most particulates (especially if they are driven – exposure is much greater inside a car than on the pavement). Horrifying recent data also reveals that pollutants from nearby roads accumulate in classrooms, leading to higher levels inside than out. Due to the continued failure of successive governments to address this crisis, taking children to school damages their minds.When the government won’t act, only palliatives remain. In desperation, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has started installing air filters in nurseries and classrooms. It’s as if, rather than vaccinating children against diphtheria, they were issued with face masks.After the Lancet commission on pollution and health reported, in 2017, that pollution kills more people than tobacco – and three times as many as Aids, tuberculosis and malaria combined – you might have hoped that governments, development agencies and health charities would have made it a priority. But they remain focused on communicable disease, while ignoring the greater, manmade threat. Where is Save the Children? Where is Médecins Sans Frontières? Where are the philanthropists seeking to eliminate deaths from ambient air pollution, as Bill and Melinda Gates and others seek to wipe out malaria?I think there may be three reasons. The first is that there is no heroic narrative built around tackling air pollution, while there are plenty (Louis Pasteur, Alexander Fleming, John Snow) surrounding the fight against infection. The second is that the necessary interventions are not discrete but systemic. Rather than distributing mosquito nets or reducing the salt in processed food, you must change entire transport and industrial systems. The third is that, while no one has a commercial interest in spreading tuberculosis or polio, there is a massive global lobby, comprised of fossil fuel, motor and infrastructure companies, blocking effective action against pollution and the technologies that cause it. If you take on pollution, you take on the combined might of some of the world’s most powerful industries. Pollution is the tangible manifestation of corruption.The solution is political: confronting the power of this lobby and overturning the governments it has captured, then replacing private cars and ever-expanding roads with electric mass transit, walking and cycling, and imposing stringent conditions on dirty industries. We have been abandoned by those who claim to defend our children from disease. So we must mobilise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0af31d9c3a841a7e3c8acbedd71d8711ea14cf0c/27_42_1967_1180/master/1967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d606605a32b0d0b57aecb177167fdabe","title":"suspended swansea university vice chancellor richard davies launches formal complaint","story":"Richard Davies claims he is victim of ‘negligently flawed investigation’ by universityThe vice-chancellor of Swansea University, who was suspended  in November pending an internal investigation, has launched a formal complaint that he was the victim of a “negligently flawed investigation”.Prof Richard Davies, in a 10-page grievance letter, said he “profoundly” denied the allegations against him and intended to fight to clear his name. He also described the devastating impact his suspension and the way it was conducted had on his mental health and wellbeing, and that of his family.Davies led the university for 15 years during a time of huge expansion, when student numbers doubled and the institution moved up the league tables. He was one of four members of staff to be suspended, including the dean of the school of management, Prof Marc Clement, who has also denied any wrongdoing and lodged a formal grievance.In his letter, the vice-chancellor called for his suspension to be withdrawn and the disciplinary process to be postponed pending the outcome of his grievance. He said he had been “treated appallingly”, and claimed he was facing “unfounded and disingenuous allegations” and had been suspended “illegitimately and dishonestly”, causing irreversible damage to his reputation and health.A spokesperson for the university, responding to Davies’s allegations, insisted the correct procedures had been followed throughout the investigation and said appropriate support had been offered to him.According to the letter, Davies said he was given no warning he was to be suspended. He claimed he was escorted off the university campus by the head of security and left “entirely socially isolated” after being banned from contacting colleagues.Davies said the conditions of his suspension meant he was also banned from unaccompanied access to the university-owned house that had been his family home for the past 15 years, a move he described as “punitive” and “malicious”.“Beyond the massive inconvenience of not having access to my clothes, personal items and mail, being excluded from my own home at the incredibly difficult time immediately after my suspension had a huge effect on my mental health and wellbeing,” the letter said.The personal consequences were however “dwarfed” by the potential damage to the institution, he said. “I am being mentally tormented by the almost daily news in the media evidencing the damage this is all doing to the reputation of the university I love, with serious implications for its future financial health,” the letter said.The university has not confirmed the reasons for the suspensions, but Davies’ letter detailed an allegation of gross misconduct and an accusation of “having failed to assure appropriate due diligence, governance and systems of control around major projects and the commercial activities of the university”.It is virtually unprecedented for a vice-chancellor to be suspended in the UK higher education sector, where senior management figures usually quietly retire.The allegations at Swansea were understood to focus on the university’s involvement in the development of a “wellness and life science village” in the Delta Lakes area of Llanelli. The project, which has been led by Carmarthenshire county council, was put on hold pending the outcome of the inquiry at Swansea University.A university spokesperson said: “The suspensions were made following a thorough and wide-reaching internal investigation.“This is still ongoing, so it would not be appropriate to comment in detail at this time, but the university has at all times acted fully in accordance with its own ordinances, and offered appropriate support to Prof Davies.”Asked about the vice-chancellor’s claims of being banned from his family home, the university said Davies had indicated that he and his family had moved out of the property in the summer of 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73bdd890897c2d101fb7e695c4bc4416a7aaf685/0_250_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8c4745cac3ac542d9d2a088c6791f06","title":"oxford students call for professors removal over alleged homophobia","story":"Hundreds of students sign petition to remove emeritus professor John Finnis from teachingStudents at Oxford University are demanding that a Catholic law professor be sacked for alleged homophobia.At least 350 students have signed a petition calling for John Finnis to be removed from teaching, citing a “a long record of extremely discriminatory views against many groups of disadvantaged people” including the LGBT+ community.Finnis, 78, who is emeritus professor of law and legal philosophy at University College, has rejected the students’ claims, saying there was “not a ‘phobic’ sentence” in all his writings.His Collected Essays, published in 2011, include an assertion from a paper published in 1994 that homosexuality is “never a valid, humanly acceptable choice and form of life”. It is “destructive of human character and relationships”, he wrote, because “it treats human sexual capacities in a way which is deeply hostile to the self-understanding of those members who are willing to commit themselves to real marriage”.Migration is another theme in his writing. In a paper published a decade ago, he wrote: “European states in the early 21st century move … into a trajectory of demographic and cultural decay … population transfer and replacement by a kind of reverse colonisation.” He warned of coming “ethnic and religious inter-communal miseries of hatred, bloodshed and political paralysis”.Finnis, who converted to Catholicism in 1962, has advised the Vatican and mentored the conservative US judge, Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed to the US supreme court by Donald Trump in 2017.The students’ petition calls for Finnis to be removed from teaching on the grounds that “university is a place to focus on education, not to be forced to campaign against or to be taught by professors who have promoted hatred towards students that they teach”.The students also want Oxford “to clarify its official position on professors who have expressed discriminatory views and behaved in discriminatory ways, especially those who have shown obvious hatred and intolerance”.Finnis told the Oxford Student: “I stand by all these writings. There is not a ‘phobic’ sentence in them. The 1994 essay promotes a classical and strictly philosophical moral critique of all non-marital sex acts and has been republished many times, most recently by Oxford University Press in the third volume of my Collected Essays.”Alex Benn, one of the authors of the petition, said Finnis had “built a career on demonisation. His so-called arguments about disadvantaged people are hateful, not to mention widely discredited”.Benn told the Oxford Student: “Campaigns like this one often receive simplistic responses calling for tolerance or academic freedom. But law, employment and education already draw boundaries about what won’t be tolerated. The humanity of disadvantaged people, including LGBTQ+ people, isn’t a debate … I started this campaign not only to address the specific issue of Finnis’ role at Oxford, but to get Oxford to make up its mind – either it’s in support of equality or it’s not.”A university spokesperson said: “Oxford University and the Faculty of Law promote an inclusive culture, which respects the rights and dignity of all staff and students. We are clear we do not tolerate any form of harassment of iniduals on any grounds, including sexual orientation.“Equally, the university’s harassment policy also protects academic freedom of speech and is clear that vigorous academic debate does not amount to harassment when conducted respectfully and without violating the dignity of others. All of the university’s teaching activity, including that in the Faculty of Law, is conducted according to these principles.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e69df341f91916210870370f28515904694e4be/0_327_4909_2946/master/4909.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f32f70f7322352effab44ea1e99bc2d","title":"joshua tree park closed shutdown vandalism latest","story":"Maintenance and sanitation problems also reported 18 days after government shutdown furloughed the vast majority of park staffFor 17 days, a host of volunteers and a skeleton staff kept the trash cans and toilets from overflowing at Joshua Tree national park.But on Tuesday, 18 days after the federal government shutdown furloughed the vast majority of national park staff, officials announced that vandalism of the park’s distinctive namesake plants and other maintenance and sanitation problems will require closure starting Thursday.“While the vast majority of those who visit Joshua Tree do so in a responsible manner, there have been incidents of new roads being created by motorists and the destruction of Joshua trees in recent days that have precipitated the closure,” spokesman George Land said in a news release.Land told the Los Angeles Times that, with only eight rangers currently overseeing the nearly 800,000 acre park, the gates would likely remain closed until the shutdown ends.But a different spokesman for the National Parks Service, Mike Litterst, subsequently told the Times that the park may not close after all if staff are able to complete cleanup work before Thursday.National Park Service officials did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.The potential closure of Joshua Tree was met with mixed emotions by those whose livelihoods depend on the more than 2.8 million visitors the park attracts annually.“I have 11 employees who are effectively going to be laid off as of Thursday,” said Seth Zaharias, co-owner of a company that leads rock climbing trips in the park. “They are not going to work for the remainder of the shutdown.”Still, Zaharias said that reports of vandalism to the park made him support the closure. “Economically, that’s disastrous for our community,” he said of the prospect of serious environmental damage to the park. “It’s really bad.”His company was beginning to send out cancellation notices for customers who had booked trips after Thursday, he said.David Lamfrom, director of the California desert and national wildlife programs for the National Parks Conservation Association, warned that the damage to Joshua Tree’s desert landscape could be catastrophic.“It’s an incredibly fragile landscape that takes generations and generations to grow, and generations and generations to heal,” Lamfrom said. “The amount of time it takes to heal can be on the geological scale.”Lamfrom expressed frustration that community members had been placed in the position of trying to keep the park operating during the shutdown.“For business owners and community members to have to take up the mantle and the burden of running our national parks makes no sense,” he said. “We have professionals who are dedicated to doing that work, and they’re sitting at home.”Lamfrom also warned that because most of the park’s rangers are furloughed, the extent of environmental damage is likely still unknown.“The main story has been about poop, but I think there’s a much bigger story,” he said. “The resource impacts could be really dangerous. We’re reeling, and we’re all just kind of hoping that the worst hasn’t happened.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d1d506cb813571aca7a2f193cb52d4df64a2a99/0_1_2497_1498/master/2497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c57808788f9c27f42b7d51618d8db37","title":"colette film author french keira knightley","story":"A new biopic of Colette starring Keira Knightley explores the enduring appeal of the French novelist, polymath and style legendOpen Colette’s Wikipedia entry and – just as with one of her novels – you’re hooked right away. “She was a French author and woman of letters, also known as a mime, actress and journalist, nominated for the Nobel prize in literature in 1948.” She wrote more than 30 novels and was called “the greatest living French writer of fiction” by the New York Times, just before her death in 1954.That’s not to mention her status as the ultimate cat lover. Thanks to Colette, feline fans on Instagram have an almost endless supply of quotes for captions (“Our perfect companions never have fewer than four feet” is a personal favourite). The other accolade missing from that impressive CV? Style icon.Colette, born in 1873, came of age as photography became popularised. When the cheap and easy-to-use Kodak Brownie became available in 1900, she was 27 and already a personality in Paris.She was photographed in thinker’s pose at her desk in a polka dot blouse lounging with two cats and matching feline eye makeup smoking in a man’s suit in black stockings and dancewear backstage before a performance … In almost every picture, her kohl-rimmed eyes meet the viewer’s (and the photographer’s, more than likely a man) with confidence. Colette offers a lesson in how a woman can use style to take ownership of her image – ensuring that she always has the last word.Colette famously drew on her colourful life for her novels, including her experience of being a dancer in music halls (The Vagabond) and having an affair with a much younger man (Chéri and The Last of Chéri) the breakthrough Claudine series was inspired by her school days. The expressive “this is me” shrug of her attitude is just as refreshing today as it was more than a century ago. It cuts through the decades much like her way of wearing men’s tailoring – in soft velvet with lashings of eye makeup and jaunty neckscarves. Colette, the new biopic in cinemas this week with Keira Knightley in the title role, focuses on the author’s formative years. Growing up in the Burgundy countryside, she met Henry Gauthier-Villars AKA Willy, a controversial author and socialite who was an acquaintance of her father’s. He was 14 years her senior they married in 1893. As the film tells it, Colette used fashion as a way to express her transformation from a country girl in frills and long plaits to Parisian It-girl with a bob and a trouser suit (sidenote: Knightley’s leg of mutton blouses and cropped boleros could also work in 2019).Andrea Flesch, the film’s costume designer, says Colette’s style reflected not only her journey, but also the shifts in society at the turn of the century.The author herself was no slouch when it came to branding, either. Born Sidonie-Gabrielle, she became known by only her surname while she was still at school, recognising way before Madonna that a single moniker announces your importance from the get-go. After she separated from Willy, who famously plagiarised his wife, in 1906, this approach helped her as she became a giant of French literature.Those taking style inspiration from novelists such as Colette reflect a wider, more highbrow trend in fashion: US novelist Joan Didion featured in a Celine campaign in 2015 French New Wave director Agnès Varda is the cover star of The Gentlewoman autumn edition, while painter Georgia O’Keefe’s personal style was featured in the New Yorker last year.Terry Newman, in the coffee table book Legendary Authors and the Clothes They Wore, describes how Colette used clothes to “radiate character, both in her own life and in the lives of the characters she created in her writing”. That influence has endured in some surprising ways, from retail to Hollywood: she lent her name to Colette, the cult Parisian boutique that became an industry favourite before closing after 20 years in 2017. And Colette discovered Givenchy muse Audrey Hepburn, casting the almost-unknown actor in the stage version of her novel Gigi in 1951.Always in the avant garde, Colette was also a pioneer in her acceptance of androgyny and sexuality that was, then, taboo: the film shows the author’s relationship with aristocrat Mathilde de Morny, or Missy, who was gay and wore men’s clothes.Flesch says Missy changed Colette’s style – a moment dramatised in the biopic when Knightley wears a pair of cycling culottes to stroll around a Parisian park. “Wearing trousers was a statement from Missy,” says Flesch. “She was scandalous, and she was accepted because she was a noblewoman and rich. Colette wanted to show she was on the same level. She wanted to shock as well.”Style isn’t a footnote of Colette’s legacy, it’s a central part of it. Sixty-five years after her death, her influence extends beyond your bookshelf, Instagram captions and cinema: Colette’s free spirit is inspiring our wardrobes, too.Colette is released in the UK this week "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17a3799341e5ff10a21a5abda943c2e4851e1187/0_360_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7878c7452aeaa4f35505b8e4da726559","title":"lfwm art school afterparty london fashion week men in pictures","story":"Tom Barratt and Eden Loweth’s first stand-alone Art School catwalk show opened London fashion week men’s at the weekend, celebrating the non-binary form with models cast to ‘push forward notions of otherness’.

Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, meanwhile, won best drama and best actor in a drama for Rami Malik.That film also performed strongly with British voters (though it was significantly omitted from the best film shortlist), taking it to level pegging – on seven nominations – with arch musical rival A Star is Born. Also on seven are First Man, the Neil Armstrong biopic starring Ryan Gosling, which has so far met with little awards love, and with Alfonso Cuarón’s much-lauded Roma.Meanwhile Vice, the Dick Cheney biopic which bagged Christian Bale the best actor in a comedy or musical prize on Sunday, came away with six nominations. Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman has five, and Green Book and Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War have four each.This year\u0027s Baftas take place on 10 February 2019. The ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall will be hosted by Joanna Lumley and broadcast – about 90 minutes after it actually happens – on BBC ONE.The Baftas are voted for by around 6,500 members of the British Film and Television Academy. These are industry workers who have to apply for membership – and pay an annual subscription of £450. Each category in the shortlists is decided by a chapter of around 100 specialists in that area. Once the shortlists are announced, all voters can have their say. If they haven\u0027t seen a particular film, they are supposed to abstain from voting in that category – but this is unenforced.\u0026nbspThe Baftas matter on their own terms, third only to the Golden Globes and the Oscars as prestige gongs. A Bafta win adds critical kudos – and, hopefully, box office – to a film, as well as credibility to an inidual\u0027s career. They also matter because of their proximity to the Oscars. Until 2001, the Baftas took place in April or May, but since the move to about a fortnight before the Academy Awards, their importance increased. This is because voting for the Oscars closes a few days after the Baftas, meaning it\u0027s the final chance for candidates to impress with their speeches - or for Oscar voters to seek to redress apparent miscarriages of justice. The Bafta and Oscar voting bases overlap considerably, too: around 500 people are thought to vote for both.\u0026nbspNot necessarily. A recent survey found the Baftas were only the fourth best Oscars bellwether – after the DGA, PGA and SAG awards. Since 2001, they\u0027ve predicted the best picture winner eight times out of a possible 17, erging the past four years running, opting for Three Billboards over The Shape of Water, La La Land over Moonlight, The Revenant\u0026nbspover Spotlight and\u0026nbspBoyhood\u0026nbspover Birdman. Their form is stronger when it comes to the acting categories, though they do consistently favour homegrown talent.\u0026nbspA big bronze mask on a marble base, which Bafta reserves the right to buy back for £1 should the recipient give it to anyone other than their children. Plus a certificate, with which the winner can do what they like.Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Mary Poppins Returns, Mary, Queen of Scots and Stan \u0026amp Ollie have three nominations each. Steve Coogan was nominated over co-star John C Reilly in the latter, perhaps betraying voters’ British bias, although Emily Blunt was passed over for her part as the magical nanny, with Mary Poppins Returns up only for technical awards.Significant snubs included Steve McQueen, whose followup to 12 Years a Slave, Widows, scored just one nomination, for leading actress Viola Davis. If Beale Street Could Talk’s Regina King was also omitted, despite being favourite for the best supporting actress Oscar.Mike Leigh’s Peterloo also failed to pick up a single nomination, while Black Panther took just one (for visual effects). Peterloo marks a rare failure for Film4, which picked up 20 nominations on Wednesday across a slate which includes The Favourite, Cold War and Widows. Meanwhile BBC Films came away with four for its titles, Stan \u0026amp Ollie and Apostasy.The Bafta shortlists were read out by actors Will Poulter and Hayley Squires. This is the first year the BFI’s ersity standards have become mandatory in the best debut and best British film categories.These require films to fulfil a number of different production-stage quotas that demonstrate that they have “worked to increase the representation of under-represented groups” in areas including “onscreen representation” and “industry access and opportunities”. They come as part of Bafta’s drive to up the ersity of its membership, as well as the breadth of films they choose to celebrate.This year’s best British film nominees are Bohemian Rhapsody, The Favourite, Stan \u0026amp Ollie, fashion documentary McQueen, Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, starring a vengeful Joaquin Phoenix, and serial killer thriller Beast. The latter is also up for best British debut for its writerdirector Michael Pearce. Pitted alongside him are Daniel Kokotajlo for Apostasy, set amongst suburban Jehovah’s Witnesses Chris Kelly for activist documentary A Cambodian Spring, and the teams behind Pili, about HIV sufferers in Tanzania, and neo kitchen sink drama Ray \u0026amp Liz.The nominees for the Rising Star award – which is voted for by the public – were revealed last week, with Black Panther’s Letitia Wright fancied as early frontrunner.The Baftas will be announced in a ceremony on 10 February hosted for the second time by Joanna Lumley.

With that in mind, here’s a last-ditch appeal to the Academy on behalf of 11 performers who’ve been flouted by the awards-season-industrial complex – some on account of admittedly stiff competition, others because they appear in smaller, less Oscar-baity films that staged less robust PR campaigns, and a few, sadly, because the movies in which they appear aren’t in English.Yes, the race for best actress is as stacked with terrific performances as it’s been in years, but the exclusion of Carey Mulligan from the conversation is as strange and egregious an oversight as they come. In Wildlife, the directorial debut from Paul Dano, Mulligan plays Jeanette, a 1960s housewife left to her own devices after her unemployed husband abandons her and her son to fight wildfires in the forests of Montana. In a narrative presented mostly from the perspective of Jeanette’s teenage son, Joe, Mulligan gives the best acting performance of the year, male or female: she’s fickle, fierce, combustible, and impish, her tone of voice often oscillating from cheerful to coarse in accordance with the character’s mood. In a story that’s more or less about a kid coming to recognize and reckon with his parent’s flaws, Mulligan plays Jeanette with a thrilling unpredictability that calls to mind Gena Rowland in A Woman Under the Influence – and forces us, as viewers, to recount the moment we realized our parents were human, too.In a film with a cast as numerous and decorated as Widows’ ensemble – Viola Davis, Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall, Carrie Coon, Bryan Tyree Henry, Michelle Rodriguez, Cynthia Erivo, and Jacki Weaver are all here – it takes a real howitzer of a performance to stand out from the bunch. But in Steve McQueen’s follow-up to 12 Years a Slave, Daniel Kaluuya and Elizabeth Debicki do just that, occupying opposite ends of the film’s vast and frequently fluctuating moral continuum. As Jatemme Manning, the mob enforcer to his brother Jamal’s political campaign, Kaluuya oozes menace: to look into his eyes as he stares down a lackey spitting a few rap bars is to vow never to freestyle again. Debicki, meanwhile, is the film’s heart, a damaged woman in thrall to her abusive mother and husband who joins the Viola Davis-led heist and convinces you her life depends it. Both performances, though overlooked by most awards bodies (save a few critics’ groups), are emotionally rich but tactful, too, governed less by histrionics than meaningful glances and grimaces.The star of the year’s best film, Roma’s Yalitza Aparicio, still has an outside shot at nabbing a best actress nomination. But in a crowded year for supporting actress, headlined by Regina King, Amy Adams, and the women of The Favourite, Aparicio’s co-star Marina de Tavira has fallen through the cracks. That’s a shame, since what she does with her role as the matriarch of a household in turmoil is pretty breathtaking. Her character Sofia swings like a pendulum she lets out strident commands (“¿Adónde vas?,” she screams at her disobedient son) provides comic relief (watch her attempt to wriggle her Ford Galaxy between two trucks on a Mexico City freeway) and allows her character’s compassion and dejection to surface in gestures both big and small, a vast arsenal of actorly gifts at her disposal. “No matter what they tell you, as women, we are always alone,” she says to Cleo in a moment of desolation that’s brilliantly, perhaps surprisingly, punctuated by a burst of drunken physical comedy. In the humble opinion of this writer, it was the year’s second-best performance (a smidgen behind Mulligan).The year’s best, most cryptic villain – a personification of the “you v the guy she told you not to worry about” meme – was Steven Yeun’s Ben in Burning, the director Lee Chang-dong’s hypnotizing adaptation of Haruki Murakami’s short story. Think Jay Gatsby meets Patrick Bateman meets Dickie Greenleaf: Yeun plays this smooth-talking cosmopolite with a pathological charm that never quite reveals itself in full, which is precisely what makes the characterization so uniquely chilling and seductive. It’s a testament to Yeun’s commitment that Ben’s veneer of disquieting swagger never breaks: he yawns, laughs, speaks, smokes, shakes hands, and discloses his casual pyromania all with the same air of arrogant self-possession. Critics’ groups out of Chicago, Los Angeles, and Toronto recognized Yeun as the year’s best supporting actor, so perhaps it isn’t asking too much that the Academy take note too.This 20-year-old actor’s debut in Josephine Decker’s brilliant Madeline’s Madeline is on par with Natalie Portman in Black Swan and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Synecdoche, New York, in the pantheon of art-and-life-blurring roles. A gifted actress in a New York City-based experimental theatre troupe, and a mercurial teenager on the verge of a psychotic break, Howard’s Madeline is that rare characterization of an adolescent that’s refreshingly unmoored from convention. Immersed in her subjectivity, we experience Madeline’s sense of disorientation in the world and then watch her bring pain and suffering into uncomfortably sharp focus, particularly in a dramatic monologue in which she’s asked to portray her own mother. In a year of outstanding film debuts from young female actors (Aparicio in Roma, Elsie Fisher in Eight Grade, Kiki Layne in If Beale Street Could Talk), Howard’s was particularly noteworthy.In the wake of the Golden Globes, Christian Bale may very well ride his win to a best actor Oscar, with Bradley Cooper and Viggo Mortensen trailing close behind. Each represents a different version of the kind of muscular, immersive leading performance the Academy likes to honor. What Lakeith Stanfield does in Boots Riley’s Sorry to Bother You, however, is considerably different. As Cassius “Cash” Green, an upwardly mobile telemarketer, Stanfield is often comically incredulous. Despite his ascent in the world of tech, things happen to Cash more often than he makes them happen, and Stanfield plays it with a certain affable bemusement. It’s one of those performances that works in service of a film-maker’s vision, in this case Riley’s wild satire of a late-capitalist wasteland and its machine full of cogs.Rare is a protagonist, especially a female, middle-aged protagonist, as multitudinous as Isabelle of Claire Denis’ radiant romcom Let the Sunshine In, the lifeblood of which is Juliette Binoche’s effusive, heartfelt, and guileless lead performance as a woman looking for love. Isabelle, and as far as we can tell, Binoche too, feels everything to the fullest extent, and throughout the film, a dialogue-heavy procession of encounters with different men, her face is a transient canvas of emotions experienced not one-by-one but all at once. Watch her, for instance, in the film’s final scene, a long discussion with a clairvoyant who predicts the future of Isabelle’s various dalliances. His every ination is met with its own reaction: Isabelle’s neck tenses up, or she laughs incredulously, or her smile broadens, or her lips purse. It’s a nakedly human and life-affirming performance from one of our greatest actors.The slow burn and eventual emotional gut punch of Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters is reflected most clearly in the supporting performance of Sakura Andô, who plays her character, Nobuyo, with a delicate touch not dissimilar to the film’s direction. She is sincere but necessarily stealthy, loving and devious, easily one of the most sympathetic and likable characters on film this year, which is odd if you come across a bare-boned synopsis of the movie: a family of savvy shoplifters kidnaps a young girl. In a scene where Nobuyo is interrogated by Japanese police, her eyes evince profound sadness and principled determination, like vectors for Kore-eda and the film’s touching exploration of a family linked by trust instead of blood.If it were up to me, Joaquin Phoenix would have two Oscars to his name and a third – for his performance as Joe in Lynne Ramsey’s You Were Never Really Here – on the way. Alas, Phoenix’s harsh, uncompromising turn as a hired gun who rescues sex-trafficked young girls has been mostly ignored by major awards bodies and critics’ groups, even though he took home the best actor prize at the Cannes film festival, where the film premiered in 2017. Here, Phoenix and his body appear more lived-in than ever, the lines that branch across his face suggesting toil and trauma. With more action than talk, Phoenix and Ramsey invite us into the character’s wounded headspace, effectively evoking the sense of rage and violent resolve that compels him to do what he does.As if the best actress conversation weren’t crowded enough, here’s another tour de force to consider. As a kindergarten teacher and failed poet in Sara Colangelo’s remake of the 2015 Israeli film of the same name, Maggie Gyllenhaal gives the year’s most anxiety-inducing performance, embodying obsessive compulsion and intellectual unease. Her character Lisa takes what seems like an innocent, maternal interest in the poetic ingenuity of one of her students, seeing it as her responsibility to cultivate his talent before it’s soiled, presumably like her own, by an increasingly vainglorious world. What ensues is a crescendo of discomfiting events that are both more and less ethically ambiguous than they feel, anchored by Gyllenhaal’s tremendous ability to be entirely consumed by her character’s one-track mind and strange sense of duty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f3aea20b503114ec532fb4e8d5c811393128a5d/0_123_3685_2211/master/3685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd1a176a28a4eb739e45bc5468df33c","title":"benjamin pavard bayern munich join summer","story":"Bayern Munich have reached an agreement to sign the France defender Benjamin Pavard, who will join the German champions on a five-year deal from next season, according to the Bavarian club’s sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic.The 22-year-old currently plays for their Bundesliga rivals VfB Stuttgart and was involved in France’s 2018 World Cup final victory over Croatia in Russia, a tournament where he also scored a stunning goal in the last-16 win over Argentina. The fee is believed to be €35m (£31.4m).“I can announce that we managed to get the services of Benjamin Pavard from 1 July 2019,” Salihamidzic said during a Bayern training camp in Qatar. “He signed a five-year contract.”Salihamidzic also confirmed Bayern’s interest in Chelsea teenage forward Callum Hudson-Odoi, as they look to boost their frontline following the expected departure of veteran wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery at the end of the season.“He is a very interesting player whom we really want to sign,” Salihamidzic added of the 18-year-old. “He has qualities that fit into our game.

The 45-year-old will take over from Gary Rowett, who was sacked on Tuesday after less than eight months in charge.The decision to turn to Jones represents a significant shift in Stoke’s approach to managerial appointments, given the value that they have previously placed on experience. That strategy has not worked, however, and has resulted in Mark Hughes, Paul Lambert and Rowett leaving their positions in the space of little more than a year.Jones is not a high-profile name but he has a burgeoning reputation in the game after impressively turning around Luton’s fortunes following his appointment in January 2016. The Welshman led Luton to promotion from League Two last season, after missing out in the play-offs the year before, and they are currently second in League One.He will inherit a Stoke team that are languishing in 14th place in the Championship, which is well below the expectations of the club’s board, who had targeted an immediate return to the Premier League after suffering relegation last season. With Stoke only eight points outside the play-offs, that objective could still be achieved if Jones can make an immediate impact, starting with Saturday’s trip to Brentford.“Stoke City can confirm that the club is in discussions with Nathan Jones over the vacant managerial position,” the Championship club said on Twitter.A Luton statement on Twitter said: “We can confirm that we have granted permission to Stoke City to speak to Nathan Jones over their managerial vacancy.

That would also be staged at Wembley.The club’s subsequent home game would be the derby against Arsenal on 2 March and there is no chance of them being allowed to open the stadium that day. They want the grand opening to go smoothly and the politan police and security personnel have made it clear that what is the most troublesome fixture of the season would be too great a risk.All of which leaves the home league game against Palace on 16 March as the best-case scenario, although that would clash with a possible FA Cup quarter-final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/011280ba787c724c52a9e66be735b119931275d6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a182d9c792a3542c4e20666473317ad2","title":"ten football league teenagers watch 2019","story":"After several game-changing cameos off the bench, the York-born forward was finally handed his full debut by Marcelo Bielsa last Sunday. Raw and direct, Clarke has the ability to grab games by the scruff of the neck he kickstarted an extraordinary comeback victory at Villa Park last month and made a similar dent against Nottingham Forest and, before that, Sheffield United. Clarke has pleasantly surprised Bielsa, becoming the Argentinian’s go-to man, asked to spark Leeds into life at half-time on no fewer than six occasions since November. “When I started to look at his skills I didn’t imagine that he could make the difference as he is,” Bielsa said.After unsuccessful spells at Tottenham and QPR, the former Luton schoolboy arrived at Norwich on the same basis as a 16-year-old. Earmarked by academy staff as a future first-team right-back even before earning a contract, he was championed by the then youth coach Matt Gill after shining on tour in Latvia. Aarons, a cousin of the Newcastle winger Rolando, has not looked back since, establishing himself as a fixture in Daniel Farke’s high-flying side and winning four caps for England Under-19s since breaking into the team at the start of the season.It speaks volumes that Manchester United are among the clubs watching Semenyo, who joined Newport on a season’s loan in the summer. His performance helped the Exiles dump Leicester out of the FA Cup and led to Danny Simpson being hooked on the hour. Originally from south London, the powerful forward joined Bristol City almost 18 months ago after being spotted playing for South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, where the Championship club’s academy is based. Semenyo impressed on loan at Bath City last season and made his Bristol City debut in May. Saikou Janneh, the 18-year-old scoring for fun on loan at Torquay under Gary Johnson, the father of City’s manager, Lee, is another exciting forward.The youngster is the latest academy graduate to excel in the first team, following in the footsteps of James Maddison and Callum Wilson. Bayliss will likely make his 50th league appearance on Saturday and the ball-playing central midfielder has been at the heart of the Sky Blues’ rise since his full debut a little over a year ago. Tall and slight, Bayliss signed as an under-11 following an open trial but has had to overcome a couple of setbacks, including a hairline back fracture in his mid-teens, and the very late developer was made to wait before being offered a scholarship. “James always lit up training and the games, but Tom’s journey was a lot more steady than that – in a good way,” said academy manager Richard Stevens.“Remember the name,” said the Forest academy manager, Gary Brazil, last summer. There is a reason why Forest are keen to tie the winger, who has just turned 18 and made his league debut on New Year’s Day, to a new long-term contract. Appiah, another graduate from the revered academy, spent pre-season with the first team and has been tracked by top-flight clubs since shining for the under-23s as a 15-year-old. Born in the Netherlands to Ghanaian parents, Appiah has played for England through the age groups and was part of the under-17s squad that reached the semi-finals of the European Championships in May. A full-back’s worst nightmare, Appiah ghosts past players. “I think 2019 will be a good year for him,” Aitor Karanka said.The right-back has seized the chance afforded to him by Frank Lampard with both hands. Bogle caught the Derby manager’s eye in pre-season, was promoted to the first team and has kept Andre Wisdom out of the side ever since. Bogle progressed through the under-18s and under-23s last season before making his mark in the Championship and signed a new contract in September. The Reading-born defender joined Derby from Swindon in January 2016, the same month another prospect who has impressed Lampard, the winger Luke Thomas – previously coveted by Southampton and West Ham – arrived from Cheltenham. With Louie Sibley and Max Bird, too, Derby are not short of talent.The left-winger grew up in Leeds, played for Newcastle and scored his first league goal against Sunderland. But he is finding his feet at Boro, the club he joined at 13 and for whom he made his first-team debut four days after hitting a hat-trick for the under-23s. He started last year on loan at MK Dons but since returning to the Riverside the England Under-20s international has showcased further glimpses of his ability, predominantly off the bench for his club. Tavernier was briefly promoted to train with Gareth Southgate’s England squad in September, as cover for Raheem Sterling.Chris Powell has been careful not to amplify the noise around the energetic midfielder, though it has been impossible for his manager not to acknowledge the talents of a player who joined Southend aged 11. That Yearwood was named by Powell as captain for a game in November is a mark of his maturity, with his performances attracting attention from clubs including Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough. Yearwood earned an England Under-18s call-up in May but was forced to pull out with a hamstring injury. “This is the best place for Dru at the current time,” Powell said.There are stories of a 16-year-old Adshead doing his homework on the team bus to Millwall and having to get changed away from his Rochdale teammates owing to child protection regulations but, 12 months on from his full debut, his challenge is to cement a regular starting berth. Athletic and intelligent – he attended the same college in Gorton as Nicky Butt – Adshead was fast-tracked into the first team at Rochdale, with whom he first trained at 14. He signed a professional contract in September and as his manager, Keith Hill, said: “You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to know Dan’s got a great future.”Harper was a striker but academy staff at West Brom spotted glimpses of Patrick Vieira’s powerful style and moulded him into a box-to-box midfielder three seasons ago. Not even born when the former Arsenal midfielder lifted the World Cup with France in 1998, he made his debut 18 months ago. Harper has worked with Darren Moore, now head coach at Albion, since the under-12s so seemingly has the perfect manager to help him into the first team on a more regular basis. He impressed after being handed a starting berth in the FA Cup last weekend. “He’s got wonderful balance, his first touch and control is excellent, he moves the ball away from danger and he’s got the ability to put his foot on the gas,” Moore said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42d1a6bf9283d07048f5e0acc098d2c01e093d4/780_828_4692_2815/master/4692.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbcdee60c3fd73844018e0b532b3fba5","title":"shop see and scran a liverpool 24 hour guide","story":"The incomparable north-west city is renowned for its vibrant sights and nightlife. The main question is how to fit it all in? Our Scouse insider brings you the lowdownI might be biased but I’ve long held the belief that Liverpool is The Best City In The World™. Being a port city historically, it has all the multiculturalism (and variety and spice) of London, but the closeness, community and solidarity of a smaller community – one that faces challenges and adversity together. In other words, don’t mess with Liverpool we’re feisty.For a relatively small city, Liverpool has a lot going on. If you’re planning a visit – and you should, there are affordable trains running from London, Birmingham and elsewhere with London Northwestern Railway – it’s hard to know where to start. Here are my recommendations for 24 hours in Liverpool, from the old favourites you’ve definitely heard of to a couple of things that only a local would know.Eating out, or ‘going for a scran’ in ScouseApparently, breakfast is the most important meal of the day – and there’s nowhere better to kick off your trip to Liverpool than Brasco Lounge. It’s the perfect place to start the day and start falling in love with Liverpool.During the 1980s the Albert Dock was nothing more than derelict ruins, but thanks to some heavy investment it’s now the most picturesque spot in town filled with pretty shops, exclusive bars and some of the most expensive apartments in the city. Brasco Lounge faces this and has its back to the Pier Head (home to the iconic Liver Building). Inside Brasco you’ll find an eclectic mix of antiques, vintage art and reclaimed wooden tables all bathed in natural light. And what does natural light translate to? Unreal food pictures for “the gram”, that’s what. May I recommend the eggs benedict or florentine, which are the best of either I’ve ever had.If you’re arriving for lunch, grab a bite and quick pic at Love Thy Neighbour on Bold Street, which gets my prize for most creative use of pink paint in the city. Sitting at the end of a row of shops, it boasts a huge blank wall to the side – so they painted it pink and adorned it with illustrations and mantras, the most famous of which being “Avocado is bae”. It’s loved by locals, visitors and bloggers alike for its healthy food, designed to make you feel beautiful inside and out, and its unusual cocktails – beetroot bloody mary anyone? It’s a great place for a spot of lunch, people-watching and getting those all-important holiday snaps.For something a little more eco, there’s Down the Hatch, a vegetarian and vegan restaurant with a difference: it’s not berry bowls and kale sandwiches you’ll find here, it’s kebabs and hotdogs and pulled pork – all with the absence of meat. Many a meat-eater has dined here and sworn blind they couldn’t tell the difference.SightseeingEven if you’re of the opinion that bus tours are a bit on the touristy side, you can’t deny that they’re an effective way of cramming lots of sights and interesting facts into a limited amount of time: it’s efficient travelling. Liverpool has one very special, very Liverpool and very unique bus tour, though, and that’s the Magical Mystery Tour. The Beatles phenomenon remains a huge draw to the city and we’re all very proud of the four local lads who shook the world. Roll up, roll up for the Mystery Tour, even though it’s not much of a mystery that it’ll take you around all of the famous Beatles landmarks such as Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane. You’ll also get to see some other fantastic Liverpool sights along the way all in a warm, covered, Technicolor tour bus.Around 15 minutes north of the city centre, past the (still very active) docklands you’ll find Crosby beach, which is always full of people, no matter what time of the day or night – iron people to be exact. Anthony Gormley’s Another Place art installation features 100 iron men, all staring out to sea. It was supposed to be a temporary exhibit and move on to New York, but the people of Liverpool took these figures to their hearts and we’ve kept them. The locals make sure the beach is kept clean and tidy it’s our pride and joy. Visit here at sunset for an absolutely breathtaking view.For an architecture hit, stroll through the Georgian Quarter. There’s something about Georgian houses, particularly the windows that do things to me, and here you’ll find gorgeous windows, cobbled streets, ornate front steps and pretty blossom trees. It is without doubt the city’s most photogenic and aesthetically pleasing postcode and it’s perfect for an afternoon stroll. One of the houses on Falkner Street was recently featured on the BBC’s A House Through Time and anyone who’s into period properties and history will be in their element.Liverpool is a city that keeps on surprising you. I’ve only recently discovered the St James Gardens myself. Liverpool’s Anglican cathedral is the largest in the UK and the fifth largest in the world – you can climb the bell tower and take in the famous Liverpool skyline but what I would like to point out is actually ground level. By the main entrance you’ll find a winding path down into the cathedral gardens. Walking through a graveyard might not be for everyone, but there’s a strange sense of peace here. It’s as if the city around you stops existing. This is a wonderful place to catch your breath on your whirlwind tour of Liverpool. Added bonus: you’ll find a natural spring said to have healing properties here.ShoppingLiverpool One is the city’s beating heart of retail. Here you’ll find all your high street stores, restaurant chains and a bustling street scene. You can easily make a day of such retail therapy, grab a cocktail and unwind between stores (one of the real perks of taking the train). You certainly won’t be short of places to exercise that plastic – just don’t be alarmed if you see us Liverpool girls walking round in rollers, it’s just how we get ready for a night out, and here, hair is king. But if you’re after something a bit different, then at the edge of the Baltic Triangle you’ll find the old red-brick Cains Brewery building. It’s now a maze of vintage and antique shops and a recently opened indoor market, which is filled with local independent businesses. It’s quirky heaven – you’ll definitely find some unique souvenirs to take away with you, and maybe even some furniture.Located right next to the world famous Cavern Club is Cavern Walks, a tiny but exclusive shopping mall. This is where our Vivienne Westwood store is and of course, the footballers wives’ favourite, Cricket. You only have to Google Coleen Rooney or Alex Gerrard and one of the first pictures will no doubt be a photo of them swinging a Cricket store bag. If Balenciaga and Givenchy are your poison, then this is worth a swing by.Drinks and nightlifeI wouldn’t say Liverpool was image obsessed, but we appreciate a good aesthetic and we’re not afraid to go the extra mile to make things memorable, especially when it comes to our nightlife. Perhaps that’s why we’re host to The Florist, considered by some to be one of the most Instagramable bars in the UK. You won’t find a prettier place to sip a cocktail. There isn’t a square inch of this place that isn’t covered in some sort of floral arrangement, whether it be neon signs, spray paint or thousands of artificial flowers. Expect your cocktails to be garnished with real flowers (obviously) and make sure to try the hibiscus cooler, you’ll regret it if you don’t.Alma de Cuba, meanwhile, might look like a plain, box-shaped former church on the outside, but on the inside it’s one of the most ornately decorated bars you’ve ever seen and is a Liverpool nightlife institution. Early in the evening it’s a sophisticated cocktail bar and restaurant but as it gets late on a Friday and Saturday night you’ll find yourself caught up in a storm of confetti known as the petal drop then the atmosphere completely changes. The soul of Cuba arrives and you’ll find yourself up on stage burning calories faster than you can consume them with the sexy samba dancers and infectious Latin music.But there’s nothing more alluring than a secret bar and Liverpool has a few – the undisputed pick of the bunch being 81Ltd. Hidden at the top of a darkened staircase, behind a secret door in Salt Dog Slims bar and only accessible by a secret code that changes weekly, you’ll (maybe) find the tiny speakeasy bar, 81Ltd. With a maximum capacity of 60 people, it fills up fast. If you do manage to find it and you do manage to get in, try the Siberian truth serum cocktail.If you sample just one slice of Liverpool’s nightlife while you’re in the city, make it Bongo’s Bingo. These nights always sell out, so this is something you’d have to buy a ticket for in advance, but it is well worth the extra planning. Hosted by Johnny Bongo, this irreverent bingo night is all about the laughs generated by both the host himself and the ridiculous prizes up for grabs – you could be walking away with anything from a box of Coco Pops to a life-size cut out of Philip Schofield. Jeremy Corbyn himself was a recent guest host at Bongo’s Bingo and one lucky lady got to go home with a life-size, autographed cut out of the man himself. Expect plenty of dancing on the tables and glow sticks as well.Liverpool is a 24-hour city, so there’s plenty to keep you entertained until the first train home.

The direct marketing literature stated that it would not be Christmas without “the look on her face”.Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said the leaflet had been clearly designed to pull at the heart strings of the vulnerable, and was a “new low” for the payday lending industry.Reeves, who is the MP for Leeds West, said the company was clearly trying to exploit the financially vulnerable.On Monday she wrote to the head of the Financial Conduct Authority, Andrew Bailey, asking what action the regulator could take against Provident, in a bid to prevent such adverts appearing again.“I believe this was a cynical tactic to exploit vulnerable people who struggle financially at the best of times, let alone over the festive season. Provident tried to use a deliberately, emotionally loaded message to urge them to take out a loan at a rip-off rate of interest,” Reeves said.Last week the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the advert had been irresponsible, and it had targeted vulnerable consumers. The ASA ruled that it should not be used again.Reeves said she believed the ASA’s action had not gone far enough in tackling Provident’s behaviour, which is why she was writing to the FCA.In response, Provident said: “The ASA informed us of a complaint made about the advertisement and we subsequently removed it from circulation, prior to the ASA’s final ruling. Provident also provided assurances to the ASA that such content will not be used in any further marketing materials.”Provident previously told the ASA that credit was only issued “following a face-to-face meeting in a customer’s home, where their needs were discussed and where checks on affordability, suitability and sustainability were made”.In 2017, Provident Financial, as it was then called, lost two-thirds of its stock market value in a day, after the doorstep lender parted company with its chief executive and revealed it was facing an FCA investigation into its credit card business.In the same year it replaced 4,500 self-employed sales agents who went door to door, offering loans and collecting debts, with 2,500 full-time “customer experience managers”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a57f0151e054de95ddc36646215d2535108dbd01/0_82_1883_1129/master/1883.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf2e91e5a86b1ad20e19cd6503fcfa28","title":"kate bush clarifies political stance i am not a tory supporter","story":"Singer expressed support for Theresa May in 2016 but says she was simply celebrating a woman in powerKate Bush has written a statement clarifying her political beliefs, saying a magazine interview from 2016 “could make it seem like I am a Tory supporter, which I want to make clear I am not”.In the interview with the Canadian magazine Maclean’s, Bush was reported as voicing support for the British prime minister, Theresa May.Answering a question about Hillary Clinton and “the fear of women’s power”, she said: “We have a female prime minister here in the UK. I actually really like her and think she’s wonderful. I think it’s the best thing that’s happened to us in a long time. She’s a very intelligent woman but I don’t see much to fear. “I will say it is great to have a woman in charge of the country. She’s very sensible and I think that’s a good thing at this point in time.”Writing on her website, Bush says the quote was “out of context … it seemed as if the focus went on to the quote rather than the work. It was deeply frustrating.”She says she decided not to clarify her words at the time but was now moved to comment after the quote had been aired again in articles about her recently remastered back catalogue and a book of her collected lyrics. My response to the interviewer was not meant to be political but rather was in the defence of women in power. I felt he was putting a really negative slant on powerful women, referring to a witch hunt involving Hillary Clinton. In response I said that we had a woman in charge of our country, and that I felt it was a good thing to have women in power. I should have been clearer when I then said it was the best thing that had happened to us for a long time – because I greatly disliked the behaviour of the previous PM, who at that point I felt had abandoned us and everybody felt angry and let down.The latter reference is to David Cameron, who has been criticised for calling the referendum on Britain’s EU membership, which led to Brexit.Bush is still a relatively reclusive figure, and did no interviews around the recent reissues and lyric collection. In 2014, she performed her first live shows in 35 years, having not toured since her only ever run of live dates in 1979.She does write occasional messages on her website though, recently including tributes to the late recording engineer Geoff Emerick and the choreographer Lindsay Kemp.

It estimates there are 1,250 EU citizens and others who would need to apply to secure settled status to remain in the UK, at a cost of £80,000.The government has demanded that the 3 million EU nationals legally resident in the UK complete paperwork to prove their right to remain and access public services permanently after Brexit – and insisted that applicants pay £65 to complete the paperwork.Alison McGovern, a Labour backbencher, said the government should reverse its policy and pay the fee for its employees, adding: “The fact that the government has no idea how many European citizens it employs tells you all you need to know about the shambolic Brexit preparations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c49b714c69c5211395d519cc6a552cf635909d2/0_162_4172_2503/master/4172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a4750440bac5d72df507f49519ca86","title":"brexit latest news debate pmqs may corbyn grieve mps launch bid to ensure they vote on plan b within three days if mays deal defeated politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs and the first day of the Brexit debateChris Heaton-Harris, a junior Brexit minister, has been giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee this morning. Not all Brexit ministers are Brexiters (in the sense of being leave voters), but Heaton-Harris is. Here are some of the key points he’s been making.The legislation is set out now, and the fact that we have activated article 50, I actually still believe we will be leaving the EU on March 29 at 11pm. Is there a parliamentary route with which Brexit can be stopped? I do not believe so.Joanna Cherry, an SNP member of the committee, said this answer was “disgraceful”.Here is some snap reaction to the Bercow decision.From the ’s Steven SwinfordFrom the Sky’s Kate McCannFrom Nikki da Costa, who until recently was director of legislative affairs at Downing StreetFrom Jolyon Maugham, the Labour-supporting QC who organised the bid to get the ECJ to rule that the UK can revoke article 50John Bercow, the speaker, will allow MPs to vote on the Grieve amendment (see 9.05am), my colleague Jessica Elgot reports.There will be no delays at Calais if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the head of the port told the Today programme. Jean-Marc Puissesseau, who is president chairman of the ports of Boulogne Calais, was invited on to say if he agreed with what David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, told the Today programme yesterday about how France was much better prepared for a no-deal than the British media have been reporting. And Puissesseau agreed.Puissesseau conceded that there would have to be veterinary and phytosanitary inspections. But he said the ports were already building infrastructure for this.And he took a swipe at Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, saying that it was a “shock” for Calais to learn that the government was getting ready to spend an extra £100m ferry capacity in case the port could not cope. He went on:It is disrespectful to Calais and to Dover what has been decided by Mr Grayling and the British government ... This £100m - if Great Britain has too much money, they should give it to us, to help us to be more effective towards the migrants.But later on the same programme David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, disputed Puissesseau’s analysis. He said:Those are things that would do serious damage to employment and to living standards and to hopes of future prosperity and growth in this country.Here is my colleague Heather Stewart on whether or not John Bercow, the speaker, will allow the Greive amendment intended to allow MPs to vote on ‘plan B’ within three days if the Brexit deal is defeated. (See 9.05am.)And here is the ’s Steven Swinford on the same story.Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former chief whip, confirmed that he would vote against Theresa May’s Brexit deal this morning. He told the Today programme that it was “humiliating” and would “enshrine all those isions which have caused such trouble in Britain. He went on:It will perpetuate all the isionism which has led us to where we are today.Jeremy Corbyn will table a motion of no confidence in the government almost immediately if Theresa May loses the Brexit vote next week, Labour is now saying.This is what Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, told the Today programme this morning.We’re now talking as if it is expected that the government next Tuesday will be defeated on the most important piece of legislation that has come before parliament probably in 50 or more years, that the government has devoted two years of its time to try to negotiate, and we’re now almost accepting that this will simply be defeated and voted down.Obviously, the next thing to do immediately after that is for there to be a vote of confidence in the government. Until now Labour has been rather coy about exactly when it might table a no confidence motion, with senior figures saying it is important to wait until the moment when they judge they have the best chance of winning. After Gardiner’s interview one senior party source played down the idea that Gardiner was making a firm statement about a possible no confidence vote next week.But on Sky’s All Out Politics after 9pm Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities secretary and Labour’s co-national campaigner coordinator, also said that Labour would table a no confidence motion soon after the Tuesday Brexit vote if Theresa May loses. Asked if he could “guarantee” that Labour would table a no confidence motion in those circumstances, he replied:Well, we want a general election. And the only way you can get a general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act is to table a vote of confidence.When asked if he could guarantee this would happen, Gwynne said:In the event of Theresa May failing to get her deal through, we will be calling for a general election. And to do that, you have to table a motion of confidence.Sky’s Adam Boulton asked if that meant a confidence vote would come “next week, basically” if May lost the vote. Gwynne replied: “Absolutely.”David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May’s de facto deputy, used an interview on the Today programme this morning to accuse Brexiters of believing in “fantasies”. He told the programme:I don’t think that the British public are served by fantasies about magical alternative deals that are somehow going to sort of spring out of a cupboard in Brussels.This deal on the table has involved some very difficult give and take on both sides and if you go around and talk to the other EU 27 governments they will say that there are elements of this that cause them some political pain, but they are very clear, in conversations I have had with them as well as their public statements, they ain’t going to be going back and unpicking this for some brand new brilliant renegotiations. So, the choice that people have is this deal or it is no deal or it is, as some MPs advocate, to reverse the 2016 referendum entirely.Lidington seemed to be referring directly to David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, who used an interview on the Today programme only yesterday to claim that the EU would be willing to offer the UK an alternative Brexit deal if only the government pushed for it a bit harder.The Conservative MP and former minister Nick Boles has revealed that he received a death threat last night after voting for the amendment, that was passed, designed to limit the Treasury’s tax powers in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the BBC reports.Here is an extract from Boles’s short speech in the debate. Boles voted remain in the referendum, and since then has been pushing what at one stage was called the ‘Norway for now’ option, which has now morphed into ‘Norway plus’ (meaning leaving the EU, but staying in the single market and the customs union). In the debate Boles said:The Brexit news is coming thick and fast this morning. I will post a summary of all the developments in a moment, but this may turn out to be the most important one.Here is the agenda for the day.9am: The Commons Treasury committee publishes the government’s response to its report on the Brexit withdrawal agreement.9.15am: Chris Heaton-Harris, the Brexit minister, gives evidence to the Brexit committee about no-deal planning.12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.After 1pm: MPs begin their debate on the Brexit deal.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but mostly I will be focusing on Brexit, and the debate.

Her carers at MHA Weston and Queensway care home  in Stafford were determined to find a way to make her happier, so they decided to see if music would help.The care home, which is a specialist dementia care unit, has provided music therapy for more than 10 years, and these sessions have made a real difference to Pegg, according to care assistant Chloe Pugh. When Pegg, now 91, attended her first music therapy session in 2016, she was crying and unable to calm down. But immediately afterwards, Pegg was a “completely different person”, smiling and recalling dancing with her husband. “We can’t eliminate her anxiety completely, but we can help to alleviate the symptoms for Eileen, and help her engage more with what’s happening around her,” says Pugh. By singing and clapping along to music or playing instruments at her weekly one-to-one classes, Pegg is calmer, which has encouraged her to participate in other activities, thereby improving her appetite and mood.Pegg is not the only one to benefit from these sessions. More than 2,000 residents across MHA’s 84 care homes take part in regular music therapy groups. And it’s not just clinical music therapy that helps dementia patients: choirs, music groups and specialist apps are all beneficial.Music uses different parts of the brain from language, so can be used to communicate with people with dementia, even if they no longer speak or seem to understand others’ words. As a result, it can help them express feelings and ideas and interact with others. It also reduces social isolation and encourages more physical activity through dancing or moving to the music.Research published last year by the International Longevity Centre UK (ILC) and the Utley Foundation found that music has significant physical and mental health benefits for those with dementia and helps them retain their speech and language skills longer.“Analysis showed that music helps to significantly minimise some of the symptoms of dementia, such as agitation, and can help to tackle anxiety and depression,” says Sally Greengross, chief executive of the ILC. Little wonder then, that the government wants to expand the use of music for dementia patients, as part of its drive to expand “social prescribing”. The NHS long-term plan, published this week, promised to roll out social prescribing, including music and the arts. By April 2021, there will be over 1,000 trained social prescribing link workers and more in place by April 2024, with the aim that over 900,000 people are able to be referred to social prescribing schemes by then, the plan says. These link workers will connect patients to local groups and support services.“Research suggests music can help people with dementia reduce the need for medication or restraints, address agitation and help people and their families cope better with symptoms,” says the health secretary, Matt Hancock. “This is the kind of good value, easy-to-use social prescription that I’m fully behind and I fully support work that helps us move to more person-centred care – a key part of the NHS’s long-term plan.”But it comes at a price: the King’s Fund has pointed out that social prescribing can be more expensive to commission than seeing a GP in the short term. And on average, it costs MHA £30 per person for each music therapy session in its care homes. With social care finances stretched to the limit, music is not a priority at many homes, while the availability of community-based choirs and interactive music groups for dementia patients is limited. In a bid to make it easier for commissioners, care providers and patients to find out what services are available and to identify gaps, today sees the launch of the Music for Dementia 2020 campaign. The campaign’s website will share best practice and research and will have a searchable database of suitable music activities for dementia patients. “Part of developing the promotion of music for people living with dementia involves being smart about where we support resources, so we need to know where there’s already good work happening,” says Grace Meadows, the programme director at the Utley Foundation and a senior music therapist at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.Backed with £1m from the Utley Foundation, with additional ongoing annual funding of £500,000, the campaign aims to increase public awareness and backing for music to be an integral part of all dementia care pathways. The funding will finance local and national projects, scaling them up, helping to introduce music where there is currently little or no existing provision as well as training the workforce. “We want everyone in the UK living with dementia to have access to the music that means most to them and for it to be accessible in the most appropriate and effective ways,” says Meadows.“For some this will mean ensuring they have the right technology – allowing them to enjoy their favourite music wherever and whenever they want. For others it means being able to attend music groups and participate in music-making. For some, it may mean working with a music therapist. Music for people living with dementia isn’t a nicety, it’s a necessity.”Back in Stafford, Pugh is clear about the importance of music to the lives of those she looks after. “Music is and will continue to be the heartbeat of care for our residents,” she says.The Department of Health and Social Care wants to expand social prescribing in the arts. And there are many museums, theatres and galleries already doing local outreach work that could be harnessed by government and commissioners.Tyne \u0026amp Wear Archives and Museum runs three outreach programmes for health and wellbeing: one for those with mental health issues, another for supporting recovering addicts and those involved in the criminal justice system, and another for those aged over 55.The Holburne Museum in Bath runs a dedicated programme for those with mental health difficulties and homeless people. Participants, many of whom are referred from Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS trust, take part in professional artist-led classes such as oil painting, and ceramics and can progress to becoming volunteer museum guides too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10c971f0e061d8f1a4500fff36d01760cb2faa41/0_151_3677_2207/master/3677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b4c8ca93a53fe9a2d7695292b815123","title":"underarm serve between legs seals bernard tomic win over nick kyrgios","story":"It was with a certain degree of inevitability that the first official encounter on a tennis court between Bernard Tomic and Nick Kyrgios failed to pass without a whiff of controversy. After dominating a low-key hit-out in Melbourne, Tomic ensured post-match talk would not centre on the result but rather the comical manner of his victory after he played a sneaky underarm between-the-legs serve on match point.Tomic, who was once world No 17 but plummeted down the rankings during a period of decline that culminated in a brief appearance on a reality TV show last year, faced Kyrgios – no stranger to controversy himself – in a much-hyped pre-Australian Open exhibition match at the Kooyong Classic. Now ranked 85, Tomic proved sharper than the 51-ranked Kyrgios and put himself in a winning position with little fuss.Needing just one more point for victory, as he settled into his service stance, Tomic dropped a ball and hit it between his legs while continuing to bounce another ball, apparently in preparation to serve in the normal fashion. The unorthodox serve bounced in on the other side of the net, catching Kyrgios – as well as the umpire and the crowd at Kooyong – completely off guard.After a moment of deliberation, the umpire announced game, set and match to Tomic, leaving Kyrgios to laugh in bewilderment and shake his head as he moved off the court. “I don’t think there has ever been a player like BT,” Kyrgios said afterwards. “It is great to see him back out here as I know he was going through some rough times. He won a title last year and it looks like he is carrying a bit of momentum which is good to see.”The legality of the shot was not questioned by the umpire at the time, however according to the ITF’s rules of the game, underarm serving only allowed if the ball is struck before it hits the ground. Tomic’s effort appeared to bounce off the court before his racket struck it.The Queenslander failed to qualify for last year’s Australian Open but has won a place at next week’s tournament at Melbourne Park thanks to his improved ranking. “He looks happy, he looks healthy. That’s the main thing,” Kyrgios added. “You never want to see a talent like that go down and keep being down.”The hit-out lacked intensity but Tomic’s performance, particularly in the first set, was impressive, albeit coming against an opponent who appeared not yet to be up to tournament speed. Tomic broke Kyrgios in the fourth game of the match before going on to claim the first set and when he broke at 3-3 in the second, there was no looking back.Not all onlookers were impressed with what they saw on Wednesday, however. Australian Olympian Georgie Parker labelled the efforts of the players “an absolute joke”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce79692040fb7d88a93193a26b1c0abd4740f721/0_353_5520_3312/master/5520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e6a332db39d453a4c4e5cb8e8445a0","title":"paradise review dusty hughes sara kestelman hampstead theatre downstairs","story":"Hampstead Downstairs, LondonDusty Hughes’s play about two mischief-making seniors living in a retirement home is stoic about ageingGiven that nearly a fifth of the UK population is aged 65 or over, I suspect there will be a growing appetite for plays about old age. Alan Bennett in Allelujah! and Florian Zeller in The Height of the Storm have recently tackled the subject and now Dusty Hughes, in his first stage piece since 2000, has come up with a quietly touching summer-garden play about the penalties, and occasional pleasures, of growing old. But I suspect I shall remember the piece mainly for the performance of the ever-astonishing Sara Kestelman.She plays a green-fingered oldster called Goose and Geoffrey Freshwater an elderly gay man named Meakin: both are residents of a private retirement home and, having known each other since schooldays, exist in a state of friendly antagonism. But their chief delight lies in mocking, and shocking, their unseen co-retirees: he, in particular, loves to leave soft-porn magazines in the dining room. But the play’s only real crisis erupts when Goose is threatened with eviction by the home’s new manager over her inability to pay her bills: a situation that Meakin, who has accumulated a small fortune after living for 40 years with a famous artist, does little to alleviate.Not a lot happens in terms of plot. You often feel, especially when a sympathetic maid talks about her dead boyfriend and anarchic gran, that Hughes is marking time.His achievement lies in capturing the querulous co-dependence of the odd couple at the heart of his play and the mix of desperation and lack of inhibition that is part of old age. Meakin, looking back on his privileged past, says that he now feels: “Like a castle sacked by barbarians.” But he and Goose feel free to drink gin mid-afternoon, bitch about their contemporaries and split hairs about the sex lives of spiders.In Kestelman’s performance, however, it is Goose who emerges as the more complex character. We learn that she was a history teacher, that her savings were frittered away by her daughter and that she is still suffering the after-effects of a stroke. Kestelman conveys the humiliations of her condition such as being asked, after a memory loss, to name the current prime minister. But when she says that all the people she once was are still inside her, you grasp the compensations of age. Seeking affirmation from Meakin of his unspoken love for her, Kestelman cries “Lie to me” with an urgency that stirs the blood. With her close-knit helmet of white hair and rigorously attentive eyes, Kestelman gives a performance you won’t quickly forget.Freshwater captures well the rumbustious selfishness and capricious mischief of the misanthropic Meakin. Claire Lams as the home’s brisk new boss redeems an initially frosty character by suggesting it is no picnic coping with the wayward old and Rebekah Hinds reveals the compassion of the gossipy maid. Alice Hamilton, who directed Barney Norris’s Visitors, also confirms that she has a special gift for dealing with plays about senior citizens. Although the play has affinities with David Storey’s Home, it lacks that work’s visual and verbal poetry. What it does do, in its modest, slow-burning way, is remind us that it is perfectly possible to confront the privations of age with a stoic fortitude."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9859d400f41723dba49da8690a02b3506a1eb09/0_199_5384_3229/master/5384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afe786d78ee23acab41a6be8b6c551e0","title":"school bus leeds cultural community college slung low","story":"Arts education is in crisis but theatre company Slung Low has set up a pay-what-you-can community college, offering lessons in art activism, wood-whittling and much moreOn board a double-decker in Holbeck, a small revolution in cultural education is brewing. In this corner of Leeds, locals are learning for the love of it on a bus that has been converted into classrooms. Inspired by the education programmes that used to be run by the Women’s Institute and working men’s clubs, the Cultural Community College offers classes free at the point of use, without any obvious instrumental purpose – a gesture that is, in the current climate, quietly radical.The college is the brainchild of theatre company Slung Low and was born out of the company’s own experience of learning new skills while making Flood, a large-scale series of works for Hull city of culture 2017. “What we found is that when we learned stuff - no matter what it was - we were generally more confident about everything,” says artistic director Alan Lane. And so the company wondered if they could pass that confidence on to others.“We had this idea that we could open a college that would not be in any way useful for anyone’s occupation,” Lane explains. “That it would operate beyond the market, that it would be ‘pay what you decide’, and that we would teach as broad a cultural offer – from stargazing to blacksmithing and everything in between – as we could possibly finance.”And that’s just what the company has done. In its first term, the Cultural Community College has taught Holbeck residents how to make everything from vegetarian Indian food to furniture to documentary films. There have been courses on art as activism and CPR, as well as the stargazing and blacksmithing.People might wonder what a theatre company is doing setting up a college. For Lane, the answer is simple: “It’s the most useful thing we could do.” He adds: “We’ve never had a programme which has been so well received by the theatre industry. The college has really struck a chord.” The first courses were fully booked online within 48 hours, and Slung Low has been inundated with offers from artists who want to share their expertise.Over time, the idea is that the college’s members take ownership of the curriculum, with courses selected through a dialogue between Slung Low and the community. “It’s not pure cultural democracy,” says Lane, “but it’s definitely true that there are subjects and classes that people will be able to point to and say, ‘I told them to do that.’”It’s no coincidence that the Cultural Community College has appeared at a time when arts education is perceived to be in crisis. The exclusion of arts subjects from the English baccalaureate has led to a decline in their study at many schools, while the emphasis on so-called “facilitating subjects” has discouraged students from choosing arts A-level options. In his new book The British Betrayal of Childhood, former children’s commissioner for England Sir Al Aynsley-Green even includes the downgrading of arts education as one of the factors driving a “crisis in childhood”.Lane and his team were certainly conscious of the challenges currently facing arts education, but the Cultural Community College has an offer that’s distinct from the instruction provided by schools, universities and the education departments of theatres. Slung Low want to bring in people who may be put off by traditional learning environments, and so they’ve been thinking carefully about how and where their courses take place – hence the bus, aboard which some of the lessons are taught, as well as at the Holbeck (formerly Holbeck Working Men’s Club), Slung Low’s new HQ.Lane is reluctant to describe the course instructors as teachers instead he calls them talkers, or experts. “There is a failure of imagination going on at every possible level of society,” Lane suggests, “and that’s starting with children in schools, where we have decided that to learn to remember things is more important than to imagine things.” He adds that “the college is a kind of response to that failure of imagination, but it’s also very aware of not trying to replicate an arts education”.Unlike many of those fighting for arts education – including the signatories of a letter to the  last year expressing “grave concern” about the exclusion of the arts in schools – Lane does not fall back on the economic argument. For him, and for Slung Low, cultural learning is about confidence, citizenship and empathy. The real question is not what arts education can do for the nation’s finances, but what it can do for people and communities. “Does it make better citizens, and does that have any impact on all our lives?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/780cb7646e6f48e2a956e8a862f2d06f959f0b15/395_169_4542_2725/master/4542.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd877f1c91babad67b6d9e537548ff93","title":"commonism review birmingham rep","story":"Birmingham RepAndy Smith and Amund Sjølie Sveen imagine a future of radical equality and freedom in a performance that comes with its own manifestoBilled as a “performed conversation”, Andy Smith and Amund Sjølie Sveen’s Commonism is performance as an invitation to listen, to collectively take up space and to spend time imagining a future far different from our precarious present. They propose that commonism, as a principle or an idea, offers a potential future of both radical equality and radical freedom.For an hour, sitting at either side of a table, Smith and Sveen perform a scripted conversation distilled from their own lengthier exchanges. Pages are turned and ideas genially debated: economic systems and wealth distribution, politics and the demos, nations and borders, labour and automation.I doubt that much here would be new or controversial to anyone with a slightly left-leaning bent or a passing interest in the state of the world. There is, however, an open acknowledgment of the privileges that allow for two white, middle-aged men to stage a subsidised chat for a paying audience. And there is an understanding that an equal future for which they advocate will rightly necessitate that the stage be ceded to others.However, while Commonism might sedately look towards the horizon, in the interplay between its minimal theatricality and a sincere commitment to actual shared presence and collective potential, it also guilefully interrogates its limitations, politically and performatively.Smith and Sveen’s conversation culminates in the distribution of a handbook that contains the principles of commonism. Shifting from staged conversation to proclamation, copies are distributed to the audience. Read after the performance, unencumbered by even the most minimal theatrical trappings, one is struck at the text’s difference in register and how these ideas might now function beyond the stage. It is not a step-by-step guide, but having negated their own theatricality, these ideas, even abstractly, feel concrete and of the world. They sincerely invite us to do with them as they will.The manifesto features a quote from Sara Ahmed’s Living a Feminist Life, reminding us that “we” is “not a foundation but what we are working toward”.

China is a major trading partner, and Kazakhstan’s state media had generally avoided reporting on it. But activists say pressure for action has slowly built following international media coverage.The foreign ministry press office confirmed Kazakh media reports from December that China had agreed to let more than 2,000 ethnic Kazakhs leave. It did not say who could leave or why. They will be allowed to apply for Kazakh citizenship or permanent residency after their arrival in Kazakhstan, the email said.The Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.Chinese authorities in Xinjiang have launched a massive surveillance and detention campaign that has swept as many as a million people into internment camps. Former detainees have said they were forced to renounce their culture and faith and subjected to political indoctrination.The detentions have sent a chill over a tight-knit community of Chinese-born Kazakhs living in Kazakhstan. Many had left China to pursue business opportunities or educate their children in Kazakh schools as restrictions tightened in Xinjiang.Hundreds lost contact with relatives in Xinjiang, and many began writing letters and attending media conferences, hoping that greater publicity would help bring their loved ones home.Serikzhan Bilash, the head of the Kazakh advocacy group Atajurt, said he was warned by officials to halt his activities four times this summer but the warnings later stopped. In December, he was invited onto a popular Kazakh talk show for an hour, indicating growing tolerance of his work publicising the plight of detained Kazakhs.“I said that Chinese officials are dangerous for central Asia, for Kazakhstan,” Bilash said. “They’re starting to accept my opinion now.”Chinese officials announced last week that while they would not back down on what it sees as a highly successful de-radicalisation program, fewer people would be sent through.Gene Bunin, an activist who has collected about 2,000 testimonies from relatives of detainees in Xinjiang, estimated that about 20 people, possibly more, were allowed to return to Kazakhstan last year. Bunin has tracked another 70 or so who have been released from camps but confined to their home villages and prevented from leaving the country.“They’ve been getting released since September,” said Bunin, who lived in Xinjiang until last year. “I suspect it’s sort of an appeasement thing going on, where they’re trying to satisfy the relatives, to defuse tensions.”Those allowed to return so far have been largely Kazakh citizens or those with spouses or children born in Kazakhstan.One 23-year-old Kazakh citizen, who asked to be identified by her nickname Guli to protect her family from retribution, was able to return from Xinjiang in July after being separated from her husband and two children for more than two years. She said she broke down in tears after a Kazakh official called to say she might be able to return.“I thought I’d never be able to go back to Kazakhstan again, that I wouldn’t able to see my kids again,” she said. “I had lost all hope.”In recent months, Chinese-born Kazakhs in Kazakhstan have started to hear that their relatives in Xinjiang were being released from the camps. However, most of the relatives remain in Xinjiang under unclear circumstances, unable to leave for Kazakhstan.“I want to find a way to bring my entire family over to Kazakhstan,” said Adilgazy Yergazy, who heard one of his younger brothers had been released on 24 December but has not been able to leave China. “They’re all very scared.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdbc7f86edd730f2a6e7a4c4b0355b75ae0744d4/0_48_9000_5400/master/9000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62fbb57f081c00ee6bb534ee68fdf983","title":"oxfam criticises eu inhumane lesbos refugee camp moria","story":"Violence so bad that women wear nappies at night to avoid leaving tents, report saysThe EU has been strongly criticised over conditions in Greece’s largest refugee camp, where Oxfam reported women are wearing nappies at night for fear of leaving their tents to go to the toilet.The British-based NGO described the increasingly dangerous state of the EU-sponsored Moria camp on the island of Lesbos, where a 24-year-old man from Cameroon was found dead in the early hours of Tuesday as temperatures fell below freezing.Under a landmark deal agreed between the EU and Turkey in March 2016 to reduce the number of people arriving into the continent, refugees seeking asylum on Greek islands have been forbidden from leaving “hotspot” camps to travel to the mainland.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has hailed the deal as a success for thwarting smuggling gangs and reducing migratory flows.But as a result, about 15,000 men, women and children are stranded in Lesbos, Chios, Kos, Samos and Leros, the islands closest to Turkey.The report from Oxfam titled Vulnerable and Abandoned highlighted the failure of authorities at the Moria camp, where nearly 5,000 people live, to identify vulnerable refugees who are eligible for help.Since the resignation in November of the government-appointed doctor designated to make assessments of asylum seekers’ wellbeing, Oxfam claimed these failed to take place for at least a month at Moria, which at times last year was home to three times the number of people it was designed for.As a result, Oxfam warned “vulnerable people including survivors of torture and sexual violence are being housed in unsafe areas … Pregnant women and mothers with newborns are left sleeping in tents, and unaccompanied children, wrongly registered as adults, have been placed in detention.”Mothers are said to have been sent away from hospital to live in a tent as early as four days after giving birth by caesarian section, in a camp where fights break out regularly and two-thirds of residents say they never feel safe.“In a few extreme cases, women say they have resorted to wearing diapers at night to avoid having to go to the toilet after dark,” the report said.One woman, 36, from Cameroon, told Oxfam that people were randomly attacked at the camp.“Moria is a dangerous place for women,” she said. “Fights can start at any moment. At any moment you can expect a stone to your head, even if you’re just walking to the toilet or to your tent … I live in the closed section for women who are alone, but after 11pm the door is open, and anyone can come in because there is no security guard at night. Safety is a big issue for us.”A 24-year-old woman from Afghanistan said: “In the winter there is no warm water. We take showers over the toilet.”Renata Rendón, Oxfam’s head of mission in Greece, said: “It is irresponsible and reckless to fail to recognise the most vulnerable people and respond to their needs.“Our partners have met mothers with newborn babies sleeping in tents, and teenagers wrongly registered as adults being locked up. Surely identifying and providing for the needs of such people is the most basic duty of the Greek government and its European partners.”Rendón added: “European leaders have to face the fact that their current policy is perpetuating an inhumane reception system and putting refugees at risk. Rather than continuing to focus all their efforts on returning refugees to Turkey under the deal struck in 2016, EU member states should support Greece to improve conditions in the island camps and move people off the overcrowded islands and on to the mainland.”People seeking asylum are normally expected to undergo vulnerability assessments soon after arrival on the islands, but the medical and psychosocial screenings at Moria have been described as cursory at best due to a “severe shortage” of staff.Oxfam reported that for “many months”, there was just one doctor employed by the Greek government at the camp to assess the health conditions of as many as 2,000 new arrivals in one month, before the medic eventually quit.Even refugees identified as vulnerable and theoretically allowed to leave the islands are being trapped due to a lack of accommodation on the mainland, it is claimed.According to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, more than 4,000 people eligible for transfer were stuck in Lesbos and Samos in November.The slow asylum application process is also said to be condemning families to years in the camps, where people live in tents without hot water and electricity during winter.“Due to a lack of staff, many people who arrive now in Lesbos have their first asylum interview scheduled for 2020,” Oxfam reported.For some, open fires are reportedly the only way to keep warm in winter. The burning of plastic bags and bottles is said to create a “dangerous, smoky, acrid atmosphere”.Three asylum seekers died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the camp in January 2017 while trying to stay warm with makeshift stoves.Since September, about 11,000 asylum seekers have been transferred by ferry and coach to hotels and apartments on the mainland in an EU-funded scheme overseen by UNHCR.Stella Nanou, a spokesperson for the agency in Athens, said: “While efforts have been intensified to transfer people and Moria’s population has fallen below 5,000 for the first time since April last year, it is still twice over capacity.“There are people, vulnerable people, families and children, living in totally unsuitable conditions in the biting cold. We’re talking about human beings. The situation is very bad, very grave.”A commission spokesman said it had made €289m (£260m) available to the Greek government to “support migration management” and was following the situation on the Greek islands closely as the weather deteriorated.“We have repeatedly alerted the Greek authorities about the very challenging situation in the Greek islands and pointed to the urgency to address this situation, while always ensuring the availability of EU funds to help face those challenges,” the spokesman said.“Of course, the overall responsibility for managing migration flows in Greece, including in the hotspots, rests with the Greek administration. The commission provides support it does not replace the Greek authorities.“There is in particular an urgent need to winterise reception capacity and to decongest the islands by accelerating asylum procedures and increasing returns in parallel to the ongoing efforts to transfer those migrants to the mainland whose geographical restrictions have been lifted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/457d6ece11fadc21725ec58e19c75bbd928b17c7/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8c8e7b7044c9ced21a8aeac47a9848f","title":"venezuela nicolas maduro second term neighbours latin america","story":"The leftwing president is isolated in a region lurching to the right but despite national crisis a direct intervention is unlikelyIn a televised new year’s message to his atrophying nation, Nicolás Maduro struck an upbeat tone. “Victory awaits us! The future awaits us! And everything will be better!” Venezuela’s embattled president insisted, declaring 2019 “the year of fresh starts”.But the sandbags and rifle-toting troops that now encircle the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas suggest far less confidence about the days ahead, as Venezuela sinks deeper into economic ruin and political isolation and questions grow over Maduro’s future.Hugo Chávez’s 56-year-old heir – narrowly elected after his mentor’s 2013 death and then again in disputed elections last May – will begin his second presidential term on Thursday, amid intensifying international condemnation of what critics call his illegitimate and authoritarian rule.Last week, a regional bloc known as the Lima Group turned up the heat, with 13 of its 14 members announcing they would not recognise Maduro’s new six-year term and urging him to step down. Those countries included Brazil, whose new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is well-known for his hostility to Maduro and whose pro-Trump foreign minister recently called for Venezuela’s “liberation”.The US has also stepped up pressure ahead of what it calls Maduro’s “sham inauguration” with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, telling one Brazilian newspaper “several things” could be done to rid Venezuela of Maduro’s “unacceptable” regime. Pompeo did not specify what those “things” might be but the remark echoed Donald Trump’s thinly veiled threat that military action was possible if Maduro did not go voluntarily.Despite the rhetorical war – Maduro recently ordered his troops to prepare to rip out the hearts of “imperialist” invaders – observers still consider a foreign military intervention unlikely.“I don’t see boots on the ground,” said Matias Spektor, an international relations specialist from Brazil’s Getúlio Vargas Foundation.But after years of dawdling, regional patience does appear to be running out, as the situation in Venezuela deteriorates and Latin American politics swerves to the right under leaders such as Bolsonaro, Colombia’s Iván Duque, Chile’s Sebastián Piñera and Argentina’s Mauricio Macri.“The dynamics are changing and they are changing very fast,” said Spektor, calling the rise of those politicians decidedly bad news for Maduro.Spektor said the Lima Group’s unexpectedly firm declaration – which includes plans for financial sanctions, preventing top Venezuela officials entering their countries, and suspending military cooperation – appeared partly designed to persuade the Venezuelan military to abandon their commander-in-chief.“For the regime to collapse you need to get Maduro out of the country and you need to get the military to stop supporting the regime … The way you do that is by sending signals to the military that in the long run if they stick to Maduro and the regime they will lose power,” he said.Latin American governments did not want regime change imposed by outsiders “because they know full well it would backfire – but they do want to see regime change via peaceful means”.Under its new leftist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico has resisted joining the anti-Maduro offensive, a move decried by human rights activists and Venezuela’s opposition. “I don’t stick my nose into other countries’ affairs,” López Obrador said last week, emphasizing Mexico’s return to a foreign policy of non-intervention.But most Latin American countries are moving in the opposite direction, leaving Maduro increasingly friendless in a region his Bolivarian predecessor, Hugo Chávez, dreamed of uniting during the “pink tide” era of leftist rule.Brazil, in particular, looks poised to play a frontline role in the diplomatic push to force Venezuela’s president out. “In the early days of the administration, my understanding is that people in the Bolsonaro government want to send a very clear and unequivocal signal that Maduro’s costs in the region are about to go up,” said Spektor.Brazil’s foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, hinted at that harder line this week arguing: “You have to face the threats, and the main one comes from non-democratic regimes that export crime, instability and oppression. You can’t simply wish away dictatorships such as Venezuela and Cuba.”David Smilde, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group, said there was a growing sense that with the end of Maduro’s first term and growing regional pressure the crisis was entering a new phase: “But nobody really knows just exactly what it amounts to.“It’s one thing to say: ‘You’re illegitimate’. But how much does that mean in the end? It doesn’t look like any of the Lima Group members or the United States are going to close up their embassies or break off diplomatic relations,” he said.Maduro and his inner circle would be fretting over their increasing isolation “and that’s why you see them reaching out to the Russians and the Chinese continually”, Smilde said. But any international effort to engineer a peaceful transition would founder unless Venezuela’s fractured opposition united.“Until that happens, the government can kind of do whatever it wants – even a weak government can consolidate if it has no opposition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb1362a73daa1cd2ebfae3032bb40b3ce20d2c0b/0_23_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f14a06aaa76893672f30e0220e8c04d0","title":"what does 2019 hold for kim jong un and north korea podcast","story":"Kim Jong-un goes into 2019 with momentum to build on after last year’s historic meeting with President Donald Trump.

My apartment looks on to the government ministry that was invaded by insurgents driving a hijacked forklift truck on January 5th.The protest movement turned insurrection has come too close for comfort.I returned from a year-end holiday to find my neighbourhood in central Paris transformed. “The Future”, says graffiti on a shop in the boulevard St Germain, next to the circular A symbol of anarchy.The windows of my local Société Générale bank are shattered.The Banque Nationale de Paris protected its windows with plywood, on which the rioters listed the bank’s supposed sins, including “climaticide” and fomenting war in Sudan.Broken glass carpeted the street outside the cafe where I ate my first 2019 meal in Paris. I walked home past a scorched motorcycle, lying like a dead insect in front of Yves Saint Laurent headquarters.My Spanish concierge was traumatised by watching rubbish bins burning on the corner.My newspaper vendor said the yellow vests went on the rampage in our neighbourhood because they were pushed this direction by security forces.Most days, I go outside to find dozens of police vans lined up in surrounding streets. It’s like living in an armed camp.When the protests started in November, shops and banks would put plywood sheets over their windows late on Friday, then remove them on Sunday.Now they leave the protective siding in place, giving central Paris the allure of a shanty town.On December 29th, turnout for the protests dwindled to 12,000 nationwide. Many heaved a sigh of relief in the mistaken belief that the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) movement had been defused by president Emmanuel Macron’s promise of €10 billion to increase purchasing power.But on January 5th, 50,000 gilets jaunes came back with a vengeance. The demonstrations have morphed from a protest at (now cancelled) fuel taxes to a seditious movement that is determined to bring down the government.Prime minister Edouard Philippe announced on Monday night that he will deploy 80,000 police and gendarmes for “Act 9” on January 12th.But will hardcore anarchists and vandals really be deterred by legislation that would create a register for violent demonstrators, similar to the one for football hooligans?One of the most shocking images from the January 5th riots showed Christophe Dettinger (37), a former boxing champion, kicking a policeman on the ground on the Solferino footbridge over the Seine, and pummelling another policeman in the face.Dettinger had “liked” a photograph of Marion Maréchal, the rising star of the French far right, on his Facebook page. He risks five years in prison and a €75,000 fine.His supporters raised €117,000 for his defence by Tuesday morning, before the crowdfunding\u0026nbsp platform Leetchi closed the fund down. A similar fund, set up for the 1,050 police who have been wounded in riots, raised far less.In the old Guignols de l’info television show, the puppet version of former Trotskyist leader Arlette Laguiller promised in a soft voice to “string the bourgeois up by their entrails”.At three Christmas dinners I attended in Paris, I detected a frisson of fear in the French bourgeoisie, a premonition that we’d all be strung up.Virtually everyone I know likes Macron and detests the gilets jaunes. I could not understand why polls showed such high support for the protesters, until a colleague reminded me that in Paris, Macron won 90 per cent of the vote in the 2017 presidential election.Bourgeois means, literally, town-dweller. Most of the gilets jaunes are from the neglected countryside.Not by chance, they are attacking Paris, seat of the hated government, home to the ruling elite.On Monday, Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the populist Italian Five Star movement, urged the gilets jaunes, “Don’t let up!” His partner in government, Matteo Salvini, the head of the extreme right-wing League, expressed his support for “honest citizens who are protesting against a president ruling against his own people”.Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Rassemblement National (RN), formerly Front National, and an ally of Salvini, is the Chesire cat of the gilets jaunes movement. She is almost invisible, except for her smile.The demands made by RN in a statement this week are virtually identical to those of the gilets jaunes: the dissolution of the National Assembly and new elections based on proportional representation, which would probably hand the RN a third of the seats in the French legislature."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

While the Globes’s ision between genres – Drama and ComedyMusical – make it less of a sturdy indicator of what’s to expect from the Oscars, the Baftas\u0026nbsptend to be a better indicator of what to expect.\u0026nbspThis year, the race has come down to Bradley Cooper\u0027s A Star is Born and\u0026nbspAlfonso\u0026nbspCuarón\u0027s Roma, although UK production The Favourite is in the lead with 12 nominations, thanks to its boost in both the acting and technical categories.\u0026nbspHere are the five biggest talking points from this year\u0027s Bafta nominations. The ceremony will take place on 10 February at the Royal Albert Hall, hosted for a second time by Joanna Lumley.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt appears the Queen biopic’s surprise win at the Golden Globes was something of a fluke. Although Rami Malek is still nominated in the Best Actor category for his portrayal of frontman Freddie Mercury, the film itself lost out on the top prize, with the category instead being populated by BlacKkKlansman, The Favourite, Green Book, Roma, and A Star Is Born.The revelation has essentially reconfirmed that the Best Picture is prize is a two-horse race between Roma and A Star is Born. The latter’s lack of wins on Globes night – outside of the inevitable Best Song prize for “Shallow” – suggests Alfonso Cuarón’s Mexico-set drama has the edge, but the Baftas will be key in solidifying the real odds for Oscar night.Created with Sketch.The 15 best films of 2018 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film. On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film.

It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Back in 2012, the howling omission of Olivia Colman from the Baftas’ Best Actress category, for her beautiful, devastating performance in Paddy Considine’s Tyrannosaur, made headlines. Her Peep Show co-star David Mitchell even called the decision “ridiculous”. When Meryl Streep went on to win for her role as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady, in which Colman also appeared as Thatcher’s daughter Carol, she took to the podium and dubbed her co-star “inely gifted”.Clearly, she knew then what the Baftas have only now cottoned onto – that Colman was destined for greatness. Thank goodness they’ve not made the same mistake twice Colman is nominated, and will most likely win, for her role as Queen Anne in Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite.As was the case with the Golden Globes, and as will no doubt be the case when the Oscar nominations are announced, there is not a sole woman on this year’s Best Director list. Where is Debra Granik’s nomination for Leave No Trace, her powerful, understated follow-up to Winter’s Bone? What about Marielle Heller, whose film, Can You Ever Forgive Me?, got an Adapted Screenplay nod, and earned Richard E Grant a Supporting Actor nomination.Perhaps the most disappointing omission, though, is You Were Never Really Here director Lynne Ramsey. Given that the Baftas are usually champions of homegrown talent, it seems they’ve missed an open goal by failing to give the Scottish filmmaker her due recognition.This year\u0027s Baftas nominations list in fullThe Favourite and A Star is Born dominate Bafta nominationsEverything you need to know about the 2019 BaftasOne of the less expected films to be honoured with several nominations here is Paweł Pawlikowski’s Cold War, a passionate love story set in the ruins of post-war Poland, as a man and a woman from vastly different backgrounds – separated by both politics and the machinations of fate – cross paths. The film earned a nomination for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Not in the English Language.Pawlikowski won the award for Best Director at last year’s Cannes Film Festival and has been selected as Poland’s entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Whether it will earn nominations in any other categories at the Oscars is hard to guess.Given that this year, Brits dominated even at the Golden Globes, it would have been unforgivable for the Baftas to fail to recognise homegrown talent. The Favourite’s Rachel Weisz and First Man’s Claire Foy have earned Supporting Actress nominations, and of course The Favourite’s Olivia Colman has been nominated for Best Actress.As many surprised Golden Globes viewers were reminded earlier this week, Vice’s Christian Bale – nominated for Best Actor – is also, in fact, British, while this year’s obligatory idiosyncratic curveball is Steve Coogan’s nomination for Stan \u0026amp Ollie. The fact that there’s an Outstanding British Film category, meanwhile, means that brilliant films like Beast and You Were Never Really Here, which might otherwise have been ignored, get to share a little of the spotlight too.One of the more curious omissions from this year’s nominations is Barry Jenkins’s If Beale Street Could Talk, although it’s been recognised in both the categories for Original Music and Adapted Screenplay. The James Baldwin adaptation hasn’t quite picked up the same level of buzz as Jenkins’s previous film, Moonlight, although Regina King has so far been the favourite to win the Academy Award for Supporting Actress, so it’s unusual to see her not even make the nominations when it comes to the Baftas.Amy Adams, Claire Foy, Emma Stone, and Rachel Weisz have all been nominated as expected, King’s place in the category has apparently been taken by Margot Robbie for her performance as Queen Elizabeth I in Mary Queen of Scots – presumably a case of a little preferential bias for a Brit production.You can read the full nominations below.\u0026nbspHello and welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of the 2019 Bafta nominations.\u0026nbspBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch\u0027s Will Poulter\u0026nbspand and I, Daniel Blake\u0027s Hayley Squires will reveal the nominations from the Baftas headquarters\u0026nbspnear Piccadilly Circus in London.\u0026nbspAnimated Film\u0026nbspIncredibles 2Isle of DogsSpider-Man: Into the Spider-VerseFollow\u0026nbspIndependent Culture\u0026nbspon Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and moreEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Its seasonal\u0026nbsptrading update rather cemented its\u0026nbspstatus as the supermarket sector’s current problem child.\u0026nbspCEO Mike Coupe said Christmas came late for the grocer. Critics immediately questioned whether it came at all.\u0026nbspSales for the 15 weeks to January 5 fell by 1.1 per cent excluding fuel, driven by a 2.3 per cent decline in general merchandise, for which read clothes and the stuff that Argos sells.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSainsbury\u0027s, Asda playing with fire by taking CMA to judicial reviewSainsbury\u0027s labels items needed by food banksFood did better, but a 0.4 per cent increase is hardly anything to shout about.\u0026nbspThe chain is still seeing action at its convenience stores (up 3 per cent) and online (twice that).\u0026nbspBut those numbers only serve to underline how poorly its big supermarkets are faring.\u0026nbspWorryingly, the grocer is beginning to establish a reputation for foul ups.\u0026nbspOnline, customers have complained about empty shelves at some of the stores. Then there was the PR debacle of the recently launched ‘wellness’ hubs. The reception was less than positive, not least when high profile commentators spotted sugary cereal bars that were, mistakenly we were told, included in the range.Isolated incidents? Perhaps. But too many of them and you start to develop a decidedly unhealthy narrative. \u0026nbspAs for that general merchandise, Argos has on occasion showed itself to be one of the better arrows in Coupe’s bow, but Sainsbury’s decided it would go easy on Black Friday discounting with entirely predictable results.\u0026nbspThe only consolation? It could have been a lot worse. Asos, the online clothes retailer, chose the same course and ended up having to issue an ugly profit warning. Retailers not named Amazon must wish they could send the event back to the US from whence it came. They should be so lucky.\u0026nbspYet again Coupe’s Sainsbury’s has given the distinct impression that it is drifting, with its executives focused on driving through the controversial planned merger with Asda at the expense of the core business. The latter has also had its troubles but recently it has been showing signs of life and is starting to look like Sainsbury’s saviour.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable.

CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CH“My response to the interviewer was not meant to be political but rather was in the defence of women in power,” she continued in the statement on her website. “I felt he was putting a really negative slant on powerful women, referring to a witch hunt involving Hillary Clinton. In response I said that we had a woman in charge of our country, and that I felt it was a good thing to have women in power.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The British empire was seen by others around the globe as the cornerstone of its stability (imperial injustices aside). This view arose from the former British colonies’ familiarity with British troops, British industry and trade, as well as British soft power (the royal family and BBC) and what it used to mean for them, for their past and future.However, the increasing dominance of the US moonlight’s beam in the 20th century meant, naturally, the sunset of the British hegemony. Since the Americans grabbed the world’s remote control, there has been a reset – with the world order drastically changed in the American direction. And the world has received the new American cultural reality with few apparent\u0026nbspconflictions, except one, the British legacy. British officials, institutions and soldiers may have left their ex-colonies, but their imprint has remained.Due to its intertwining impact on the future and welfare of people in the UK, Brexit has tended to be seen, from abroad, as a local mess with no immediate implication anywhere else. Is it true though? Are citizens in other parts of the world immune to the effects of Brexit’s shrapnel? In any event, do people elsewhere care about us? Certainly it might be reasonable to think that it’s important to know what they make of us and of our country.350m a week for the NHS became a defining symbol of the Brexit referendum campaign (Getty)Many people in Britain see their country in mayhem, but they don’t necessarily know what to do to get themselves out of Brexit\u0027s snare (not even the government appears to have an answer, nor most of those who voted for EU withdrawal). The confusion over the outcome of the referendum in 2016 – which is psychological at its core – has been so powerful that it has split society in two. Some are doomed to see Brexit as a Noah’s Ark others are ready to put a big hole in it below the water line.But if you think we in the UK are confused, it should be said that people around the world follow events without having any clue about what on earth is happening here. Wherever you go now, the question on everyone’s lips is along the lines of: why are the British muddling themselves into this most abhorrent and unjustified self-harm?Brexit casts a dark cloud over our experts’ predictions for 2019Do not get me wrong, people from all over the globe watch the BBC too. Many are still able to form some sort of opinion on the subject. Indeed, given the complexities involved, this has created a paradoxical reality where someone in Nicaragua can be as educated on Brexit as a Brexiteer from the midlands of England. It’s not the information that people lack, it’s their ability to absorb (and perhaps contextualise) it.For many beyond our shores, the right acronym for this dogged quandary which the UK has been juggling with for two and a half years is political “civil war”. This might be a bit over-amplified, but it is, indeed, some kind of a war waging, but in a civil manner.Yet the outcome of the British conflict over Brexit still might, as the UK did in the past, play a role in forming the world’s reality. Exiting the EU has set a different course for the post-Second World War\u0026nbsporder a course which could end up setting Europe ablaze.People on the other side of the English Channel have certainly grown very sceptical about British integrity when it comes to doing business of any kind. There is no point signing a deal with a nation that appears unable or unwilling to honour its word on previous European deals it has been part of. This is what Britain’s image abroad has become in some quarters.Take the Norwegians as another example. Once a “Norway-style” option became a possible alternative to Ms May’s Brexit agreement, Norwegian politicians panicked mainly because, after turning our back on the EU, they duly thought that Britain could get Norway’s ship scuttled too. Many in Europe just don’t trust Britain anymore. They increasingly think that the British gamble over leaving the EU could wreak havoc on their own present and future.But Europeans are not alone. Americans watch Brexit with horror too. Well, not all Americans, but especially those who did not vote for Donald Trump. Trump supporters see Brexit as a victory on the same historical scale as their waggish president’s inauguration. But on the other side of the US political scene, life is gloomier.In fact, Brexit didn’t promote ision and fear only in Britain it also helped to create two Americas. One understands that Britain had no need whatsoever to depart the EU in order to deepen its ties with the US, as those disingenuous leavers are still trying to argue. This America represents the liberal institutions, most branches of officialdom and those who see the benefits of globalisation.Nevertheless, Trump is still pushing Britain to crash out with no deal, claiming that an endorsement of Ms May’s Brexit deal would mean the UK losing out on a favourable bilateral trade agreement with the US. This is not an off-the-cuff claim: it is a real bid from the most powerful man on the planet to sabotage the UK’s “special” relationship with America by feeding his own nationalist agenda.An opinion poll by Emerson College, published at the end of last year, showed that 91 per cent\u0026nbspof Americans support the “special relationship”.However, it seems that Americans have lost their faith in Britain as a trade partner. While\u0026nbspa majority still support a bilateral free trade agreement with the UK after Brexit, the poll showed that many in the US don’t think that Britain is a trustworthy partner to do business with. Of the respondents, 48 per cent\u0026nbsprated China as the most important trading partner for the US (76 per cent\u0026nbsphad China in their top two), and 20 per cent\u0026nbspwent for Canada first. Only 6 per cent of respondents saw Britain as the top trade partner (behind Israel and Australia too).Does the relationship, under Trump, still sound “special”?The other America – Donald Trump’s America – does not spare any thought to what’s happening abroad: it simply wants to take back control, supports building a wall on its border to stop immigration, chants “America first”\u0026nbspand wants to ditch multilateral institutions, such as Nato and the EU. It rings a bell, right?However, the association of Brexit’s bad boys with Trump’s presidential campaign was not the ultimate eye-catcher in terms of foreign involvement in the UK’s decision to split from the EU. What was most notable was capturing Nigel Farage and Arron Banks, and other leavers, in the same bed with Russia.Indeed, the alleged efforts of Banks and Farage to foster contact with both Russian officials and Trump’s campaign have raised concerns among investigators in the UK and the US.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit has so far proved to be a zero-sum game, and the only nation still in love with zero-sum games is Russia. There should be no doubt by now that Brexit will only play into Russia’s hands. The very notion of “apocalyptic Europe”\u0026nbsphas informed the national belief system of the poker-faced Russian president Vladimir Putin for years. Stumbling out of a humiliating defeat at the end of the Cold War, the ex-KGB officer always saw a united Europe as another Soviet Union, but on the other side of the game.Ostensibly, it looks like this assumption has a Russian government monopoly, but, as time passes, skies are becoming cloudier. Putin managed to manipulate the Russian people into his antagonised theory through fuelling acrimony towards the west. This has been always a key tactic, which has proved efficient in turning ordinary citizens – more or less compelled as they are to consume constant, malicious propaganda – to believe that Brexit can turn the wheel in Russia’s favour. It’s so obvious from every angle in the globe – except where Brexiteers sit, of course – that Russia can’t wait but to see us out (for its own ends).No wonder Moscow has been meddling in Brexit from day one. The US Senate published a report in January last year noting that UK campaign finance laws do not require disclosure of political donations if they are from “the beneficial owners of non-British companies that are incorporated in the EU and carry out business in the UK”. This opacity, the report suggested, “may have enabled Russian-related money to be directed with insufficient scrutiny to various UK political actors”.This came as experts from the University of California at Berkeley and Swansea University identified 150,000 Twitter accounts with Russian ties that had been spreading messages on Brexit, which is not even to mention the Russian-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik’s extensive and “systematically one-sided coverage” of the Brexit debate, as the Senate report put it.Russian fake news teams targeted Mueller to discredit Trump probeBut Russians don’t really like these “accusations”, and robustly defend their government’s theory no matter what (and its denial of involvement). “We all agree that the Russian government has nothing to do with Brexit, and didn’t intervene one bit. We are stunned by these accusations,”\u0026nbspElena Sobonina, a Moscow-based expert on Russia’s foreign policy, told me.“We are Europe’s closest neighbours, therefore stability of the continent is crucial for us. We can’t afford playing this game, but if you want to know who is really working on weakening the EU and Nato you have to look west, to the US”, she said. “Everyone in Russia believes so.”Russians can point to Trump as Europe’s biggest rival, they can also claim that they are the champions of the EU’s stability but in Putin’s eyes, Britain will always be a special enemy. \u0026nbspThe poisoning of the ex-double agent Sergei Skripal in March last year in Salisbury helped Putin’s close circle to make the case to ordinary Russians. While wacky politicians, like Boris Johnson, were turning the show into an outcry for their own self-indulgent political tactics, Putin was mobilising Russia’s citizens – through their natural sense of grievance since the collapse of the Soviet Union – against Britain and what it represents.Britain’s hard stance on Russia – that it was to blame for the attempted assassination and ought to be punished – sent a message to Balkan and former Soviet nations that they would not be on their own, that Britain would not abdicate its responsibilities towards this part of the world, where people still perceive Russia as a threat. A young Lithuanian told me: “Old people, who lived under the Soviet occupation, do not invest in a home or\u0026nbspland because they still think the Russians will, eventually, come over and take everything away.”However, the way in which Britain’s position was perceived in ex-Soviet spheres of influence also uncovered a huge sympathy towards Russia and Putin’s cause in countries seen as crucial for Britain after Brexit, like China.British politicians have rarely been able to understand China due to a major misconception about its intentions. Ironically, Britain – the liberal empire which used to dominate the world – is plagued by isolationism and xenophobia, while the ex-communist acropolis, China, is becoming ever more free market orientated, undertaking a systematic process to liberalise trade.What I learned about Brexit inside the school for the French eliteDuring his visit to Beijing last summer, the\u0026nbspchancellor Philip Hammond seemed to be presenting Britain’s letter of credence to the Chinese, as they become the champion of free trade. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAnd sure enough, despite seeing Brexit as an imminent threat to the world’s economic stability, Chinese leaders still see it as a potentially big opportunity. Chinese businessmen, especially, believe it is a good idea to take advantage of the British “national desperation” to sign free trade deals. This promise, which has always been at the core of Brexiteer’s arguments for leaving the EU campaign, created Britain’s vulnerability in the eyes of pushy China. Chinese president Xi Jinping will trade with Britain, but this time on his own terms.In truth though, while China and the US are locked in a trade war, Britain’s dreams in the east seem diminished for now. Post-Brexit Britain will increasingly become dependent on the US (probably on Trump’s terms), and as long as Trump is in the Oval Office, the likelihood of any trade deal with China is minimal.As for ordinary Chinese craftsmen and small business owners, who look to foreign markets to sell their goods, many wonder why their British equivalents would countenance running away from the EU, the biggest market in the world. Asked about Brexit and how people back home see it, a Chinese restaurateur in London’s Chinatown told me: “People don’t get it! They just sit there mocking the British and having a laugh at them.”The real laugh is that Brexiteers are trying to sell a globalised “new” Britain, while leaving the very European organisation that still holds the global liberal system together and that is at the heart of global trade.According to the same diplomat, “Arab leaders want Britain to stay in the EU because they know that Brexit will hit its role on the international stage really hard, and subsequently we, in the Arab world, would have a lot at stake”.For Gulf countries particularly, trade with Britain is indisputably important. But in a region where stability (such as it is) still relies heavily on the US and the UK, any radical change in these two countries’ roles on the global stage would reflect heavily on the area. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“In the GCC, those who are traditionally bigger proponents of regional organisations see Brexit as a threat to regionalism tout-court, and see … the potential weakening of the EU as mirroring or anticipating the weakening of the GCC,”\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspCinzia Bianco, a researcher on Gulf-European relations at the University of Exeter.“This is especially because the GCC, for a period during the early 2000s, looked at the EU as a potential model in certain aspects,”\u0026nbspshe adds.Those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the Mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideasMany in the Gulf believe the UK was never meant to be part of the EU, and saw the UK as something different. According to Ms Bianco: “This is mostly due to the historical background of the UK being a semi-colonial power in the Gulf: GCC countries, therefore, have traditionally dealt with London on a bilateral level, with strong defence, political and economic relations, and very rarely through the EU.”This might explain why the Arab media is pretty much obsessed with Brexit. All the big ones – Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya, Sky News Arabia, Al Ghad – and even local news channels now follow Brexit more than Syria or Libya’s bloody civil wars.But when you participate in a Brexit debate on one of these channels, the pressing question they all ask is: “Do you think another referendum will take place?” It sounds like Arabs, for some reason, want Britain to stay in the EU more than British people themselves. This interest is reflected in the number of Independent readers from the Middle East who are keen to read about the subject. Brexit is our best-read topic in Egypt.Why might this be? Maybe it is a subconscious sympathy hammered out of an historical feeling of association (for good or ill) with Britain’s affairs. Maybe it is a genuine fear that if Great Britain exits the EU, it will not be great again and its role in the Middle East will be diminished.An Arab diplomat reflected ironically on the question when I put it to him: “Maybe our people are afraid of European immigration if Brexit would, at some point in the future, result in the collapse of the EU.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

Most seem to be aware, despite the extensive coverage, of nothing more than the bare fact that Brexit means Britain would be walking away from the EU. But their favourite question remains: “But, why?” And that is a good question indeed.“The reason why Brexit hasn’t been on the ordinary Arabs’ top of the agenda is that it happened in conjunction with what is called ‘the Arab Spring’, including the Syrian, Yemeni, and Libyan civil conflicts,”\u0026nbspsays Mohamed Kawas, a prominent French-Lebanese journalist.“On governments’ level, those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In fact, in their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideas”, he adds.It should be clear by now that Brexit is not just a local British dilemma. It will not only change people’s lives here, but in some other parts of the world too – directly or indirectly. This is due to its strategic and economic impact on Europe’s stability, Britain’s position on the world’s stage, and how Brexit will help Russia to rise again as a superpower in a new bipolar order.It is notable too that whereas the English language has always been a big help in making local issues, especially in the UK and the US, explicable internationally, the complexities of Brexit (and its inane explanations) did the opposite. For many outsiders, debate about Brexit remains something their eyes can see but their minds can’t process.Still, it has been the UK’s global standing as a nation of good repute that has been hit most. Those who always looked up to this country and its democratic and liberal values are united with those who loathe its imperial history and disastrous foreign policy decisions, such as the invasion of Iraq. Both sides – allies and foes – are now sceptical about Britain’s integrity and honesty, and doubtful about the extent to which other nations can any longer follow Britain’s leadership.\u0026nbspOf course, the British people themselves still have to get their heads around Brexit before anyone else. But whatever the outcome, it will not change the new reality:\u0026nbspthe damage is done, and Britain is not great anymore.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But here we were lucky, and caught this one, and can now study it in more detail.”Even despite being called small by the scientists who found it, the world is still huge compared to us: it is about three times our size, and\u0026nbsp23 times as massive. That puts it in the category of a sub-Neptune, and means that it would be the first roughly Earth-sized planets to have been found by TESS.But it is unlikely to look much like our own planet. It\u0027s probably made of gas like Neptune or Uranus, though something far more dense than their atmospheres.“We think this planet wouldn’t be as gaseous as Neptune or Uranus, which are mostly hydrogen and really puffy,” Dragomir says. “The planet likely has a density of water, or a thick atmosphere.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Theoretically, this means MPs will vote on the motion later today.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBercow is expected to outline his reasoning shortly after prime minister\u0027s questions.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSenior Conservative MP Nick Boles has told the BBC that he has\u0026nbspreceived\u0026nbsphis first death threat after he was one of over a dozen Tories to vote against the government in the Finance Bill on Tuesday evening in a move to signal opposition against a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt doesn\u0027t appear the DUP will be swinging around to save the prime minister before next week\u0027s crucial vote on the Brexit deal.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSpeaking on Sky News, the DUP\u0027s\u0026nbspBrexit spokesperson, Sammy Wilson, said:\u0026nbspThe only deal that could swing the DUP round is if the backstop as it applies to the UK as a whole or to Northern Ireland specifically were removed from this agreement.\u0026nbspHe added: Constitutionally and economically if this deal went through it would be ruinous and indeed would do what the IRA failed to do over 40 years of a terrorist campaign.Former Tory Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell\u0026nbsphas described May\u0027s Brexit deal as humiliating and said he would not vote for it as it stands.He told the Today programme the deal would enshrine all those isions which have caused such trouble in Britain, adding: It will perpetuate all the isionism which has led us to where we are today.Theresa May today faces the prospect of a fresh threat to her Brexit plans (yes, another) as MPs launch a bid to force her to reveal her plan B within just days if she loses the critical vote the deal next Tuesday.Under the current plan, if Ms May\u0027s deal is defeated in the Commons, the prime minister has 21 days, plus seven sitting days, to return to the chamber and offer MPs an alternative, or another vote.\u0026nbspBut the amendment to the business motion launched by cross-party MPs makes clear she will be required to return within three days of losing the vote.\u0026nbspThe MPs claim the situation is too urgent to potentially wait until 12 February for the next step.It is not yet clear whether the speaker, John Bercow, will select the amendment for MPs to vote on later today, but we will know for sure later in the afternoon.\u0026nbspIt follows a humiliating defeat for Ms May less than 24 hours ago, as rebel MPs won a vote making it harder for ministers to force through a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspSignificantly, her government became the first since 1978 to be defeated on a Finance Bill.Barry Gardiner, Labour’s international trade spokesman, suggested Jeremy Corbyn would table a vote of no confidence in the government “immediately” after the expected defeat for the deal next Tuesday, in an attempt to force a general election.\u0026nbsp“The next thing to do, immediately after that, is for there to be a vote of no confidence in the government,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.\u0026nbsp“The appropriate time to table a vote of no confidence in the government is when the government loses its key legislation and no longer commands a majority in the House of Commons.”\u0026nbspMr Gardiner said the “country should be demanding a general election”, arguing that would happen “in any other country around the world”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Extinction Rebellion demands that the UK government reduces to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and creates a citizens assembly to oversee changes in environmental policiesEngland batsman Jonny Bairstow celebrates after reaching his century during Day One of the Third Test match against Sri Lanka at Sinhalese Sports Club in ColomboPrime Minister Theresa May joins a parent and baby group during a visit to the Kentish Town Health Centre in LondonA crashed car, with an object protruding through the windscreen, sits abandoned on the A628 in the Peak District, as a blast of snow hit the north of EnglandWaves crash over Seaham lighthouse near Durham as the cold and wet weather continues“If some of those MPs can be persuaded to back the prime minister’s deal, it won’t be because they’ve come under pressure to do so from their local party members over the Christmas break,” said Prof Bale.\u0026nbspThe study found that 59 per cent of Tory members opposed Ms May’s deal, compared to 38 per cent who supported it and 3 per cent who did not have an opinion.More than half, 53 per cent, also said that the deal “does not respect the result of the referendum”, comparing to 42 per cent who said that it does.People were then asked how they would vote in a referendum where there were three options – to remain, leave with the deal or leave without one – and in which they are able to put down a first and second preference.Some 57 per cent opted to leave with no deal as their first choice, with only 23 per cent putting Ms May’s deal and 15 per cent backing the option to remain in the EU.Forty per cent\u0026nbspthen put the prime minister’s proposals as their second choice, with 19 per cent putting no deal and 6\u0026nbspper cent opting to stay as a member of the bloc.The survey showed large majorities of members think both that a no-deal Brexit will have a positive impact on the economy in the medium to long term and that warnings of disruption have been exaggerated.A slim majority, 51 per cent, said they thought Ms May was doing “well”, but almost as many, 48 per cent said she was doing “badly” to some degree.But despite wavering support for Ms May and her deal, an overwhelming majority of members – 83 per cent – opposed the idea of having an election, while 82 per cent would not back a further referendum.Yesterday, the prime minister’s Northern Irish partners in government raised the stakes further in the Brexit talks, saying there is “no need” for key parts of the deal she agreed with the EU.Nigel Dodds, DUP deputy leader,\u0026nbspargued that the withdrawal agreement she is seeking “flies in the face” of the government’s own commitments relating to the border between the north and the republic.His comments came after a meeting in Downing Street, and are a blow to the prime minister as she desperately tries to convince the Northern Irish party and her own MPs to back her proposals ahead of a vote in the coming weeks.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But with the Brexit process having descended into chaos, the prospect of an extension to the period is now being talked about, including among ministers and UK officials.How can\u0026nbspArticle 50 be extended?An extension of Article 50 would require two things: firstly, the UK would have to ask for one. Secondly, the other 27 EU countries would have to unanimously agree to it.There is no formal limit on the deadline extension, though the EU has previously suggested that it would not grant an indefinite prolongation.How is this relevant to a second referendum?Brexiteer MP walks through pro-EU protest with GoPro to document abuseBrexit secretary ‘has not discussed’ delaying UK’s EU withdrawalFury as Brexit secretary suggests no new referendum due to protestsReferendums take quite a bit of time to organise – the Electoral Commission recommends that “referendum legislation should be clear at least six months before it is required to be implemented”, though it could probably in reality be done somewhat quicker than that.Either way, with the clock running down, a second referendum would effectively require an extension (or revocation) of Article 50.Nevertheless, the path to a second referendum depends on the politics of the issue and who supports one.\u0026nbspWould the EU grant an extension?The EU has mostly refused to discuss the hypothetical question of an extension. Some countries, including Ireland, have said they would not stand in the way, but that it is for the UK to ask for one. The UK government has said it does not want one and that its policy is to leave on 29 March.Behind the scenes, EU officials believe a short extension could be possible, but that it should not go beyond May, when the next European parliament elections are due to be called.The UK would, by law, have to participate in these elections unless it had departed the EU beforehand.Officials are wary of the idea of granting an extension for no reason, or just to buy the UK time, if\u0026nbspthere is\u0026nbspno prospect of further process – they believe there should be a reason behind it.Holding a referendum would probably\u0026nbspbe an acceptable reason, though it is impossible to know for sure\u0026nbspwhat will happen until the UK government actually asks the question.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Co-op grew its sales by 3.4 per cent, making it the only chain to expand faster than in 2017.Savvy shoppers increasingly chased the best deals, taking advantage of voucher codes and visiting a range of supermarkets to lower their food spend at Christmas, research from Nielsen found.Sales growth overall more than halved from to 1.8 per cent in the last four weeks of 2018, from 3.7 per cent a year earlier. Online sales were up 9 per cent and now account for 7.5 per cent of the nation’s spend on groceries.Mike Watkins, Nielsen’s UK head of retailer insight, said shoppers are now favouring multiple trips over one big shop, spreading the cost across multiple retailers.“Moreover, with over half of consumers not confident about their finances, shoppers are more budget-conscious and the various promotions and price cuts are a response to help them manage their household budget.”Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said lower inflation had reduced total grocery spend.“This slower inflation rate helped shoppers to manage their festive budgets, with 60 per cent\u0026nbspof customers looking to make savvier decisions to make their money go further over the holidays.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Much more can and must be done to protect and assist children.”Children living in countries at war have come under direct attack, have been used as human shields, killed, maimed or recruited to fight. Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families.

There is nothing cosier than the cocoon of Christmas. And leaving it is a wrench.So a lot of people will be full of dread at the prospect of going back to work.But I actually think that January can be one of the most productive, exciting and dynamic months.And just in case you don’t agree, I’m going to share my tips on how to make January into Fanuary.The first step is to focus on what you want out of this new year. Becauseyou don’t make a plan you will end up exactly where you started, but this time in .If you hate your job, don’t just keep saying that: Work out why you hate it and what steps you need to take to change it. Brush up on your skills. Look for learning opportunities wherever you can — and take them.Be active and invest time in yourself. Dare to dream a bit by applying for jobs you like the look of, evenyou think they are out of your league.Andyou need a helping hand, sign up to my masterclass which will help you to write a killer CV — and even get the pay rise you want.It’s also really important to be positive — evenyou don’t always feel it.If you are surrounded by miserable, negative people you will end up that way too, so go out of your way to mix with positive, enthusiastic types.It’s very easy to stay in your comfort zone but you’ll never know what you are capable of achieving unless you try. Be brave and start taking risks.Another scenario is that you might not hate your job, but wish you felt more challenged, appreciated or engaged.If that’s the case, write a list of things you would doyou were fearless. Then act asyou were. Take small steps: Speak up in a meeting or put yourself forward for something you’ve never done before.And evenyou fail, be proud that you’ve tried.It’s also important to trust yourself — that’s the first step to improving your self image.If you lack self-confidence you won’t achieve much.You might be thinking, “It’s easy for you to say that — you’re successful”.But after my A-levels I never went to uni, and had no other qualications.I had to work really hard and be super-resilient because I could only ever rely on myself.On the way to success you’ll inevitably experience setbacks — but it’s how you respond to them that determines what happens next. Trust that you can handle them.One of the core communication skills is to be assertive, so try to have faith in your opinions. Sure, respect other people’s views but respect your own too.If you’re hoping for a pay rise or promotion in , I firmly believe thatyou don’t ask you don’t get.If the answer is no the first time round, find out what needs to change and work on that so that next time the answer is a yes.Personally, I never hear the word “No”.I hear: “Find another way to get what you want.”Most importantly, never stop encouraging yourself — and find a network to plug into.To network, you have to be ­interested and interesting. First impressions are made in the first seven seconds so, when you meet someone, make eye contact, smile, be polite — and dress the part.Put your phone away and work out an articulate way to explain who you are in  seconds. Be enthusiastic and be your own best friend.Feeling better about January now  I hope so.If you really want to Get What You Want — sign up to my new Masterclass and make this year all about you.IT’S not really a newsflash that British children are addicted to sugar. But the problem is worse than we might have thought.New research shows that from the age of two, children are consuming an average of almost oz of sugar a day, which is more than twice the recommended maximum daily allowance.This is not just destroying our young people’s teeth. Britain now has the worst obesity rate in Western Europe.Being overweight increases the risk of major health problems including Type  diabetes.So this is an unprecedented health crisis waiting to happen.And the reality is it’s not the fault of the Government, the NHS or the schools – it’s down to parents.It’s our responsibility to read food labels and cook healthy meals from scratch rather than relying on ready meals and takeaways.We also need to teach our kids to make good choices themselves and to develop a taste for healthy food.Unfortunately, though, the hardest word in the English language is “No”.Saying: “No, you can’t have sweets, crisps, fizzy drinks or sugary cereal” can be hard.And, often, it’s so much easier to say yes. Sure, you certainly get an easier le, but you’ll also have an obese, unhealthy and unhappy child.Obesity is now a disease. And it’s almost always a self- inflicted one, which takes years off our lives.The good news is that it’s reversible.Perhaps eating less sugar is one new year’s resolution we should all aspire to keep ANYONE  joining me by doing a Dry January this year I’m becoming a bit of a pro since I seem to do it every year.And while I wish I had some uplting advice about how to get through it, the reality is that I am prepared for a depressing, miserable boring month.The only way to survive it is to not go out, not have friends over, do absolutely zilch and just keep on sipping water.I suppose that’s the whole point, in a way.So welcome to the wagon – but roll on February.HUGE congratulations to Abbey Clancy and Peter Crouch on the announcement that they are expecting their fourth child.And also . . . isn’t Abbey looking fabulous in her Instagram snap Most of us, me included, looked like a bag of spuds after two children. But she has three kids already and another on the way and still looks incredible.I guess that’s a combination of good genes, good diet and the right exercise. But whatever she is doing, it’s working. Good for her!SOMETHING tells me that Justin Bieber might regret his new tattoo.He’s had the word “Grace” inked above his eyebrow, which is a lovely sentiment, but at first glance I’m sorry to say it looks a bit like he’s had stitches.And that’s not going to be a great image when he is .I’ve never understood tattoos – let alone on the face – and especially when the result looks like you’ve had a am trip to AE.I’M so happy to hear that every child is going to learn basic first aid including CPR in school to help boost heart attack survival rates.Education Secretary Damian Hinds has announced that he wants all pupils to be able to give emergency care by the time they leave school so more lives can be saved.All I can say is: About time.I did an advanced first aid course and now offer them to all my employees at West Ham. In fact, I actively encourage them to do it.You never know when you might use it, andsomeone does need it you could save their le. Now all schools need to do is bring back home economics lessons so kids can cook for themselves.Then they’ll have some real le skills when they finally leave home.“COULD do better”. That’s the phrase that went through my mind watching Khloe Kardashian twerking on New Year’s Eve for her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson . . . who was completely oblivious.A video showed Khloe shaking her bits and bobs in a silver and black leopard-print bodysuit for Tristan’s benefit – only to look round for a kiss and see that his back was turned.She is a beautul girl and, frankly, she doesn’t have to try so hard.Khloe could be with someone who is genuinely interested in her as opposed to flogging this dead horse. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will it be a General Election, a second referendum, the Government’s deal or a “no deal” exit My guess is that the last two are the most likely.Theresa May’s tactic is to run down the clock until MPs feel they have no option but to back the Government’s deal and avoid a no-deal departure.The Government has been blitzing constituencies to put pressure on MPs via their supporters.But a recent poll indicated that  per cent of Conservative constituency workers think a no-deal Brexit would be better than the PM’s deal.So that tactic hasn’t worked, and a nasty Commons confrontation looms.It is not surprising that David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, has suggested the PM should postpone the vote for a second time.It is the Irish backstop, that tortuous measure which binds Northern Ireland closely to EU regulations, which has caused the most dficulty, particularly as the Government is dependent on DUP votes for its survival.To the DUP it is unacceptable that there should, in effect, be a border down the Irish Sea. To Conservative MPs there is also the danger of being locked into the backstop indefinitely and that, having already agreed to accept £billion, the EU would have no incentive to move on and negotiate a decent Free Trade agreement.If the PM could somehow get firm assurances from the EU that would guarantee the backstop was definitely a temporary measure then that might persuade MPs, including the DUP, to change their minds.After all,the backstop is only temporary, all the things that are objectionable in the backstop, such as the inability to sign new trade deals, are also only temporary.It is not impossible that there could be a concession on these lines. Butthe Government is defeated in the Commons, what then In some ways the PM’s hand might be strengthened and she could say to Brussels that it is absolutely clear the present deal cannot get through ­Parliament.The EU will maintain that its offer is final, but this would not be the first time the EU has said that, only for a new offer to then appear.Opponents of Brexit cling to the hope that defeat in the Commons will lead either to a second referendum or a General Election. But neither will happen automatically.Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, a General Election can only be heldParliament votes for one or the Government loses a vote of ­confidence.The DUP don’t want Jeremy Corbyn as PM and as long as Mrs May’s deal has not passed, the DUP will continue to support the Government.A second referendum could only happenthe Government introduced legislation for one. No Conservative PM would survive doing that.The remaining option is the so- called no-deal Brexit, which really means trading on World Trade ­Organisation terms with both the EU and the rest of the world.This is how much of world trade is conducted and how many countries outside the EU trade with the EU.Strictly speaking there is no such thing as a no-deal Brexit.There would be many side deals covering administrative areas that are not strictly trade, such as health regulations, safety, aviation, transportion of animals and so on.No one is claiming there would be no problems. Inevitably there will be some, but they would essentially be short term, and we would not face a bill of £billion.Leaving without a deal is feared by some large businesses anxious that integrated manufacturing supply chains might be interrupted. But Britain imports manufacturing components already from many non-EU areas of the world. These issues are solvable.Roberto Azevedo, Director General of the World Trade Organisation, has said there is no reason why trading on WTO terms should lead to disruption.He presumably knows what he is talking about.But the Government seems unable to make up its mind about a no-deal Brexit.Originally the PM boldly declared: “No deal is better than a bad deal”. Presumably she meant it.But recently the Government has launched Project Fear Mark , highlighting the alleged disaster of a no-deal Brexit in a lurid way.This campaign provoked a civil servant to write a remarkable anonymous article in a national ­newspaper declaring that “the civil ­service was ready for no-deal”, advanced preparations had been made and she accused the Government of deliberately concealing the work that had been done in order to pressurise MPs to swallow the ­Government’s “disastrous deal”.It seems probable that the Government will not be able to get the PM’s deal through Parliament and so will have to go back to Brussels, not just once, but maybe several times.If the EU refuses to budge, the automatic legal position is that the UK will leave on March , eventhere is no deal and stalemate in Parliament.There is very little that Parliament can do to stop that now. It is what Parliament has voted for in the past.My guess is that the EU may well come up with some concession, perhaps a legally binding clarication, and that there will be a lot of arguing, probably right up to midnight on March .But whatever happens, the next day we will leave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thanks to this Prime Minister, we haven’t a clue how  will start, let alone finish.Chaos is the only certainty as the Government faces parliamentary defeat over her Chequers botch.We might then be in for a grinding marathon of rematches, a crisis General Election, a second referendum or — the only really positive option — joining hands with the rest of the world.Thanks to Brexit saboteur Phil Hammond, the path to those open seas is blocked by tank traps, landmines and treasury barbed wire.Hammond, aided by EU fth columnist Olly Robbins, is the panic merchant behind Project Fear Mark .Unless we accept Brexit In Name Only , abide by EU rules on trade and customs and bow to the European Court of Justice, we will starve to deathwe are not first eaten alive by rats. These are only “worst case” scenarios, you understand.More likely, we would prosper and flourish without a deal and, after a brief period of turbulence, wonder what this bitterness and recrimination was all about.Hammond, who loathes Mrs May and would have been sacked in a flash had she won her catastrophic  election, is now lead blues singer with The Remoaners.When the history of this bungled mess is written, he will emerge as principal villain, the Scrooge Chancellor who blocked every attempt to win a real deal from Brussels.He has waited until too late to unleash a few quid to build ferry and port infrastructure.His motive, shared by the hostage PM, is to drive home the fraudulent nightmares of No Deal at the expense of the national interest.Olly Robbins, a fan of Stalin’s Soviet Union, is the so-called Brexit negotiator who failed at any point in the last two miserable years to wring a single unwilling concession out of Brussels.History’s verdict will be harsher stillwe now end up bogged down indefinitely with BRINO, locked into EU coils without any of the benefits of actually getting out.Brussels doesn’t want us to leave — and they will make damned sure we don’t.The catalyst will be the day Mrs May actually signs off £BILLION to keep the leaky EU afloat while Britain remains shackled to a sinking ship.So far, this vast sum is merely a digital symbol with no immediate impact on the hard-pressed taxpayers who must pay.But once this cheque is cashed, reality will dawn with unpredictable consequences.For there is no magic £billion sitting in Treasury vaults. We would have to borrow it to bail out the EU — while struggling to pay our own bills here at home.Britain has little appetite for social unrest. For the moment, we can look across the Channel with bemused detachment as Paris is engulfed in flames.But .million people here voted for Brexit. They knew what they were doing.The same is not quite true of those who voted to stay.Many were reluctant Remainers. Some would have voted for Brexit, but for George Osborne’s original Shock and Horror. They know better now.They have seen ministers crying “wolf” too often.They don’t believe Theresa May, Hammond, the Treasury or discredited George “Six Jobs” Osborne.No Deal terries Brussels but it doesn’t scare waverers any more.Along with Tory MPs ing fortied by local supporters after the Christmas break, most are braced and ready for leaving the EU on global trade terms.Mrs May is banking everything on a last-ditch deal with Brussels over the Northern Ireland scam.Without it, she — or someone  — must tear up the cheque, hoist the sails and steer Britain out of the EU and into clear blue water.ENERGETIC Health Secretary Matt Hancock wants to make the patchy NHS world class.Here’s one good reason why he must.A friend with a skin blemish was booked for a biopsy in Chelmsford, Essex, last March.Months rolled by.So she paid out of her savings for a biopsy and then surgery after a specialist confirmed cancer and warned delay might have serious consequences.This weekend, NINE months later, she received a letter of apology and an update on her place in the queue for the biopsy.How many patients die before they get a letter like that Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The trial will start in July this year.After the trial is over, Ms Rudd will look at how it worked and consider best how to put everyone onto the new new flagship welfare policy.MPs need to vote to approve both the trial, and also on how to put the million others onto the new system.That meansyoure currently on benefits youre unlikely to move over to the new system this year.But Theresa May has said the programme is still on track to be done by  - with everyone on it.The news comes just after The Sun launched its Make Universal Credit Work campaign, demanding ministers make more changes to the flagship policy now before its too late.Weve told countless stories of how Brits are being pushed into debt waiting for their first payment, and have been forced to food banks and to payday loans.Ms Rudd revealed also revealed that the number of people who will be on Universal Credit will DOUBLE by the end of the year - as people naturally move over.This means thatyou have a change of circumstance - likeyou move home, your partner moves in with you, or you lose your job and have to make a new claim for benefits, then you will go onto Universal Credit.Ministers expect there to be another .million people who go onto Universal Credit in that way this year.And they wont be able to get any help with payments when they change over either, leaving many hundreds of pounds worse off.No, its just the process for people already on benefits which is being considered at the moment.Universal Credit rolls six benefits into one monthly payment, but the rollout has been beset with issues.Its now in every jobcentre in the country and is unlikely to be ditched altogether.MPs are worried about thousands of vulnerable and disabled Brits who could slip through the net and lose their benefits in the transfer.Others are urging the Government to transfer them over automatically, rather than make them sign up all over again.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told the Commons, said: I will want to consider carefully when I bring to the House the vote for the three million managed migration, which is scheduled for . Im still considering when to do that.She added: The , pilot as always, which was announced some time ago, informs us how we do that.Yes. In the last Budget Philip Hammond promised to increase the work allowances for people on Universal Credit by £, - allowing millions to earn £ extra every year from April this year.He also revealed:Theres lots of help out there for people who are already on Universal Credit and wont be seeing any changes anytime soon.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She and Harry love walking the dogs there, and they can entertain their friends in complete solitude.”The farmhouse, which dates from the th century, has four bedrooms with one converted to a dressing room.An attached converted barn includes an “upper kitchen” and “lower kitchen” plus a sitting area with floor-to-ceiling windows.There is a large dining room plus an outdoor seating area with patio heaters.And the house comes with a two-bedroom cottage for guests or staff.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex started renting the property early last year on a two-year lease and moved in before their May wedding.Harry, , and Meghan, , will keep it for the time being even when they move from Kensington Palace to Windsor’s Frogmore Cottage — a switch revealed by The Sun last year.Meghan is currently overseeing renovation work on the Windsor home and they hope to move in before the birth of their first baby, believed to be due in late March or early April.The picture shows the farmhouse after renovation work was completed in  and was published on a freely-accessible and public document.Kensington Palace declined to comment tonight. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And as this carries on day in, day out, we see no nightmare queues of lorries backed up at our ports.In fact, there is no friction at all at the borders even though much of the “just in time” delivery we depend on comes from outside the European Union.We are not told the Civil Service is ready and prepared to handle a No Deal Brexit. This plan is being withheld from MPs and the British people in order to push Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement, which could bind us to EU control indefinitely.Make no mistake, Her Majesty’s Revenue  Customs are ready for a No Deal Brexit. All computer systems will be ready by January  and businesses have been advised about “Trusted Trader Schemes” to keep trade flowing.The EU has announced plans for visa-free travel and aviation rights.The French have installed high-tech scanners at Calais to keep both trade and tourism flowing.Friendly “Open Skies” agreements have been signed with our most important partners outside the EU — the US and Canada. We have agreed transitional trade agreements with Switzerland.There is so much to be optimistic about.As for our trade with the EU, that will not stop evenextra tarfs are slapped on our exports.The EU has a trade surplus of £billion with the UK.In , European countries sold £billion-worth of goods to us — that’s a lot of cars, food and wine they want to go on selling us.It is strongly in Europe’s interests to cut a deal.There are so many advantages of a No Deal Brexit. Number one, we keep our £billion — the cost of Theresa May’s deal. That is taxpayers’ money that can be used to boost British businesses.We will be free to enter into new trade deals. We are the fth largest economy in the world. The suggestion that we are too small to cut trade deals is nonsense.Australia, a much smaller economy than ours, negotiated deals with China, South Korea and Japan in just  months.Iceland has an agreement with China and its economy is tiny compared to ours. We would be free to run our economy as we wish, slashing red tape and burdensome regulation.Our friendships across the world with Commonwealth and other English-speaking countries can be re-energised. We have nothing to fear.The risks of staying in the EU, by contrast, are great.The EU has not been an economic success. Its love affair with bureaucracy and heavy taxation hold it back.Its growth rates since the financial crisis have been much lower than ours. Levels of unemployment are so high in some EU countries, no wonder young people there come to the UK where, at four per cent, we have the lowest level of unemployment for  years.As a hotelier, I can say without exception, it is much more dficult to do business in Europe than it is in the UK.The EU’s high corporate taxes, complex labour laws and tricky legal system make Britain’s low taxes and fair laws very appealing.There are so many reasons to be cheerful about our future outside the European Union.But Remainers are not able to provide any positive arguments for staying in.That is why they scaremonger with Project Fear.

Right ahead.”Then we all sat and waited for the impact that would surely follow.And waited . . . and waited, as Gemma remained stubbornly upright for the duration.Such is le at Dancing On Ice, “the show where anything could happen”, according to the continuity announcer, but never actually does.That’s the main reason why people stopped watching and ITV buried it in a cold and shallow grave five years ago.Then, without much warning or any great demand, it was suddenly brought back to le, last year, and proved every bit as underwhelming and injury free as I remembered.There’s no horse too dead for another ITV flogging, though, so it’s just ed for yet another run, with most of the same fixtures and fittings.Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby do a solid enough job of hosting, considering their script could suck a black hole inside out, and there’s a four- man Ice Panel where the truth bombs are exclusively supplied by Jason Gardiner, who arrived dressed as Bret Maverick for Sunday’s opening show.What seems to separate this year’s Dancing On Ice from almost every other series, however, is the line-up. It’s actually quite imaginative and offers the show a serious chance of redemption,just one of them can be hospitalised before the end of the run.Among the  contenders, we’ve got: Westle’s Brian McFadden, Richard “Hollywood is the catalyst for everything I do” Blackwood, cricketer Ryan Sidebottom, and Saira Khan, who was advised by Ruth Langsford to “do Strictly”, but is a bit too low rent for the BBC so is stuck here wearing skates and tights.Despite having two hours to fill, none of that lot actually got to dance on Sun- day, though, as, I suspect, ITV wanted to clear the decks for its preferred bookings.These include -year-old Didi Conn , from Grease, Corrie’s Jane Danson, who was put in “a horse lt, with half rotation”, and Mark “Joe Mangel” Little, who’s turned into Dog The Bounty Hunter since we last saw him on Neighbours.But let’s not kid ourselves here. The reason many of us probably tuned in, on Sunday, in was to see Gemma Collins.Towie’s self-styled “GC” the first letter of which stands for Gigantic. A woman who really could do with a heavy landing on that over-entitled a**e of hers or, better still, developing a work ethic and some humility.I prayed for the worst then, and saved what was left for her partner, Matt Evers, but he’d clearly taken one look at Gemma and thought “screw that for le without a disability allowance”.There were no lts, no falls and she didn’t even have the decency to rip her drawers when she tried the splits. Sunday was just another entry in DOI’s endless list of crushing disappointments.Partly thanks to some very sympathetic marking, from everyone except Jason, Gemma will also get to skate again in a fortnight, which, I think I’m right in saying, means they’ll have to make an attempt at the infamous “King Kong lt”.And then, once Addison Lee has dropped her off at the rink, it’s on with the skating.Piers Morgan: “I bumped into Gemma Collins in Langan’s restaurant, at Christmas, and . . . ”A “She’s OK, actually.”B “A Japanese sports network bought the footage for million yen.”THE expression TV gold doesn’t begin to do justice to BBC’s fly-on-the-wall documentary about Matt and Luke Goss’s O reunion gig.It’s a genuine masterpiece that would deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Spinal Tap,the pair of them weren’t so wonderfully serious about everything.Bros: After The Screaming Stops is the title of the film, directed by David Soutar and Joe Pearlman, who had the good sense just to point their cameras at the boys and let them say things like: “I made a conscious decision, because of Stevie Wonder, not to be superstitious.” “Rome wasn’t built in a day, f*** me that’s true, but we don’t have the time Rome did.” “He was a rectangle, I was a rectangle and together we made a square, which is a fortress.” And “There were  one-way streets and one solitary two-way street, where me and my brother met in the middle.” .As well as all the tortured metaphors and Matt’s profundities, though, the film also features a fantastically earnest rant about conkers and an escalating feud between the boys, which should have had every single viewer crying out for both of them to be included in the next I’m A Celebrity line-up, pretty much from the word go.But how did I feel at the end of this emotional dual carriageway In the words of poet philosopher singer Matt Goss: “Two words. Privileged.”John Humphrys: “At least  of the  books of the New Testament are usually attributed to which author ”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “New Year’s Day in the UK, January or December ”Lauren: “December.”And Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In , Mark Calaway, who’s better known as The Undertaker, retired from which sport ”Gerry: “Golf.”The Voice UK fooling me into thinking it might go a whole episode without Jenner Hudson “spontaneously” bursting into song.Luther turning out to be a soulless, unpleasant, far-fetched mess. The insane pouting contortions of Candice “Bake Off” Brown during Celebrity Mastermind.The BBC somehow crowbarring an anti-Brexit dig into The Greatest Dancer.And Dee Dee Wilde calling her old Tena Lady troop, on the same show, Pan’s Fans, rather than the far more appropriate and eye-catching Pads People. Basic stuff, really.Steve Howey: “You need to have experienced that experience to have the experience.”And Phil Thompson: “All these City players are like for like. Even Danilo, who isn’t as good as Kyle Walker.”JUST when they thought we couldn’t send them anything worse than the potato famine, up pipes Last Leg Of The Year guest Sue Perkins with this Brexit bonus: “My New Year’s resolution is to try and track down a dim and distant Irish relative, so I can finally get that passport.”Andthere are any genealogists who can help, send the information to me marked “Generation Game: Urgent.”Knighthood’s in the post.Paul Ryan’s Farage cameo on Brexit: The Uncivil War.Clarkson not trying to be likeable, on Millionaire, which, ironically, made him very likeable.Bradley Walsh hating every second of his skye on ITV’s Breaking Dad.Simplicity Cremations’ perfectly-placed advert during The Last Leg Of The Year .And Billy Connolly, overwhelmed by love, on BBC, paying tribute to: “All the things that made me good and bad, Scotland.”Match Of The Day’s Jonathan Pearce on Alo Morata: “He needs to do that game in, game out to prove he’s good enough for Cha.”“They need to do that gay men, gay marriage to prove he’s good enough for Cha.”Sent in by Iain Milne, Newcastle.

Jean-Marc Puissesseau savaged the Transport Secretary for spending poundmillion on ferries to prepare for no deal Brexit - including on a firm that doesnt yet own any ferries. Seaborne Freight was handed a contract worth almost poundmillion to set up a route from Ramsgate, Kent, to Ostend in Belgium to boost capacitythere is no deal. Meanwhile the M motorway and disused Manston airfield are being lined up as lorry parksextra checks spark delays at the Port of Dover. But despite previously warning of -mile tailbacks, port President Mr Puissesseau claimed his port was perfectly able to handle the freight and implied the no deal spending was insulting.  We have been preparing for no deal for one year in Calais and on  March we will be ready, he claimed. And he angrily hit out at the government for allegedly trying to take business from his port by setting up a new service to Ostend in Belgium. He told the BBC Calais will not impose extra delays, other than the migrant checks running now. His officials will only ask for customs declarations, he claimed. We will not stop and ask more than we are doing today, he told BBC Radio s Today. I am very shocked.  I consider it disrespectful to Calais and to Dover what has been decided by the Mr Grayling of the British government. Mr Puissesseau made his bold claim of no delays despite research for the government warning it would take just  seconds of checks per truck to cause six-day tailbacks in Kent. He said the money was helping three ferry companies, among them one company which has no ferry, which is not working today, helping from Ostend to Ramsgate. It is a complete shock for us.  He claimed the only positive point is the migrants will leave Calais I hope to go to Oostend. The row illustrates the delicate negotiations over Brexit between the UK, EU and private firms. The UK government has insisted it is sensible to prepare for every eventuality, including ferry capacity. A Department for Transport spokesman said of Seaborne: This contract was awarded in the full knowledge that Seaborne Freight is a new shipping provider, and that the extra capacity and vessels would be provided as part of its first services. As with all contracts, we carefully vetted the companys commercial, technical and financial position in detail before making the award.

Barry Gardiner and Andrew Gwynne both made the announcements as the Prime Ministers agreement looked doomed to defeat in the House of Commons on Tuesday. So far Labour, including figures around Jeremy Corbyn, have refused to say exactly when they would table a formal no confidence vote in the government. They insist its a matter of when not , without giving a date. But Shadow Trade Secretary Mr Gardiner told BBC Radio s Today programme: Obviously, the next thing to do immediately after that [a defeat] is for there to be a vote of confidence in the Government. He added the appropriate time to table such a motion is when the Government loses its key legislation and no longer commands a majority in the House of Commons. He was backed by Shadow Communities Secretary Andrew Gwynne, who told Sky News: Weve got a very clear position. If this deal does not pass through the House of Commons we will be calling for an immediate general election. The only way you can secure a general election is to table a motion of confidence in the government.  Mr Gwynne saidMrs Mays deal does not pass it is a spectacular failure for the government. We want a general election. And the only way you can get a general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act is to table a vote of confidence, he said. He reiterated: In the event of Theresa May failing to get her deal through, we will be calling for a general election. And to do that, you have to table a motion of confidence. Askedit was a guarantee, Mr Gwynne replied: Absolutely. Responding to both politicians comments, a Labour spokeswoman insisted the partys policy was still to judge the timing day by day. She said: If the government is defeated next week, it will clearly have lost the confidence of parliament and there should be a general election.We have always said that it’s a matter of when, notwe table a motion of no confidence and we’ll judge the timing day by day.   Labour failed in a bid to have a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister before Christmas. But that vote was only in Theresa May personally - not Her Majestys Government. If Labour lays a full no confidence vote, it will have to be debated the next day. If the government loses, and no one  can command a Commons majority, a general election is triggered automatically after  days. But there is a big flaw in proposing a no confidence vote. The Tories  DUP allies have said they will only back Labour against the governmentthe Brexit deal PASSES, notit fails. It came as Theresa Mays Brexit deal looked doomed to defeat next Tuesday after her DUP allies REJECTED a compromise - before she even published it.  Mrs Mays deputy David Lidington said the government would unveil specic proposals to calm fears in Northern Ireland about her -page Brexit deal. But minutes later and before he even published the plan the DUP rejected those compromises in a dramatic TV interview. The row is over a backstop that could trap the UK under EU customs rules, and force checks on trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK,there is no agreement to safeguard the Irish border by December . EU chiefs have agreed to provide extra assurances but not remove the backstop.  Yet DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told Sky News: The only deal that could swing the DUP round isthe backstop as it applies to the UK as a whole or to Northern Ireland specically were removed from this agreement. He added: Constitutionally and economicallythis deal went through it would be ruinous and indeed would do what th IRA failed to do over  years of a terrorist campaign. Meanwhile today, Tory rebel Dominic Grieve tabled an amendment that would give MPs a greater say over what happens nextthe deal is voted down. It would require a motion to be put to the Commons by Monday  January, not mid-February.

Senior Tory Oliver Letwin, formerly staunchly loyal, said: “I want to make it abundantly clear that a majority in this House will not allow a no-deal exit to occur at the end of March.” Ultimately, the MPs could succeed in amending all legislation, but it was not clear what alternative plan would get majority support.Many MPs have grave concerns over other options including a second referendum and the defaultno plan B is agreed is for the UK to leave without a deal.The defeat was particularly humiliating for Mrs May as it was the first time in more than  years that a government has lost a vote on a finance bill.  But they did not rule out hauling MPs in at weekends and over the February half term to get legislation through.A senior cabinet minister told the Mirror the Prime Minister feels it is her responsibility to deliver the UK’s departure from the EU “come what may”. It came as Mrs May acknowledged for the first time that she could lose next Tuesday’s crunch vote. She told her cabinet she would “move quickly” in the event of her deal falling. Ministers suggested she would put it before the Commons again within days. But the PM failed to set out her plans beyond that - although sources said she again ruled out other options, including a second referendum and delaying Brexit. It laid bare the bitter ide at the top of Government with Brexiteer ministers believing no deal would be better than a bad one - and others fiercely against crashing out.   Several think Mrs May could fall back to a no deal Brexit in the event of a humiliating defeat in further votes. “There was a real sense in the room that we’re boxed in. Every option was raised and then roundly quashed,” one told the Mirror. “The PM really believes it’s her responsibility to take us out of the EU come what may.” However, Mrs May has previously said a no deal Brexit could be catastrophic for the economy. If she backed crashing out she would face dozens of ministerial resignations, including from her cabinet. Justice Secretary David Gauke has already said he would walk. More than  Tory MPs have publicly indicated they would try to stop it. Welfare secretary Amber Rudd warned colleagues: “History will take a dim view of a Cabinet that presses ahead with no deal.” She appealled to them to “find the centre” and work with Labour MPs to get a majority for an alternative Brexit agreement. In a further sign of defiance, business secretary Greg Clark told MPs that no deal should “not be contemplated” because it would cripple British firms that trade with the EU. In bizarre scenes, the PM’s top ministers mocked hardline Brexiteers who believe they can get a better dealthey vote down her plan. Environment Secretary Michael Gove triggered laughter as he compared Brexiteers to “mid-s swingers waiting for Scarlett Johansson to turn up”. Ms Rudd quipped: “Pierce Brosnan as well.” Earlier, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay insisted the UK will leave the EU on  March despite cliams it could extend article . UK officials are said to be “putting out feelers” and “testing the waters” on the idea of delaying the date of exit to buy more time to find a deal. The Mirror understands that Commons leader Ms Leadsom would rather be sacked than oversee the legislation needed to postpone the UK’s departure. MPs kicked off their ‘guerilla’ war in Parliament inflicting a defeat on the Government by blocking taxation powers unless a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table.  Mrs May met last night with some of a cross-party group of more than  backbenchers who have signed a letter calling on her to rule out a no deal. One Labour MP present said: “She was mostly Maybot, it was a very wobbly performance. She’s not convincing anyone.” The PM is pinning her hopes on EU chiefs granting yet more concessions on Brexit before next week’s vote. She was offered a glimmer of hope when Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the EU was willing to give written assurances about the withdrawal agreement. But most of the PM’s own cabinet privately believe she faces a humiliating defeat. The Government last night confirmed MPs would be asked to vote on exactly the same deal as the one she postponed before Christmas. Jeremy Corbyn said: “The Government has admitted that nothing has changed. Theresa May has run down the clock and secured no legal or other changes to the withdrawal agreement. The delay has achieved nothing beyond wasting a month.” The Labour leader came under mounting pressure last night to back a second referendum, ahead of Labour’s policy-making body meeting today to thrash out how to take forward plans agreed at conference in September. Some , Labour members and supporters have contacted the national policy forum demanding another Brexit vote. MP Conor McGinn said: “It is clear from the strength of feeling of our members that we must have a serious discussion about how Labour moves forward towards supporting a ‘people’s vote’ when Theresa May’s deal is rejected in Parliament.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate bush reveals not tory","story":"NewsKate Bush reveals she is NOT a Tory - two years after praising Theresa MayThe Wuthering Heights legend said she wants to \"make clear\" she is not a Tory supporter after the claim became \"pervasive\"ShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political EditorKeiran Southern:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe Wuthering Heights singer moved to clary comments she made more than two years ago \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailKate Bush has DENIED being a Tory in a rare public statement on her political views.

I was very disappointed that the use of a quote out of context was timed with the release of the live album and it seemed asthe focus went onto the quote rather than the work. It was deeply frustrating. At the time I discussed the idea of responding to it with close friends and we all agreed it was best to let it go. It seems the quote keeps being used and so I’d like to present my side of the story.  Over the years, I have avoided making political comments in interviews. My response to the interviewer was not meant to be political but rather was in the defence of women in power. I felt he was putting a really negative slant on powerful women, referring to a witch hunt involving Hilary Clinton. In response I said that we had a woman in charge of our country, and that I felt it was a good thing to have women in power. I should have been clearer when I then said it was the best thing that had happened to us for a long time - because I greatly disliked the behaviour of the previous PM, who at that point I felt had abandoned us and everybody felt angry and let down.

He told the BBC that sad cowards with nothing better to do had issued the threat after he joined forces with Labour to inflict another humiliating defeat on the PM last night. He vowed not to be bowed by the attacks. Mr Boles, who voted Remain in the referendum, has been pushing for the UK to have a similar relationship to Norway with the EU. Its latest iteration - called Norway plus - would mean leaving the EU, but staying in the single market and the customs union.  On Tuesday night the Lincolnshire MP became one of  Tories to vote for an amendment to block taxation powers unless no-deal is taken off the table. They dealt a blow to the government after the amendment passed by  votes to .Labour former minister Yvette Cooper tabled an amendment to the Budget-enactingFinance Bill which attracted support from Tory rebels.Her proposal aims to restrict the Governments freedom to use the Bill to make tax changes linked to a no-deal Brexit without the explicit consent of Parliament. In his speech Mr Boles said Theresa May had secured a deal that Tory MPs could support.   He said: We do not have a bad deal we may have a deal that you, inidually, do not like, but nobody can claim that we do not have a deal that it is reasonable for Conservative members to support. It is therefore reasonable for us to say that, at this late stage, with the government having prepared as woefully as they have for no deal, we will on no account countenance a no-deal Brexit. He concluded: I will vote on any motion, on any amendment, on any piece of legislation, proposed by whomsoever in this House to ensure that we leave the European Union on  March with a deal or not at all. But Downing Street has downplayed the signicance of these limits. Mr Boles is one of the latest in a long line of MPs to receive abuse because of their stance on Brexit. On Monday footage of Tory Remainer Anna Soubry being called a Nazi by far right protesters caused outrage throughout Westminster. A clip which showed the MP for Broxtowe being followed and shouted at prompted a number of MPs to write to the Met Police Commissioner to ask officers to step in. It followed a day of yellow vest protesters following MPs and journalists around Westminster, some of whom yelled abuse.

Notices warning belongings will be seized have been erected in a Tube subway, a few feet from where two rough sleepers were found dead or dying in the last year. The signs say: These walkways are cleaned on a daily basis. Private property must not be left unattended within the walkways. Any property or possessions that appear to be left unattended for any period of time and for whatever reason may be removed without any further notice and may be disposed of as litter or waste. They have been placed directly opposite chalk tributes that still adorn the wall to Gyula Remes, a kitchen worker who was found dying in the subway last month.  Westminster Council claimed the signs were not directed at anyone specically. But Labours Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey said: These signs smack of the Council trying to push homelessness problems out of sight, out of mind. In cold winter weather, blankets and sleeping bags may be people’s leline not ‘litter’ or ‘waste’. But ultimately rising homelessness is a national problem which needs national action from Government.  Usually there are up to half a dozen people sleeping rough in the affected portion of the subway early in the morning, but today there were none. Metal crowd control barriers have also been put up in the subway, which leads directly to the door MPs and staff use to access the Houses of Parliament. In a separate action, part of the subway has also been closed off for building work.  House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom - who does not have responsibility for the subway - is in talks with Commons authorities to try and address the issue. She said: Homelessness and iniduals sleeping rough in and around Westminster station continues to be a sad and serious issue and one which I am keen to see addressed. I am in discussions with the Director General and will be looking to see what more can be done to ensure the safety and security of those sleeping rough near the estate - and how we can help them off the streets and into accommodation. A Westminster City Council spokesperson said: These signs are not directed at anyone specically, but a reminder from the Council and politan Police that given this is a busy public area, any items left unattended will be cleared in the interest of safety and security - especially given the proximity to Parliament and Whitehall. We take the security of our public places very seriously, working closely with the police to keep Londoners and visitors safe.

Flights were also disrupted at Heathrow on Tuesday, after multiple sightings of drones near the runway. Government ministers are hoping to give civilian authorities the power to defend themselves - and the public - from unlawful and malicious drone activity, providing them with military-style defences such as electronic jammers and net guns. The new laws will also see drones and other remote controlled aircrafts completely banned in a three mile radius from all airports - an improvement on the current ban of two-thirds of a mile, according to The Times.  Maximum flight heights for drones currently stand at ft, and that number is set to be lowered by the new legislation set to be drafted in May. Ministers are hoping to one-up hostile drone operators by employing state-of-the-art high-tech safety devices before they hit the market. Such technology could include geo-fences, which would see drones programmed to avoid no-fly zones with the use of GPS co-ordinates or ground transmitters. However, for such measures to be effective, reform of police search powers will also need to take place so officers can ensure any devices comply with new laws.   They may also need to be permitted to bring drones down quickly with shotguns, hunting drones and missiles in circumstances posing threats of disruption or risk to le. Last Week reports revealed that Heathrow and Gatwick are set to spend millions investing in anti-drone technology, including the likes of the ‘Drone Dome’, which can jam communications between the drone pilot and the vessel. The drone threat came of age when they were used in Mosul to deliver bombs. But Gatwick highlighted a dferent threat, which is to create chaos rather than deliver ordnance,” said an official. It is an international problem but we want to become world leaders in solving it. The culprits behind the Gatwick disruption have yet to be identied, after more than , flights were erted, grounded an cancelled during the busy holiday period last month. Police say they have a large list of suspects but admit no arrests are imminent.

The former Truro city councillor still went on holiday to Butlins soon after the win, Cornwall Live reports. His first decision was to do something for the Merlin MS Centre in Cornwall as his late we Rosemary suffered from the condition for  years. He asked the charity what they wanted and the answer was a hot tub the largest hot tub in the country – a high tech anti-gravity pound million hydrotherapy pool for those suffering from MS, strokes, Parkinson’s and ME.   And Peters familys lives have all changed forever.All three of his children – Helen, Sharon and Anthony – now have new mortgage-free houses and brand new cars.His  grandchildren have or will have the same too - as will his three great-grandchildren and the one thats on the way. The lucky -year-old, who still does the lottery every week, said: “I used to go into shops and think it would be nice to have this and that, but now I can have what I want.” That includes a BMW i, an electric BMW i, Porsche Cayman in its own unique colour, a Bentley, and the last three Land Rover Defenders made .   Other purchases have included a pound, watch from Michael Spiers jewellers in Truro, a helicopter trip to the Cheltenham Gold Cup and two static caravans kept at his beloved Butlins in Minehead. But he ensures he keeps himself grounded, saying “I still own the house on Trelanderand would go back in a shot – I loved living there.” It was May , , when Peter Congdon checked his Wednesday Lotto ticket on Teletext as usual.“I’ve got pound,” he thought. “Oh no, it’s not...” Shocked, he walked to his daughter’s house ten doors down from him who double-checked the ticket - and it was certainly a lot more than pound. Peter had won just over pound. million.   The multi-millionaire said: “I couldn’t believe it then and I still can’t really believe it now.” The pool hes funding for the Merlin MS Centre will open in February.It will prove a leline for many and Peter’s kindness has even brought some sufferers to tears, with one man looking forward for his first dip in water for  years. The building will be painted primrose with the flowers planted outside as they were Rosemary’s favourite. Peter and his family have raised thousands for Merlin over the years on top of his poundm donation.   This includes donating a brand new Land Rover as a raffle prize, holding bingo competitions and taking part in a parachute jump. But Peter still gets emails and letters from strangers begging for money three years after his win. Daughter Helen Venton said: “We had funny letters from the beginning – including one man who wanted a coffin for his own funeral. We received the first letter on the actual night of the win – a woman wanted help paying off her husband’s gambling debts.” They have also had requests from strangers askingPeter will pay for weddings. One came all the way from Australia, addressed to Peter Congdon, Lottery Winner, Truro, Cornwall.  But Helen said: “We’ve been on the other end, trying to find money for prom dresses, for example.” That’s why Peter now loans out his flashy cars for school proms, only asking for a donation to the MS Centre in exchange.It’s all about “little gestures”, he says.Those gestures include paying for Tregolls School’s fireworks display for the past three years and funding campaign leaflets for Melissa Mead, the Penryn mum who recently received the MBE for her work raising awareness of sepsis. How much is left of Peter’s cash then  “I’ve got enough for this week,” he said.  He’s made investments and put some of the money in property, owning three houses at Trelander and three at Hendra in Truro. The family say they also fall victim of rumour and gossip. One of Peter’s relatives was shopping for nappies in Tesco when she heard a woman saying: “You’d think she’d find somewhere better to shop.” Peter said: Camelot were great, offering us a financial adviser and which banks we should use. They also respond to the begging letterswe forward them.   Although his home is a lot bigger than his previous abode, Peters house is still a modest affair.The giant cheque with the full amount of pound,, sits next to photos of the announcement at The Alverton hotel as well as the winning balls in lottery champagne glasses. The pensioner said: I told my children, Im thinking of having a tattoo. Dont be silly, they told me. But hed already had it done and revealed his lucky numbers tattooed over his heart alongside a rose in memory of his late we Rosemary who never got to experience the familys riches.

Mark Davies, , set up a tent on a small piece of land in the shadow of Leeds General Infirmary. Everyday he sits out front, crossed legged on a piece of blue tarpaulin, next to his beloved Pit Bull Terrier Luna.A sympathetic businessman let Mark pitch a tent on the land after he was forced out of his council flat by drug addicts around six months ago. Mark told Leeds Live: I had a council flat, but it was not secure and smackheads in the area took everything I had. The last thing I had was Luna and they wanted to take her, but no smackhead is taking my dog. Mark then explained why he wont stay in a homeless hostel such as St Georges Crypt, which is only a few metres away.  They dont let dogs in there, he said matter of factly. Theres one hostel on Meanwood Road, but apparently they have a separate dog kennel block. Luna wouldnt settle at all in a block with other dogs, the sight of another dog sends her crazy. I shouldnt be in a tent, I should be in a flat. Im a council tenant. But its not secure and I dont feel safe there. I feel safer here because there is always someone walking backwards and forwards.I camp here because its always in the public eye,anyone wants to try and steal my dog its going to be witnessed. Ive been attacked in the past when I was homeless, but not this time. I think its because Ive got the dog as a deterrent. Over the last few months, Mark has rarely left his new home because hes worried it will be raided. Mark, who has spent five winters of the streets of his hometown, now has three other rough sleepers with him to watch his back and his belongings. I were lucky me, because I read up on survival before I became homeless, said Mark. I know how to take care of myself and make a fire. Ive even checked the legality . But Im worried about my dog in the cold, more than myself as Im more equipped to deal with it. There are also the undesirables who come along at night. Certain people come here, see the tent and think its some bum hotel and just anyone can go in. Those people always seem to turn up at night. But not all of Marks visitors are looking to steal from him. Many give him food and spare change. In recent weeks he has been given so much food that he couldnt eat it all decided to offer it to other rough sleepers instead of throwing it out. The kindness of strangers has kept Mark and Luna fed and safe for the past few months, but he says hes determined to find a new home and live independently.

The stop-gap property, nestled in four acres of Oxfordshire fields, has already played hosts to a number of star-studded guests - from Amal and George Clooney, to Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian. Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland is also said to have paid a visit to the Grade II-listed home, which is valued at pound. million.   Dating back to the th century, the four bedroom property has been home for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex since May, and they will remain there as they await the completion of Frogmore Cottage ’s renovation - said to conclude early this year. It’s a fabulous place with stunning views and extraordinarily private, a source told The Sun . It’s set in a small bowl of beautul countryside so is not overlooked in any way. Meghan adores the area. She and Harry love walking the dogs there, and they can entertain their friends in complete solitude.”   The property has an converted barn attached to its exterior, which contains two kitchens on each floor, plus a scene sitting area with floor-to-ceiling windows. The grounds also have a two bedroom cottage for guests or staff, as well as an outdoor seating area with a heated patio. Harry, , and Meghan, , moved into the home shortly before their wedding in May last year. The Duchess is currently supervising the refurbishment of their soon-to-be permanent home, Frogmore Cottage, where they hope to be living before the birth of their first baby, due in late March or early April.  Frogmore Cottage has more than enough space for the Sussex family and a nursery for their baby - and even a gym or a yoga studio - with  bedrooms. Formerly known as Double Garden Cottage, the home is set within Windsor Castles Home Park and faces the stunning and sprawling grounds of Frogmore House, which will no doubt become a more popular stop on the Windsor tourist trail. The cottage is currently ided into five units which were home to royal staff, but it will be transformed into a family home with modern amenities. Frogmore Cottage is set in an area that has sentimental value and many memories for the Duke, , and Duchess, .  Its half a mile south of Windsor Castle, the Queens summer residence, and St Georges Chapel, where Harry and Meghan tied the knot in May as millions around the world watched on TV. Their wedding reception, hosted by the Prince of Wales, was held at Frogmore House, which was also where the couples engagement photos were taken. They reportedly had a summer picnic there in  before getting engaged. Frogmore House is in a peaceful and secluded location, surrounded by  acres of lush vegetation and Berkshire countryside. The estate has its own man-made lake, Frogmore Lake, and is home to the Royal Burial Ground and the tomb of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.  Those interred at the burial ground include King Edward VIII and his we Wallis Simpson - the orced American socialite whose intended marriage to Edward sparked a constitutional crisis and led to his abdication in . Meghan is the second American orcee to marry into the Royal Family, but unlike Wallis she has been warmly received. Frogmore House was once home to Victorias mother, the Duchess of Kent, for almost  years. Her remains are also held there, in an elegant mausoleum. The House - built in the s and purchased by Queen Charlotte, we of George III in  - is open to the public just one month a year, in August, plus three charity open days in June.  The sprawling grounds allowed Queen Charlotte to indulge her love of botany, as the gardens, initially flat, were filled with , trees and many rare and unusual plants. Charlottes Vice-Chamberlain, Major William Price, and the Rev. Christopher Alderson of Derbyshire transformed the estate, creating the winding lake, wooded mounds, glades, walks and bridges in the Picturesque style. Tickets cost up to pound a person through the Royal Collection Trust. Inside, there are grand and elegant rooms - including one decorated by th-century flower painter Mary Moser. Princess Elizabeth, the daughter of George III and Charlotte, painted garlands in The Cross Gallery.  The Britannia Room is furnished with items from the Royal Yacht Britannia, which was decommissioned in . Watercolours by Victorias daughters, Princesses Victoria and Louise, are still in the House. Public access is extremely limited because Frogmore House, currently uninhabited, is still used by the Queen and other members of the Royal Family as a retreat for private and official royal engagements. Frogmore House was built by Hugh May, Charles IIs architect, and given a name that refers to the abundance of frogs in the surrounding, low-lying marshy area. It became a royal residence about  years later and has become a hideaway for royal couples and families, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and their children.  Victoria was fond of Frogmores peace and quiet, and it is said to have been her favourite retreat, visiting during her long widowhood and working on her papers there. Frogmore Cottage was once home to Abdul Karim, Victorias Munshi, or teacher. A summerhouse in the form of a Gothic ruin and a teahouse made for Victoria are both still standing on the estate. George VI and the Queen Mother honeymooned in the grounds in . In , it hosted the wedding reception of Princess Annes son Peter Phillips and his Canadian we Autumn. Last year, the Queen called it a wonderfully relaxing environment that holds a special place infamily’s affection.

The horric story of the capture of Bellfield has been told over the last three nights in ITV drama Manhunt. In the book upon which it is based, former Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton says that during his investigations he discovered Bellfield had been at the centre of the sickening rape yet shockingly was never even questioned, even though he gave the victim’s freshly laundered clothes from the night of the rape to the police. It occurred in June , just two months before Bellfield bludgeoned French student Amelie Delagrange, , to death.   Sutton, who led the successful investigation into Bellfield’s murders of Amelie, and -year-old Marsha McDonnell, which in turn led to his conviction for the murder of -year-old Milly Dowler, dedicates a chapter of the new book, published tomorrow, to this baffling incident, describing Bellfield’s ability to escape suspicion for the rape as “staggering”. Sutton believes it is possibleBellfield had been treated as a rape suspect then, he would not have been free to go on and kill Amelie, but adds: “With hindsight you can say that was the turning point, the opportunity that was missed. He is cunning and clever and good at avoiding responsibility for what he has done.” Sutton explains the episode began when Bellfield demanded a vulnerable friend, Peter Rodrigues, store  ecstasy tablets for him in his sick mother’s empty flat while she was in hospital. Simultaneously, Bellfield, who already had a teenage lover, received the news from her that she had a -year-old friend in desperate need of a place to stay.   The girl, Sutton describes, was in trouble for a separate drug offence and had fallen out with her parents. He outlines how Bellfield appears to have spotted an opportunity for more sickening abuse, and arranged for the girl to stay at Rodrigues’ mother’s flat – where he demanded Rodrigues drug her and await his arrival. The next morning the girl woke up remembering nothing, in strange clothes, and in pain – knowing she has been raped, but not by whom. She rang her friend, who asked Bellfield to collect her and bring her to his flat, which he did.   Shortly afterwards, a worried Rodrigues confronted Bellfield and was seriously assaulted by the killer. But cunning Bellfield phoned an ambulance and told paramedics and police his ‘good friend’ had been attacked by two other acquaintances. Officers initially smelt a rat and did question Bellfield over the assault, but he stuck to his story, and with Rodrigues unconscious for weeks, he walked free. When the rape victim later revealed to police she has been drugged and attacked, and also mentioned the assault on Rodrigues, police even turned to Bellfield for help in finding the flat where it may have taken place. Charming as ever, he directed them, labelling Rodrigues a drug dealer and telling them where the drugs would be stashed. Even when Bellfield revealed he had the victim’s clothes, washed of all evidence, his part in the incident was seemingly not questioned at all. Sutton says: “Bellfield, for reasons I cannot explain or discern, was never investigated as a potential suspect and that investigation was closed.”   Adding: “As he had done for most of his adult le, he gave a good impression of a man who was a friend to the police, who knew lots of people and lots of things, and who could be a very useful contact for the future. “It seems he succeeded, once more, in manipulating a dficult situation to his own advantage.” Sutton says: “I had no doubt that Bellfield’s behaviour throughout this episode had been criminal and yet he had never been properly investigated. “The concept of him being allowed to drop off a rape victim’s clothing without further inquiries being made as to his role in the offence was staggering. “The information we had gained from the victim and the other young girls placed him squarely at the centre of events, yet he had been ignored.” He adds: “I can’t understand the circumstances where someone would say ‘I can you get you those clothes I’ll bring them into you’. “Why that was allowed to happen I don’t know.” Sutton and his team soon learned of Bellfield’s grim history of violent and sexual abuse of women and girls during their investigation into the murders of Amelie and Marsha, and the attempted murder of another Londoner, -year-old Kate Sheedy. It is now also known he was involved in a paedophile ring targeting girls in children’s homes in west London.   He says that by speaking to numerous sources including the young rape victim herself, Sutton was able to piece together Bellfield’s murky world – and also understand the charm he used to wriggle out of suspicion by making himself helpful to police. Bellfield had been used as an official informant previously by officers, but was eventually dropped as he considered too dangerous. In this case, Sutton says, the officer involved acted only “naively” and “unprofessionally”, not for “personal gain.” When Rodrigues eventually came round weeks later he was charged and pleaded guilty to possession of drugs, receiving a suspended prison sentence. Bellfield though was never charged with anything connected to the incident. And Sutton believes this will not have been the only time Bellfield got away with a crime - sure there will be many more victims who suffered at Bellfield’s hands without justice. “I don’t knowhe’s killed anyone ,” he says, “but I think there will be hundreds of people assaulted or abused or attacked by Bellfield over the years.”Manhunt: How I Brought Serial Killer Levi Bellfield To Justice, by Colin Sutton, is published by John Blake on Thursday, priced pound.."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures mummified man show you","story":"NewsPictures of mummied man show why you should NEVER put an egg in a microwaveFactory worker Saul Morton, , had cooked eggs using this method at least  times before without a problem however on this occasion he was left in agony and rushed to a specialist burns unitShareCommentsByHelen Le Caplain:,  JAN NewsFactory worker Saul Morton was in excruciating pain \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA egg-lover was left bandaged like a mummy after his breakfast exploded in the microwave leaving flesh falling off his face. Saul Morton was cooking eggs for himself and a pal at work when he decided to poach the eggs in a mug of water in the microwave for  seconds. The factory worker had seen the method being used on an online tutorial. However when microwaving the second egg, it blew up, showering his face in a scalding spray - even burning his left eyeball.  Thinking he literally had egg on his face when he saw white peeling from his eyelids, cheeks and nose, the processing plant sht manager was horried to realise it was his flesh falling away. Saul, who is himself a first aider, was rushed to hospital and then sent to a specialist burns unit where he received treatment. Now back at work, the -year-old is sharing painful-looking pictures of his injuries to warn others against cooking eggs in this way. Saul, from Pantymwyn, Flintshire, said: I was in agonising pain, it felt like when you spill scalding hot water out of the kettle and catch yourself - but all over my eyes and face. I ran to the bathroom from the canteen after it happened and washed my face with cold water. At first thought I had egg white stuck all over my face but then I realised it was my skin peeling off my eyelids, cheeks and nose. When that happened, and my face started to swell up, thats when I knew it was time to ring for an ambulance.  Saul, who was making the breakfast snack at .am on December , said hed cooked eggs using the same method at least  times before without a problem. Saul said: I was making bacon and egg sandwiches at work - Ive cooked eggs in this way for years and never had a problem apart from this one time. Id seen a professional cooking video showing this method on the internet but there was no warning this might happen. Id already done one egg and made a sandwich. As I removed the second egg from the cup it exploded and I saw this flash of white liquid coming towards my face. The general consensus is that a membrane formed over the water in the cup and when I pierced this with the spoon the water below flashed to steam and blew out of the cup - it was a freak accident.   Saul was rushed to Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, by ambulance where he received pain relief and his face was covered in a soothing gel dressing. He was then wrapped in the mummy-like bandages for  hours. Saul said: I was bandaged like a mummy - but the gel and bandages saved me. They put the bandages on my head and then cut slits out for my eyes and mouth so I could breathe. I couldnt see very well with them on so I stayed at my parents house. Im a big Liverpool fan and that night my dad had to describe what was going on on Match of the Day when we beat Bournemouth -. The following day he was taken to Whiston Hospitals burns unit in Prescot, Merseyside, by his dad Alan Morton where specialists examined his scorched skin and prescribed eye ointment and a weeks worth of antibiotics.   Saul said: I was in excruciating pain as some of it splashed on my left eye, but the ointment they prescribed meant there was no lasting damage. The gel forms a scab over the burns and once that was on I didnt feel anything. After a week it started dropping off and I was back at work two weeks later. It healed so well the scar clinic discharged me fairly quickly. When Saul ed to work colleagues had chipped in to buy him a novelty egg-themed gt in recognition of what hed been through. Saul said: When I went back to work the lad had bought me a game called Egg Splat - it was to be expected. Ive got a bit of a red mark on my nose but thats it. I was lucky, it could have been a hell of a lot worse. Im a safety conscious person and take all these precautions but this still happened. Poaching eggs in microwaves just isnt worth it. I just want to make people aware that this can and does happen.

Last years brutal conditions wreaked havoc for millions - trapping drivers on motorways overnight, grounding flights and forcing schools to close. This years warning has sparked fears that parts of the UK could see a repeat in the coming weeks - and Britons have been urged to prepare for severe and le-threatening winter weather. The same weather warnings and patterns from last year have been spotted again this month, with the Met Office saying an icy Siberian blast cannot be ruled out.   Before a cold snap hits, however, the UK will see above average temperatures for January over the weekend, although they wont feel pleasant in places where it is wet and windy. Wednesday got off to a cold start with temperatures dropping to -C in northern parts of the UK and -C in southern areas overnight. The Met Office warned that frost was likely on untreated roads and pavements, so drivers and pedestrians should take care. Showers are expected along some eastern fringes throughout the day, while Northern Ireland and Scotland will see cloudier and milder conditions as the day progresses.  Patchy rain will spread east, and it will be cold but dry where, with some sunny spells. Outbreaks of rain and drizzle are likely across the north in the evening, while the south will be drier with a frost overnight. On Thursday, patchy rain across northern areas will spread southwards while temperatures stay mild in most places. Friday through Sunday will be largely cloudy by generally mild, the Met Office said.  There will be some rain at times, particularly across northern areas, and it will turn breezy across the country with a risk of gales in the north. Looking further ahead, a Beast from the East could bring a spell of freezing temperatures and heavy snow, the Met Office warned. It said a sudden stratospheric warming had appeared around Christmas, when there was a sharp increase in the temperature over a couple of days. When this happens in the Arctic it can lead to a rush of cold air blowing eastwards across Europe a few weeks later, bringing much cooler temperatures to the continent.  The Met Office said this is what caused the Beast from the East early last year. Spokesman Grahame Madge said that another Beast from the East could not be ruled out, but the current forecast suggests there will be stable weather conditions. He said: Last year there was a classic set-up with the Beast from the East, there was an event in the Arctic - sudden stratospheric warming - where the stratosphere warms rapidly. That triggers, generally, a change in the direction of winds across Europe at surface level. The upshot is that normally when this happens in the Arctic you get easterly winds and thats what happened last year. But although that warming has happened in the Arctic already just prior to Christmas, we are not seeing any change in an easterly pattern. Met Office five-day forecast Wednesday Showers will affect some eastern fringes through the day, especially at first. It will turn cloudier and milder across Northern Ireland and Scotland through the day, with patchy rain spreading east. Cold but dry where, with sunny spells. Wednesday night Cloudy conditions will spread across the north with outbreaks of light rain and drizzle. Further south it will remain drier with a frost forming under clearer skies. Thursday After a bright start across the south, cloud and patchy rain across northern areas will spread southwards through Thursday. Away from southeastern areas, it will be milder for many. Friday to Sunday Largely cloudy but generally mild. Some rain at times, particularly across northern areas through the weekend. Turning breezy for all, with the risk of gales developing in the north.

And more worrying, lots of people are actually bidding for them, with one already attracting  offers.The Quorn-stuffed sausage rolls will be available in  of Greggs , stores across the UK for pound. Roger Whiteside, chief executive at Greggs, said: Like many food retailers we have seen increasing demand for vegetarian and vegan products. We have been trying to develop a vegan version of our famous sausage roll for some time now.   It has not been easy but our taste  customers all love this one, so we have decided to launch it as our contribution to Veganuary. Amid all the excitement, we sent two of our team to taste the vegan sausage rolls to see what they thought. This is what meat-eater Laura Connor and vegetarian Amanda Evans thought. Meat-eater: I have no idea why Piers Morgan felt the need to throw up after eating this – it’s yummy. The Quorn-filled puff pastry is melt-in-the-mouth and the spicy filling hits the spot, just like the meat version. Vegetarian: According to staff at Greggs, customers have been going “crazy” for the new, no-meat roll since they introduced it last Thursday. Mine was steaming hot and fresh out of the oven. I liked the taste, and the consistency was appealing. Now I know what all the hype is about with their  layers of puff pastry.

But one mum is furious after receiving a large bill for Christmas dinner at her sister-in-laws house - as she thinks its a rip off. Writing on Mumsnet, she said: My [sister-in-law] said she would host Christmas this year as she has a big new house and plenty of room for us all. I askedI should bring something and she said she would just do a shop and split the cost. She did suggest we bring our own alcohol. I thought it was a little odd, as did my hubby but he reminded me that she was cheap and the food wouldnt cost that much anyway! Best to just agree with it instead of making a fuss. Anyway we had Christmas, I took up  bottles of wine .Left them there when we left. We were given cereal for breakfast and tinned soup for lunch and a basic Christmas dinner. No puddings and just a little cheese for dessert.  We just got the bill... it came to pound each! [Am I being unreasonable] to feel angry and insulted by this all  It doesnt seem right to hand over money. Especially to family. Also I feel really ripped off!I dont want to upset my husband, but his family are a new level of cheap. If I did that to my brother, he probably wouldnt speak to me again! The post received over  comments, and people on the parenting forum were ided over the matter. Some thought the mum should cough up what was previously agreed and others said it seemed like way too much for what they had.One wrote: pound each is crazy, I wouldnt want to pay that, suggesting a breakdown of the costs.Another agreed: Id demand back the wine, then! Others expressed their disbelief at the cost of pound per person, particularly as it didnt include alcohol, dessert or other extras, and slammed the sister-in-law as cheeky and a cheapskate.A few Mumsnet users reckon the mum should pay up, given that they had agreed to split the cost before.One wrote: Seems odd to me, but you agreed to it beforehand, so you should pay. I think that asking for a breakdown of the bill is going to cause more trouble than it’s worth! The mum posted again to say that she plans to pay but will make her excusesinvited again next year.

Not only was Macca a popular player in his five years at Tannadice, he also had the knack of scoring against Dundee in derbies.Even so, when he was appointed in October, there was barely a murmur of discontent over his United connection.Many others have been on both sides of the street at one time or another and been welcomed by the punters.Going direct from one to the other has not been uncommon either and, strangely, the only time there has been a fuss was with a transfer that was proposed but didn’t quite happen.That was back in the   season when both clubs were down in the old First Division and cash-strapped Dundee accepted a six-figure bid from United for their exciting young winger Neil McCann.When news of the proposed deal leaked out, however, such was the furious reaction from Dark Blues fans, the board had to call it off and, a short time later, McCann, until recently manager, was instead sold to Hearts.At other times, though, players have crossed the street with barely a whisper of complaint.It should be said that was often because the ying fortunes of the teams meant there was little the one losing one of their squad could do to prevent the move.Equally, there have been instances where fringe players at one team were allowed to go. The most notable of that second category came when Tommy Coyne headed to Dens from Tannadice in .Signed by the then-defending champions from Clydebank in  for £,, Coyne could never quite make the breakthrough into Jim McLean’s side.That meant when United’s greatest-ever manager allowed him to head for Dundee, three years later and for £, more, the bigger gamble being taken seemed to be the one by Dens boss Jocky Scott.It proved to be a masterstroke on his part and, not only did Coyne score  goals in just over  appearances, when he left for Celtic in  it was for a whopping fee of around £,.A success heading in the other direction was the Tele’s own Lee Wilkie, who joined boyhood heroes United from Dundee in .Big Lee went on to lt the Scottish Cup in , although by that time he had been sidelined by the knee injury, ironically first suffered in a derby while playing for Dundee, that would end his career.In terms of medal success, Iain Phillip stands as the only man to win a major competition in both dark blue and tangerine.The defender-cum-midfielder was part of the Dundee side that shocked Celtic in the  League Cup Final and, after ending his second spell at the club by joining United in , got winner’s medals in the same competition in  and  – the latter when he started against Dundee in the final at Dens Park.Others to have moved directly from one to the other include Albert Juliussen, Ian Scott, Billy Williamson, Bobby Robinson, Neil Duffy, Beto Naveda and, more recently, Scott Robinson and Paul Dixon, who departed under freedom of contract."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c34a24c46e147.33250561.jpg ","title":"defender andrew davies given chance to seal dundee move","story":"Experienced central defender Andrew Davies will get the chance to earn a move to Dundeehe can prove his fitness to former boss Jim McIntyre.The -year-old was this week released from his contract with Hartlepool, despite having  months remaining on that deal at the National League club.The Englishman was linked with a move north to Dens Park last week to rejoin his former Ross County boss in his bid to engineer an escape from relegation.Now a free agent, Davies is expected to be on the manager’s wishlist and could arrive at training over the next couple of days to join the Dark Blues.Davies was an integral part of Jim’s successful Staggies side, moving to Dingwall in the summer of .He was quickly made club captain there and led the side to the  League Cup towards the end of the following campaign.The former England U  international stuck around at Victoria Park until their relegation last summer.After his release he joined non-league English side Hartlepool United where again he was made skipper after signing a two-year deal.That, though, has only lasted  games and six months after the deal ended by mutual consent on Monday.Meanwhile, Dark Blues youngster Matty Henvey is set to join Cowdenbeath on loan this week.The -year-old goalgetter has made three substitute appearances for the first team this season under previous boss Neil McCann but is yet to feature for Jim McIntyre.The current management are keen for Henvey to get some gametime at a lower level and the Blue Brazil have jumped at the chance to take him till the end of the season.A player who already exited Dens Park this month, Adil Nabi, has joined Greek Super League newcomers OFI Crete.Nabi’s short-term deal at Dens came to an end at the start of January and he’s been snapped up by last season’s second-tier champions in Greece.Their vice-president is former Celtic and Manchester City striker Georgios Samaras.n Tickets are on sale from the club for Dundee’s next match, the Scottish Cup home tie with Championship side Queen of the South next weekend."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c34a1eb663092.42912058.jpg ","title":"dundee council in talks to renew vital air link to london stansted with funding set to run out","story":"Council chiefs have begun talks over renewing funding for Dundee’s air link with London.The local authority, along with the Scottish and UK governments, signed a deal in March  to provide the Dundee-Stansted route with backing of nearly £ million as it was not commercially viable on its own.But funding runs out in March this year so council chiefs are in talks to extend the deal, saying it is “vital” that the route continues.A spokesman said: “The air service between Dundee and London is vitally important to the city and wider region.

He brought me into the team against Inverness last month and again against Thistle on Saturday.“After Inverness I had a wee while out because of illness but he’s brought me back in again and I enjoyed it.”Despite his tender years, for the Dundonian having to impress a new manager at United is not something new.Such has been the turmoil there since he was first signed up that he’s had more gaffers than many players come across during the course of their entire careers.“I think it is about seven managers I’ve had here now and I’m only , so there have been a few. It is tough because I’ve never had a manager who has brought me into the team and given me a run of games.

I’d like to play in the holding role in the middle because I’ve played there as well but, even though the manager has started me on the wing, he wants us to come into the middle and get on the ball there.”Smith has performed well under his new boss at a time when United have been struggling to maintain the momentum they were building shortly after his arrival.The youngster admits that’s been frustrating but believes United are not far away from ing to winning ways on a regular basis.“Saturday was very frustrating. After Ayr and Ross County dropping points we were looking to get a victory but it wasn’t to be.“Partick came at us first half to be fair to them. I thought in the second half we were very good and we can, hopefully, take that into this week against Dunfermline.“There are no bad teams in this league and, at times, you just need to battle it out in games.“We did that in the first half and I think in the second half we showed up better.“We got the goal back in that second half and then had a lot of chances to win the game, we should have been more clinical and finished them off.“We need to keep grinding results out.

We could see Sam had attributes.“Although he was young, raw and didn’t have a lot of experience, we thought there was enough there that we could work with.“Testament and credit to Sam as he has thrown himself into what we put our players through, sports science, to get quicker and stronger.“Sam probably feels now he belongs at this level and it is great that the fans have recognised that in recent weeks.”In-form goalscorers are hot property and, while the new contract rewarded Cosgrove’s recent goal , it is also a potential blocker to interest from other teams.Having struggled to secure a regular game for Carlisle United in League Two, McInnes insists Cosgrove now believes he belongs in the Scottish top flight.He said: “The biggest thing now is that because of the goals he has scored Sam is becoming more confident.“The biggest ingredient for any striker and any young player is that confidence.“Sam’s contribution for me has always been very high, even though the goals haven’t always come.“But scoring goals brings more exposure and people highlight that more.”In the aftermath of Cosgrove’s disastrous debut, McInnes insisted he would stick by the striker.He was true to his word and has kept faith with the big centre-forward.Despite having scored just two goals prior to the League Cup final on December , Cosgrove was given the nod to start at Hampden against Celtic, in the Dons’ - loss.In the next game he was harshly sent off in the first half of the - defeat of Rangers at Ibrox.Cosgrove received a second yellow for a challenge on Connor Goldson, although the Don had clearly won the ball.Again, in the aftermath, McInnes stuck by the striker, insisting he would not be hit with a club fine for an “astonishing” dismissal.McInnes said: “I have no discipline issues with Sam.“He puts himself about but he is smart with his work as well.“Sam doesn’t get involved in situations.“That was onewhere there was a rush of blood.“The Rangers sending off was wrong and we lost him for the rest of that game.“We also lost him for the St Johnstone defeatand that for me sticks in my throat.“It was the wrong decision and meant Sam was unavailable for the next game.“That game we could have done with Sam as he had been doing well.“I have no problems with him in terms of the discipline side as he is a smart striker and plays within the rules of the game.”Such has been Cosgrove’s impact in recent weeks the Red Army have begun tongue-in-cheek chants at games, calling for him to be awarded the Ballon d’Or.McInnes said: “We want Sam to get hold of the ball, look after it, win his headers and give us that physical presence. It is so important for any team to have that.“Sam helps us get up the pitch and has been good for us.“His performances have been noted more recently because he is scoring goals.“If Sam doesn’t score people will still beat him up and question him.“Some people expect a lot but in terms of his footballing development and experience, he is so young but is doing particularly well.”"},{"url":null,"title":"reds wish tansey well with st mirren","story":"Greg Tansey said he was “delighted” to have joined St Mirren after agreeing an end to his ill-fated, injury-ravaged spell with Aberdeen.With manager Derek McInnes and his squad on their way to Dubai last night, a Dons statement revealed an agreement had been reached to tear up Tansey’s Pittodrie deal with a year-and-a-half left to run.A spokesman said: “Aberdeen Football Club can confirm we have reached a settlement to terminate Greg Tansey’s contract.

It’s phenomenal.“They’re like children in a sweet shop the way that they attack them.“It’s the nutrients in the bark that they love so much, because trees can pick up some trace minerals from the ground that grass and other things can’t.”Specialising in rare breeds, Sarah chose to get bagot goats – one of the rarest in the UK with only around  left in the country – in a bid to clear weeds from her fields.Sarah has been caring for rare breeds for more than  years, in a bid to preserve them for the future.She is on the hunt for real trees that have been used over the Christmas period, but that haven’t been sprayed with anything such as fake snow or articial pine scents.Trees that have been kept close to kitchens will also not be accepted, because of the chance of contamination with food, which could cause an outbreak of foot and mouth.For Sarah, asking for the trees was an easy decision, especially as there is currently a hay shortage.She said: “There’s a huge waste of trees around this time of year, it seems criminal – especially this year when fodder is in such short supply, because a lot of the silage and hay has already been used.”This is the third year Sarah has recycled trees and she has been kept busy trailing across the north-east picking up trees from people.She said: “It’s been absolutely fantastic, I’ve even had some of the village trees that have been standing out in the squares. They’re fantastic because they’re usually quite green.“It’s been a great response from the local community.”Despite the fact the goats don’t eat the wood of the trees, Sarah manages to find a use for it, whether it be for kindling for her wood burner, or passing it on to a lady in the village who makes wooden children’s toys.She said: “Every part of the trees I get is used in some way.“The things I can’t burn, I put out the back to rot for the insects. It all gets used one way or another.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/5c344c7e4a3d91.65090573-386x564.jpg ","title":"north east film director jon s baird martin scorsese is the best mentor i could have","story":"Having one of the world’s greatest directors take your calls and offer advice is something even the most experienced Hollywood film-makers would give their right arm for.But that’s exactly what Jon S Baird, from Peterhead, can do with Oscar-winner Martin Scorsese – and he calls it one of the greatest things to come out of his career.Scorsese, director of classics like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas, was the man Jon called as he was preparing to shoot Stan  Ollie, which hits cinemas on Friday.The film follows the legendary comedy double act as they set out on a iety hall tour of Britain in , and starts with a long one-take shot following Steve Coogan and John C Reilly across the backlot of a Hollywood studio. It was a complicated sequence to film and Jon turned to Scorsese for advice on the best way to shoot it.The pair first met when Jon was hired to direct an episode of US television series Vinyl, which Scorsese produced.Jon – a huge fan of Scorsese’s  film The King of Comedy – said: “The thing that really benefitted me in my career, and still is, is my relationship with Mr Scorsese. That’s been the greatest thing to come out of my work in television in the States and the doors that has opened for me.“We spoke about the backlot shot and he advised on some of the lens choices and how to co-ordinate the background artists because he’s the master of that – the modern master anyway of those long shots.”Scorsese’s admiration of Stan  Ollie is no secret – to the extent he hosted a special screening in New York just before Christmas with Jon and the cast.“He’s seen Stan  Ollie and loves the film,” said Jon.“He’s really supported it and helped it. He’s a very good mentor, probably the best mentor to have. I go and see him every time I’m in New York.“It’s quite an unusual thing for somebody who comes from a small fishing town to end up having that. It’s a real dream come true.” vw, px\"  Jon says dreams of a le in showbiz were not something he contemplated growing up in Peterhead – orhe did he kept them to himself.He said: “My mother was a nurse and was a stay-at-home mum and looked after us very well.“My dad was in construction and neither of them went to university or had any particular interest in the arts.“But we would go to London every year to visit my uncle and we’d go to see musical theatre and that was the highlight of the year for me.“We watched things like Oliver! My Fair Lady and Cats, and I think that was what sparked my interest in this kind of world. Before film, really.“If you told anyone in Peterhead you wanted to be a film director, they would have thought you were a bit mad.“I didn’t really tell anybody what I wanted to do until I moved away.”Although he applied to film school, he didn’t get in, blaming his grades and the times he “messed about” at Peterhead Academy.“My grades weren’t great at the academy,” said Jon.“Education didn’t seem to be the most important thing.“My career didn’t start until I moved down to London and started as a runner – basically a teaboy – and worked my way up.”In , he directed parts of the short-lived BBC satire The State We’re In, which featured an early appearance by John Oliver, now the star of award-winning HBO comedy Last Week Tonight.Jon said: “John Oliver was a writer no one had heard of and I was directing his inserts. I wasn’t doing that well, he wasn’t doing that well.“Cut to  years later, maybe more, and I switched on the TV and there was John on HBO with his own show. I was at the premiere of Vinyl, which was a show I did at HBO, and he was there too. I went up to him and we reminisced about the times we couldn’t get arrested for work.”After making his directorial debut in  with a short film called It’s A Casual Le, Jon made the biopic Cass in , about the le of writer and football hooligan Cass Pennant, then adapted the Irvine Welsh novel Filth for the big screen in .But even as his films get bigger in scope – Stan  Ollie is his largest budget yet – Jon says the homegrown support is something he’s never taken for granted.He said: “I’ve had a massive amount of support from people in the north-east towards my career.“I get texts from people I haven’t seen in years saying we’ve seen what you’re doing and we’re really proud of you and that means more than anything.“I still consider it my home and who I really am. So regardless ofI didn’t have the background in, or the family connections in film, I still feel as though, weirdly enough,I hadn’t grown up in the north-east, I might not have ended up with this career.“I might have ended up in something  purely because it was foreign from what I was used to, it was the big draw to go into the unknown.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/dno-1-118x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"residents praise north east sheltered housing complex during inspectors visit","story":"A north-east care home resident has praised the facility, saying its the best move they have ever made.Inspectors from the Care Inspectorate spent time at Abbey Court, a -flat sheltered housing complex on Sutherland Drive, Mintlaw, on December , and the report has now been made public.As well as the praise from the resident, the watchdog branded the complex “very good” for care, support and staffing, the second-highest ranking handed out by the watchdog.One resident said: “The best thing I ever did was to move in here.”Another said: “I’m reassured staff are thereI need them.”The report said: “There was a wide range of meaningful activities on offer in the complex.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13808455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_shr_ayp_281218weight2.jpg","title":"woman lost weight after deciding","story":"NewsWoman lost weight after deciding to do something before it was out of controlThe -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier.ShareByStephen Houston:,  JAN NewsDeborah Biggar \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHer name is a headline writer’s dream. For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"campbells-return-is-written-in-verse","story":"RETURNING rector Campbell Wilson was given a warm

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single curriculum anda single headteacher will be appointed to oversee its management.The decision to push ahead with the plans came despite a public consultation which found only  per cent of those who took part were in favour of the proposal, with  per cent against it.And it was revealed that while the parent council of the infant school was for the merger, the same body from the primary school had opposed it.Fiona Robertson, East Lothianrsquos head of education, said that following those results she had arranged to meet face to face with parents at public meetings in a bid to tackle their concerns.She said: ldquoIt is really important we work with the parental community and I took part in further meetings with parents because in their minds to say closure sounds like their school is going to be shut and there were concerns about operating over two sites.Mrs Robertson said that Helen Gillanders, headteacher of Dunbar Primary School, which operates over two sites, also attended meetings to discuss how her school operates.The merging of the two schools was supported by all four ward councillors at a meeting in Haddington.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader, said it was ldquothe most important decision we make\".He said: ldquoPupilsrsquo le chances are affected by their school experiences and both schools play a signicant role in this community.He acknowledged that there had been concerns from some parents but pointed to a recent inspection at Prestonpans Primary School which had called for additional support to be given to the school after grading its

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment.

Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"quarter-of-women-tricked-into-getting-pregnant","story":"The women who all attended sexual and reproductive clinics became pregnant against their will and reported they were not being allowed take control of their contraception.They said they were subject to control or coercion over their reproductive lives, a British review of American studies has found.The review found that control over womenrsquos reproductive choices was ldquocommon, with one- quarter of women in US studies over seven years reporting that they had experienced it.One of the reportrsquos authors, Professor Sam Rowlands, said there was no research on UK women so the scale of the problem was unknown, but he imagined the proportion would be similar.Mr Rowlands, a doctor and visiting professor at Bournemouth University, said UK health professionals were missing chances to help women who are facing pressure over getting or staying pregnant.He said: ldquoI think we do need to replicate some of these studies, just to be sure that itrsquos happening, but most of us who have worked in womenrsquos health, we know from talking to women that this definitely happens, so I think itrsquos not whether it happens, but itrsquos whether it happens to the same extent as some countries. And then also people need to be thinking about training, and getting people to raise this a bit more proactively in consultations, and then how to handle it when you find it.The report, published in the British Medical Journal, analysed nine studies on the prevalence of reproductive control in women from  to . It defines the phenomenon as ldquoactions that interfere with a womanrsquos reproductive intentions and any actions that pressurise a woman into initiating or terminating pregnancy.Primarily carried out by intimate partners, it can also be perpetrated by the wider family and in organised crime, with young people and ethnic minorities particularly vulnerable.Actions include emotional blackmail, threats of violence, pressure to continue or end apregnancy or to not use certain types of contraception.It also includes ldquocontraceptive sabotage, such as a male partner ly saying they have had a vasectomy, piercing condoms before use, or ldquostealthing, where a condom is covertly removed during sex.Some women may not have insight into their relationship, especiallythere is no physical or sexual violence, as they may become inured to the control being exerted on them.Describing how it could manest, Mr Rowlands said: ldquoI think it is like a spectrum, at the worst extreme end there probably is violence and extreme things going on like food deprivation, on the other end itrsquos really just a kind of psychologically controlling atmosphere ndash keeping tabs on everything the woman is doing, maybe being restrictive over when she goes out.However, Mr Rowlands said that, for many women, the issue was not being raised during consultations. He said there were no UK guidelines or advice for health professionals, the majority of whom ldquowere not terribly aware and would not be thinking about raising this.Health professionals who were conscious of it were responding on an inidual basis to inidual patients, he said.The report is calling for screening to take place in maternity, sexual and reproductive health and abortion services and GP surgeries, with a set of questions already devised.Professionals should be alert to its possibility. Where women say they are being controlled, professionals may advise them on ldquoconcealable methods of contraception."},{"url":null,"title":"mps-seek-to-wrest-control-of-brexit-process-with-move-to-block-no-deal-scenario","story":"Labour is set to support a backbench amendment to the Finance Bill - which implements Budget measures - that could severely restrict the Governmentrsquos taxation powers unless, that is, a no-deal Brexit were taken off the table.If the Opposition whips its MPs to support the proposed change, tabled by Labourrsquos Yvette Cooper, then, given it has the declared backing of the SNP and around a dozen Tory MPs as well as the expected support of the Liberal Democrats, then the amendment could succeed.One Whitehall source warned the move could ldquoparalyse governmentimplemented.In a parallel move, Theresa May is due later today in Downing St to meet a number of the -plus signatories, from across the parties, calling for a mechanism to avoid a no-deal Brexit.David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, has warned that EU withdrawal without a deal would be ldquocatastrophic to the economy while David Gauke, the Justice Secretary, has hinted he would resign from Cabineta no-deal ever happened it is thought, he would not be alone.In the Commons as the Prime Minister once again insisted she was continuing her mission to seek ldquofurther assurances from the EU on the Irish backstop, Jeremy Corbyn went on the attack.Asking an Urgent Question, the Labour leader claimed it was clear Mrs May had achieved nothing from her festive round of diplomacy and branded her Brexit Plan ldquoFrankensteinrsquos monster.He declared: ldquoWith less than three months until we reach the Article  deadline there can be no more hiding and no more running away.\"This issue will define Britains future and should not be decided by the internal machinations of the Conservative Party this House and this country deserve much better.\"Mr Corbyn asked Stephen Barclay, the Brexit Secretary, for guarantees that \"faced with yet another humiliating defeat, the Prime Minister wont just run away\" from next Tuesdayrsquos vote. He demanded a \"cast-iron promise\" that the vote would not be dropped again.Declaring Labourrsquos proposal was \"riddled with contradiction,\" Mr Barclay told Mr Corbyn: \"The reality is he opposes the preparation for no-deal, which any responsible government needs to make, while at the same time saying he will vote against the deal it is that internal machination in the Labour Party that he needs to address.\"Ian Blackford for the SNP also insisted there had been ldquono progress over the Christmas break and that the PMrsquos intention was clear: to run down the clock on Brexit so that MPs would be deprived to any alternative to her Plan.Urging Mr Corbyn to ldquoget off the fence to support a Peoplersquos Vote, the Highland MP called for the Article  process to be extended to avoid a clf-edge departure and noted, to vocerous support from the Nationalist benches, how the Brexit process had simply made ldquoeven stronger the case for Scottish independence.Mr Barclay said the SNP was caught in a constant refrain in which it called for referendums but could ldquonot cope with their results. He urged it to respect the largest democratic vote the UK had ever seen.Meanwhile, the UK Governments no-deal Brexit lorry test was branded a pointless farce by critics after fewer than  lorries turned up.However, the Department for Transport defended the practice run, dubbed Operation Brock, which saw lorries descend on Manston Airport near Ramsgate and travel to Dover.

Not that we were left loo-less for long, with no thoroughly modern, Presto-toting town centre being thought complete in those heady days unless it boasted a brand spanking new toilet block too. Complete with bleach-wielding attendant, of course.Fast forward to , however, and those well-tended toilets are facing an uncertain future, with Aberdeenshire Council last year transferring responsibility for them to a local heritage group as part of a cost-cutting drive. The group has vowed to keep them running for the foreseeable future, with a community-spirited local cleaner and a couple of helpers stepping in to provide their services free of charge.The situation is far from unique. Research published in this newspaper last month showed that across Scotland the number of public toilets has reduced by  per cent in the past five years, with a third of the  that remain expected to be sold off or closed in the coming months. In towns and villages across the country solutions are being found, with local authorities paying small sums to local businesses infor public access to their facilities in a so-called lsquocomfort partnershiprsquo arrangement.As in my home town, other community groups have taken full responsibility for their local loos, with the Cumbrae Community Development Company - aka The Cumbrae Cludgies - proving just how successful community ownership can be after taking over management of the islandrsquos six public toilets in . Millport has been judged Hidden Scotlandrsquos most beautul town and its Newton Beach one of Keep Scotland Beautulrsquos best beaches since, with its gleaming toilets helping clinch the awards.Yet despite the stellar work being done by Cumbrae lsquoCludgie Cleanerrsquo Suki McGregor, who not only ensures the facilities are kept pristine but promotes the island in YouTube videos too, the group has turned to crowdfunding in a bid to raise the pound, needed for its survival. Running toilets is an expensive business, you see.But is it an expensive business that the public should pay for from the good of its heart through donations of time or money, or should our publicly funded bodies continue to foot the bill  A decade on from the advent of former prime minister David Cameronrsquos Age of Austerity, we all know money is tight, but Irsquom still willing to argue itrsquos the latter.It goes without saying that the loss of public toilets sends a negative message to the visitors our rural communities depend on in order to thrive. Itrsquos one thing throwing money at advertising campaigns whose romanticised vision of our hills, glens, food and drink is designed to lure tourists in, butthey canrsquot access even the most basic of services once they get here theyrsquore hardly likely to give us a glowing review.Andwelcoming holiday-makers isnrsquot your thing, think on this: without easy access to a public loo many elderly members of our communities, whose social interactions have already been curtailed by the automation of pension payments, the closure of local banks and the soaring cost of a cup of tea, may well give up on venturing down the town altogether. Consigning the elderly or infirm to their homes rather than finding ways of ensuring they can remain a part of the community is hardly the mark of a civilised society.And that, really, is the crux: far from being a simple inconvenience, the loss of public lavatories serves as a reminder of just how uncivilised our society has become. From streets smeared with dog dirt to towns left without libraries, the symptoms are everywhere. The narrative might be that by closing toilets councils are cutting back on a service they are not legally obliged to provide, but the wider story is that after a decadersquos worth of austerity-led budget cuts we have been reduced to accepting the budget version of civic le.The latest manestation is the introduction of fees for school music tuition, a move that is to be derided not just because it separates out the rich from the poor but because it implies that only the former are deserving of enriching experiences. In West Lothian alone, , school kids have dropped out of music lessons since an annual fee of pound was introduced. If that isnrsquot a wake-up call that austerity isnrsquot working, what is On its website the Cumbrae Community Development Company states that ldquoa community that cares about its public toilets sends out a strong message about the type of community it is.

At the other side of Glasgow, Rangers have signed Kilmarnockrsquos Jordan Jones and Dundeersquos Glen Kamara on pre-contracts and have brought in Steven Davis and Jermain Defoe to help with their title tilt this season.:Write off a silverware hungry Jermain Defoe at your peril, says Rangers boss Steven GerrardDefoersquos move has been arguably the most eye-catching signing in the Premiership so far in January and has sparked debate over whether or not the -year-old still has what it takes to compete at this level. Wersquove decided to take a look at the Englishmanrsquos stats to see exactly what Rangers fans can expect from their new man.Defoe has always been seen as a natural goalscorer and with  goals in the English Premier League itrsquos not hard to see why. The ex-Spurs striker is the seventh-highest goalscorer in the competitionrsquos history and has spent almost the entirety of his career in Englandrsquos top flight.The graphic above charts Defoersquos goals per  minutes in league football since the   season and the results make for impressive reading. Even during the forwardrsquos worst season in front of goal, in  , he was still averaging . goals per  mins, or around a goal every four gamesyoursquod prefer. This is hardly prolic, of course, but it isnrsquot a poorin such a demanding league.:The Bulletin: Gerrard Further signings depend on moving players on | Hibernian keen on Lewis MorganPerhaps unsurprisingly, Defoersquos best goalscoring campaign came in the   season when he was playing for MLS side Toronto but of the  seasons hersquos spent in Englandrsquos top flight, Defoe has averaged more than a goal every two games on seven occasions. Even as recently as  , the forward was scoring . goals per  - a figure not to be snfed at.By analysing Defoersquos scoring rate over the last  seasons, we can see that there are peaks and troughs but - much to the encouragement of Rangers fans - there is no sustained period of clear decline. Yes, Defoersquos goalscoring rate has dropped in the last two seasons but there are a couple of mitigating factors here. Firstly, that during   Defoe was tasked with banging in the goals for a truly dreadful Sunderland side that looked destined for relegation from the opening day. And secondly, that last season at Bournemouth he was a bit-part player, often coming off the bench and rarely given a run in Eddie Howersquos starting XI.If we take Defoersquos average goals per  minutes over the last three seasons as a representative sample, the figure we arrive at is .. Itrsquos important to point out that these are goals scored in the English Premier League, where the standard is higher than the Scottish Premiership, yet even going by these numbers it appears Defoe will have plenty to offer to Rangers during his time at Ibrox.:Rangers boss Steven Gerrard calls for respect to be shown towards referees after Old Firm fall outA more in-depth look at Defoersquos numbers reveals that the veteran strikerrsquos role has been changing in recent seasons. Where Defoe has traditionally been characterised as a goalscorer, we can see that as age catches up with the -year-old, his style of play has evolved.We can see that Defoersquos goalscoring has dropped signicantly - particularly last season when he wasnrsquot featuring regularly for Bournemouth - but other aspects of his game have actually improved in recent campaigns. While the English forward is scoring fewer goals and hitting fewer shots, his accuracy has increased to the point where the majority of his efforts on goal are on target.Interestingly, Defoersquos expected goalshas remained fairly consistent during this time, implying that hersquos still being given the same number and quality of goalscoring opportunities during any given match, but hersquos converting fewer of them. This may be slightly worrying for Rangers supporters, but they can take heart from the fact that Defoersquos team play has improved over the same period. The number of key passes - passes that lead directly to a shot - that Defoe averages more than doubled last season and the number of touches that hersquos taking in the opposition box has also risen.Defoersquos dribbling has suffered at the same time, however, with the number of attempted dribbles per  minutes dropping from . to . and with good reason in  , around % of the forwardrsquos dribbles were successful, but that figure plummeted to % last season.All in all, then, it looks as though Defoe still has plenty to offer and should prove to be an important player for Rangers during the second half of the season. Gerrard has already asserted that Defoe is ldquoa very young -year-old and that the striker ldquohas a shape to die for in terms of how he looks after himself in response to questions about age creeping up on the forward. The stats suggest that, naturally for a player Defoersquos age, there has been a drop-off in some aspects of his game, but his goalscoring record throughout his career suggests that he wonrsquot struggle to find the net this season. Whether or not Defoe has what it takes to make it in Scotland remains to be seen but there are plenty of reasons for the Rangers support to be optimistic about his arrival."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-cameron-leigh-griffiths-gets-my-sympathy-but-why-does-he-make-his-life-so-damn-difficult","story":"Itrsquos luck, really, which allows us to show the world whatever our inidual talent handed out at birth happens to be.For example, had I been raised in the Amazon Basin instead of directly across the road from a pub, would my genius, the right word, trick of flicking up a beer mat and catching it with the same hand before it hits the table ever have been discovered There are a select few blessed with such incredible talent that it elevates them above almost all of the rest, an ability which even in an elite field marks them out as someone truly special.Leigh Grfiths is one of them.This is someone possessed with a ridiculous amount of natural talent for kicking a ball with a left foot which could double up as a wand. He should have been one of Scotlandrsquos all-times greats.Many years ago, I took a trip through to Edinburgh to write up a feature on Hutchison Vale, the football club which boasts a ridiculous number of ex-players who went onto play professionally.John Collins, Darren Fletcher, almost everyone who has ever played for Hibs, and Allan McGregor are just some of the graduates. The list goes on and on.While there, I asked who was the most naturally gted player to ever darken the door of Hutchie Vale, thinking it would be Fletcher. The answer I got has never left me.A coach said that it was the young lad who then had only just broken through at Livingston, and was scoring goals for fun, who beat Collins and Fletcher, two modern greats of Scottish football.It was put to me Leigh Grfiths was the best that club had seen but there was a problem. He was something of a lad. Easily led and prone to distraction.And Irsquom putting it mildly.Just the other day someone I respect in football said to me that Grfiths should be playing for a team at the top of the English or German league. Hersquos that good, this man said and he knows what hersquos talking about.But with Grfiths there is always a but.He denied this week he is a gambling addict, insisting his problem is with mental health issues.

The next piece of silliness was never far away. Itrsquos ashersquos as good at self-sabotage as he is at scoring goals.Grfiths is troubled but has a good heart. Itrsquos just that he is man seemingly incapable of dragging himself clear of chaos. Hersquos the pal who can get into an argument and then a fight while putting out a milk bottle. Trouble finds him and this now -year-old has to take a lot of responsibility for that.Grfiths loves Celtic. But maybe it is time for him to leave.

Perhaps even more exciting is the potential to manage these within a mosaic of their natural neighbours.ldquoOur aim is to see native woodland, montane scrub and open moorland habitats meshing naturally with each other from sea to sky. That would encapsulate all that a restored landscape can be, not just in Torridon but across the Highlands.Ben Shieldaig covers about , acres, set in the dramatic Torridon landscape within the Wester Ross National Scenic Area.Known for its walking routes and spectacular views from the summit towards Skye and the Outer Hebrides, the area is home to two rare types of woodland.The Trust described Ben Shieldaigrsquos birchwoodland, confined to the moisture-laden strip of land between the mountain and the sea, as ldquoScotlandrsquos rainforest.Part of a unique habitat shaped by the mild climate and clean air, it contains some of the worldrsquos rarest lichens, bryophytesand liverworts.It is also home to a signicant remnant of ancient Caledonian pinewood that has occupied thespot ndash at the very limit of the Scots pinersquos northern European distribution ndash since just after the last ice age.The pinewood is one of the most westerly remnants of native pine in Europe that is oneof the closest to sea level and possibly alsoone genetically unique to the north-west of Scotland.The existing woods are in good health andnotable for a lack of non-native invasive species, such as Rhododendron ponticum.The Trust says a combination of naturalregeneration and planting, along with effective deer management, could see a tripling of woodland cover on the mountain.The mountain and its surrounds are alsohome to famous Scottish wildle, including sea eagles, golden eagles, red squirrels, pine martens and otters.The UKrsquos smallest dragonfly, the black darter, and the vulnerable azure hawker dragonfly have both been recorded there, as well as the Red Data Book-listed hover fly Callicera rufa.The Trust says a full site survey could also reveal pipistrelle bats, smooth newts, woodpeckers and siskins.Ms Evans added: ldquoWe aim to manage the site for wildle and people and encourage recreational access ndash perhaps building a small car park and creating a path to a viewpoint for visitors toenjoy.\"We will consult local people about our plans once we secure ownership. Before anything can happen though, we need to raise the money to fund the purchase.Ben Shieldaig is Scotlandrsquos ,th highest peak and is classied as a Marilyn because it hasa prominence of at least

told listeners it was vital schools intervened to help pupils as early as possible and that, while there were those who opposed assessments in P, others emphatically argued in their favour.The Scottish Liberal Democrats decided to put that claim to the test issuing a freedom of information request to the Scottish Government asking who those people were.The response from officials appeared authoritative enough, referring to ldquoextensive research highlighting the positive benefits of formative assessment.ldquoFor example, Dylan Wiliam ... presents research that shows formative assessment practices have a much greater impact on educational achievement than most other reforms, it said.The response came as something of a shock to Mr Wiliam when presented with it this week by The Herald, describing it as a \"substantial, and perverse misrepresentation\" of his work.Crucially, while Mr Wiliam believes some early assessments can help evaluate the progress of pupils, such as with basic letters and sounds, he does not believe the Scottish assessments are capable of providing the sort of support that would lead to improved teaching.The Scottish Government argues there was no intention to imply he supported the policy, but Mr Wiliam is deeply troubled by the inclusion of his name, given the rather marked disparity between his views and the policy.ldquoThe interesting question, of course, is whether the author of this document really believes what is written here, in which [case] he or she is too stupid to be doing that job, or whether they know they are being deliberately misleading, he said.As Liberal Democrat Tavish Scott has already pointed out, it is completely unacceptable for the work of such experts to be referenced in this way either by accident or

national assessments of P children are simply incapable of providing the kind of information that I think teachers would need in order to teach better.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Wednesday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top.

This is a new permanent  scheme.Councillor Matthew Reiss, Thurso and Northwest Caithness, a former senior police officer with a particular interest in road safety, said: ldquoIf you have a lower speed limit, safety is improved ndash that is a fact.ldquoIf the local residents are happy with it then Irsquom very happy. With many parked cars on the streets there is always a chance of children walking out between them and not being seen. Slower cars will cut the chances of any potential accident.The civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, Wick and East Caithness, said research had shown a big reduction in collisions in built-up areas in towns and villages following the introduction of mph zones. They also improved the character of residential areas and the quality of le for residents, he added.Councillor Andrew Sinclair, Wick and East Caithness, admitted to being a bit sceptical when he first heard about the proposal. ldquoIt sounded like change for the sake of change. Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Wednesday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118855.jpg","title":"Oldest reactor is set to go","story":"WORK is expected to start at Dounreay early in the new year on a multimillion-pound contract to dismantle Scotlands oldest nuclear reactor.The contract ndash understood to be valued at around pound million ndash has been awarded to Cavendish Nuclear following a tendering process and is expected to last about three years.

The issue was highlighted in the Courier of November  and Highland Council made aware of the most recent spate of vandalism in which first-floor windows were broken.A former janitor had confronted boys throwing stones at the windows and had previously alerted police when he saw people walking about on the roof of the former technical department.Speaking about her efforts to make the building safe, Councillor Sinclair said: \"I first asked for this work to be done several months ago but officers in every department are very stretched both for time and money, so I am pleased that the work has finally been completed and thank the people involved, both council and contractor.\"However, she stressed that it was only a \"small step forward\" and that it should \"not take elected members months of asking to have this small amount of work done\".She said: \"The council as a whole needs to consider whether it has become so bureaucratic and centralised that it effectively disempowers its own members. I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings.

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As we expected, with any windfarm development, our announcement attracted a range of views — and these have been taken into consideration when developing the plans.#We undertook to keep the local and wider community closely involved as the project progressed and we#re looking forward to heading out to Hoy to discuss revised plans with local folk.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Well done to Pat Munro for taking an interest in the company and especially as it is local. Good luck with your negotiations.Another added: ldquoWell done Brian Munro. A good deal done there.The award-winning Carbon Dynamic, based at the Cromarty Firth Industrial Park, announced earlier this month it was unable to continue trading due to ldquochallenging conditions and signicant cash-flow dficulties.As a result,  local jobs were made redundant with just two workers kept on.But on Wednesday joint administrators Blair Nimmo and Geoff Jacobs of KPMG said the business had been sold to Pat Munro, safeguarding the future of the firm.Carbon DynamicLimited, a new company, has been set up to facilitate the purchase.Mr Nimmo said: ldquoIt is extremely pleasing to secure the sale of Carbon Dynamic in such a short time-frame, and to buyers who can see the potential in the business and its skilled workforce. The sale has achieved a good outcome for many stakeholders and we hope it will benefit the local area.ldquoAs new owners, Pat Munro has an ambitious vision to build on Carbon Dynamicrsquos reputation for cutting-edge design and manufacture of eco-friendly modular buildings, re-employing a number of Carbon Dynamicrsquos former staff and contributing to the ersity of the economy in the Scottish Highlands.Brian Munro, managing director of Pat Munro, which is one of the largest privately owned contractors operating in the Highlands, said: ldquoWe collaborated [with Carbon Dynamic in previous successful projects and were very saddened to learn of the financial situation which threatened the future of  important local jobs. As such, we are delighted to add Carbon DynamicLtd to the Pat Munro Group and we are committed to continuing, and enhancing, their superb progress to date.Cromarty Firth SNP councillor Maxine Smith, said: ldquoI am very pleased a local firm with a conscience has bought out Carbon Dynamic. Pat Munro will take good care of it.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

I had received other such callsfrom Jer over the years but I was never available to join him, untilthis year, so I called my friend and comrade Larry OToole and we metJer in Gaffneys in Fairview in the aptly named snug The OfficersMess. It was an unforgettable afternoon with Jer. He had been very ill in hospitalnot long before and while he was in great form, both Larry and I feltthat this was almost like a goodbye. Little did we think that lessthan a month later Jer would be gone from us. He died on StStephen’s Day. November. And as always his conversation ranged widely - from thefamous ambush in West Cork to Dalymount stadium and his beloved Bohs,from the streets of the North Inner City with the Dublin Brigade inthe s - and indeed the s - to the Dubs winning four in a rowin , from the docks of our city to the plains of the AmericanWest, from a Dublin stage to a Hollywood set. Jer did entrances and exits well,befitting a man of the stage, and even the shortest of time in hiscompany was entertaining. He knew the power of words and versestripped easily from his tongue. His accent was deep and Dublin, aswas everything about him, the historic Dublin of the working class,locked out in , rising up in , resilient and proud of itsheritage of struggle. In his day Jer was an IrishRepublican Army Volunteer and a political prisoner. He was asocialist republican through and through in the tradition of JamesConnolly and in the style of his idol Jim Larkin. He embodied Larkinon many occasions and at many events. He was always available to do aturn for The Cause - be it trade union, republican or internationalsolidarity.  We asked him to read theProclamation at the Dublin Sinn Féin Easter commemoration inGlasnevin in  and he proudly obliged. Previously at many of ourEaster commemorations over the years he had read James ConnollysFinal Statement to his Court Martial to great and stirring effectoutside the GPO. In  he performed Larkin with us at thestatue in O’Connell Street to begin the Centenary of the Lockout,and again at the Liberty Hall conference organised by Sinn Féinearly that year. A more poignant memory is of Jeras Wolfe Tone at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in , bicentenary of theUnited Irish Rising. He was accompanied by a group of pike men andwomen, among them his son Diarmuid who died so tragically later thatyear in a fire in Glasgow, after a Celtic game which father and sonhad attended. Leaving the stadium that day, Jer saw his son for thelast time. The loss of Diarmuid was a terrible tragedy for Jer andhis partner Eithne, who died in December , a further loss fromwhich Jer never recovered. Among Jers talents was as adesigner of banners, which he produced with Eithne, and many of whichcan still be seen at trade union rallies. He championed the use ofthe original green, silver and gold Starry Plough as designed for theIrish Citizen Army and flown in Dublin at Easter , and, thanks inlarge part to Jer, it is now widely seen and recognised. It wasplaced on permanent display in the Oak Room of the Mansion House forthe first time, when as Ardmhéara I accepted it as a presentationfrom the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. And it was in the Oak Room,under the Starry Plough, that we gathered on  January to pay tributeto Jer with a night of eulogies, music and song. In October  Jer joined us forSpraoi ar an Sráid, the Moore Street Party that I organised asArdmhéara, in support of the campaign to save the  battlefieldsite. As always, he was proud and glad to answer the call. Once againthat day he passionately declaimed the words of the Frenchrevolutionary Camile Desmoulins, as quoted by Connolly and Larkin: \"The great are not great. Thegreat only appear great because we are on our knees. Let us arise!\" Many hundreds of people attendedJer’s funeral on  January. His coffin was draped in the StarryPlough and passed his North Strand home on the way to the church in aprocession which included some of his finest banners. The attendancewas a cross-section of the republican left, in all its ersity, aswell as people from the theatre, the trade union movement and hismany friends and neighbours. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonaldattended, as did Gerry Adams. In a tribute Mary Lou said: \"Ní bheidh a leithéid arís ann agus mara dúirt Jer féin go  minic an Phoblacht abú.\"Deepest sympathy is extended to Jer’s daughters Noraand Clare and to all his extended family.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27512  ","story":"The attack at Burntollet Bridge. Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonIt is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.Peoples Democracyemerged as one of the constituent parts of the wider Civil Rights Movementin the north of Ireland during the late s.It was a collective of radical students influenced like the rest of the emergent CRM by global events and motivated by a resolve to bring an end to the injustices of the then unionist state.Inspired by the political example of the Selma to Montgomery march organised by the American CRM, the PD and notably without the approval of the wider CRM, decided to march from Belfast to Derry in a highly symbolic protest against the denial of democratic and civil rights in the north.The march began on st January and eventually arrived in Derry on Saturday th January .  But, not before it was violently confronted by unionist extremists, supported by members of the B-Specials state militia, as it passed through Antrim town and Randalstown in South Antrim, and then most notoriously at Burntollet Bridge, outside Claudy and finally again at Irish Street in Derry, before finally arriving at the citys Guildhall.and Brackareilly, near Maghera.Where the route of the march was blocked by unionists, local people provided transport to the next clear point on the journey.Among the numbers to join and support the marchers as it passed through South Antrim and South Derry were local republicans, including IRA volunteers and members of the then Republican Clubs local Hibernians, social democrats, as well as other progressive minded people, who recognised the importance of the march, and respected those participating. The Long March to Derry as it came to be known made its own historic contribution to the demise of the old unionist regime in the north of Ireland.So to mark this landmark event, fty years on from the actual date of the ambush on the marchers at Burntollet, Sinn Féin in my South Antrim constituency organised an evening of reminiscence and political discussion, compered by the author and Sinn Féins former Director of Publicity, Danny Morrison.A specially produced video by Noel and Noel Óg Maguire was shown, sharing local peoples eye witness accounts and recollections of what happened in Antrim, Randalstown, Toome, and also at Burntollet.Civil rights veterans, and former Sinn Féin MLAs, Mary Nelis and Mitchel Mc Laughlin, and myself then participated in a  discussion.That reviewed the pre-civil rights period, how the CRM came into existence, and how the civil rights era gave way to the political conflict, leading up to the peace process, and the present day political situation.It was an excellent event, with an audience spanning three or four generations from South Antrim and South Derry.Some present were reconnecting with historical events which they helped shape, and which in turn shaped them: others were of an age to draw parallels between their own contemporary experiences of rights denied today with the denial of rights fty years ago.What the Long March to Derry in , and the sequence of other events of that same year, climaxing with the pogroms of August , brought sharply into focus was that partition remained the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society: and, that the denial of civil rights in the north was, and remains inisible from the denial of Irish national independence. Following the RUC assault on the civil rights marchers in Duke Street, Derry, on th October , the Long March to Derry again exposed for a world audience the institutionalised sectrarianism of the northern state, and extent of unionist opposition to the equality and rights agenda.Nothing would ever be the same again.It took a further thirty years before the Good Friday Agreementdrew a line under the use of political violence provided the political architecture of the Irish peace process and, established in legislation equality and human rights for all citizens in many ways the GFA addressed what the CRM did not resolve.It gave expression with an internationally binding treaty to the crux of the CRM agenda, by establishing the bench marks of equality, rights, and respect for all citizens.It became our societys road map away from the legacy of political violence towards the achievement of a rights based society, with parity of esteem, mutual respect and anti-sectarianism, at its core.Both the British and Irish governments have failed to fully implement the GFA.Just as the unionist state in  opposed the CRM, signicant sections of political unionism have pushed back against the GFA since .It is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,  a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.And, that is the fundamental reason why the democratic political institutions in the north remain suspended and why the GFA faces its greatest ever threat.Make no mistake, there is a deep systemic crisis in the north of Ireland.Now that crisis is deepening with the onset of the Brexit catastrophe.Brexit has swept away all of the previously established assumptions about the constitutional, political and economic status quo in Ireland north and south.A solution to the depth of this crisis will only be found through negotiation and decisive political leadership, which commands the authority to make and keep agreements, and embrace and deliver change.Those who marched from Belfast to Derry fty years ago this week were a microcosm of the wider CRM.They were students and others, including, republicans, social democrats, communists, socialists, trade unionists, and labour members.

The North Antrim DUP MP told the News Letter that the “continuous campaign of terror” waged by the IRA had “stunted the economic growth” of Northern Ireland.“It is convenient for nationalists to ignore this as their ideology benighted from its consequences,” he added. “Despite the  years of terror, NI has survived, now boasts the lowest levels of unemployment in our history, the highest levels of inward investment outside of London and is a hub for many key businesses. Nationalism survives on a dialogue of talking down NI hence I am not surprised by such comments.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8762003.1546953788!/image/image.jpg","title":"tree mendous recycling efforts","story":"The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim has thanked residents who are #treecycling# after Christmas.In the run-up to the festive season, the council encouraged citizens to recycle unwanted items and responsibly dispose of all waste, including Christmas trees.And Mayor Lindsay Millar said she has been impressed by the number of people visiting Household Recycling Centres in order for their trees to be turned into high-quality compost for our parks and gardens in Mid and East Antrim.Cllr.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

Not initially aware of his good fortune, the two cash-strapped women learn that their patient won’t be around for long and are then faced with a moral dilemma of should they or shouldn’t they… Long time Marie Jones collaborator Katie Tumelty told Daily Belfast how the play has a “universal voice” in its themes that are as prevalent today as when the play was first performed back in .“This play deals with the working woman, in this case two care workers who are running to and from the people that they care for on a daily basis,” she said. “Their work is invaluable to so many families but in the cases of Frances and Loretta there is more going on behind the scenes. Marie’s play deals with poverty, death and dilemma but at the same time has so much humour running throughout it.“Both characters are hard workers, they have stresses in work, stresses at home and they are just trying to make ends meet and get through their working day. I play the character of Frances who looks at the same sky as everyone  every morning, has hopes, aspirations and it’s like many peoplethe situation arises – what to doa small amount of money, should it be £ or £, comes their way, do they take it “What starts out as a tiny grain of sand soon becomes an avalanche for the two women to deal with. The piece is Marie at her finest,” she added.Katie continued: “Everybody knows a Frances or a Loretta, they are going in and out of hundreds of home every day to help those in their care. I remember so many times being stopped in the Kennedy Centre with people saying that the show should be on prescription, that Marie should be getting her wages through the NHS such is the tonic the show has proven to be.”Fly Me To The Moon and its message have been welcomed around the world on stages in New York, Canada, Sweden and most recently Iceland.“For this run I’m performing with Abigail McGibbon and it’s like a homecoming for her as she performed the part back at the start.

We were found wanting and the players know that.#The only thing I will take from that is that it had reinforced in my own mind some of the players who are stepping up and others we will have to review.#Antrim actually hit the first point of the game through Paddy McBride in the opening minute, but they were to be swamped at the other end with the points flowing for Armagh before a stray Colm Fleming kick-out gave Ryan McShane a gt of a goal to move Armagh - to - ahead on  minutes.Their second major arrived a minute later, this time from a Jamie Clarke penalty after another stray pass resulted in Rory Grugan being hauled back in the area.By the time McBride added to the Antrim tally on  minutes, the game was gone as Clarke and man-of-the-match Stefan Campbell caused havoc at the other end with Armagh leading - to - at the half.McGeeney#s charges did appear to take their foot off the gas a little in the second half, but it was hard to blame them as the game became rather pedestrian.Credit to the hosts who kept plugging away with Niall Delargy and McBride leading the way in attack and they did grab a consolation goal through Eoghan McCabe with the last act of the game, but this was a rare blemish for Armagh who were worthy winners.“It’s the old adage of goals win games and once you concede two in three minutes it#s massive,” Harbinson added.“Armagh#s tackling was very good too and I thought maybe in the second half we were blown up for some easier stuff, but that#s the inconsistencies.“Armagh showed the desire of getting men forward and breaking lines, but we were just a bit slow in doing that.“It#s disappointing because the boys are working really hard and we know they are. We made eight changes from last week against Monaghan because we#re using the McKenna Cup to look at players, although some were enforced on us through injury. When you make all those changes, you run the risk against a very good team of being exposed and that#s what#s happened.”ANTRIM: C Fleming P Brannigan, R Johnston, A Sweeney P Finnegan, D Lynch, P Gallagher M Sweeney, E Walsh M McCarry, M Fitzpatrick, C DuffinK Quinn , E McCabe , P McBride .

Majority of UUP members loathe DUP and dont want a merger \"In each party you could count the Catholic members on the fingers of your hand, but it will surprise many people that the DUP is ahead of the Ulster Unionists,\" Prof Tonge said.He said it was surprising that the UUP had no programme in place to attract Catholic unionists as most members would like a more religiously representative party. \"Both unionist parties are currently beyond the pale to Catholics,\" he added.Around , UUP members were interviewed by the authors.Prof Tonge said the party was considerably larger than the DUP, boosting a membership twice the size. However, while almost a third of DUP members claimed to be \"very active\", only one in five UUP members did.The partys strength was in Northern Irelands least populated county, Fermanagh, where around % of members lived compared to % of DUP members.Prof Tonge said the UUP urgently needed to recruit in the more heavily populated counties of Antrim and Down. He revealed that, contrary to popular myth, the UUP had recruited young people in recent years.\"Fteen per cent of its members joined in the last seven years. The party has been very successful in Queens and the Ulster University. Where it needs to do better is with ordinary, non-university young people,\" he said.The UUP boosts more women members than the DUP - its % male to the DUPs %. But Prof Tonge said the centralised nature of the DUP meant greater control over candidate selection by the leadership with women heavily promoted.\"The rise of Arlene Foster to become Northern Irelands first female leader is symbolic of the DUPs deliberate attempts to modernise the image of the party in the face of their unionist rivals,\" the book states. \"Whether Arlene Foster would have been able to rise through the ranks of the UUP will never be known, but is still a question worth asking.\"Although the partys politicians are increasingly liberal on the issue, only % of UUP members support same-sex marriage. However, % believe Northern Ireland should have the same abortion laws as Britain.Whereas Free Presbyterians are the largest denomination in the DUP, they account for just .% of the UUP, which is split almost evenly - % to % - between the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian Church. UUP members are religious with % attending church weekly, although thats lower than the DUPs %. Almost six in  would mind a religiously mixed marriage in the family a little or a lot.The Orange Orders influence in the party is on the wane. Only % of councillors are members compared to % in the DUP, and % of MLAs . Around % of both parties members are in the Orange Order. Just over half of UUP members would transfer to the DUP in elections. A third said they would give a lower preference to the SDLP and % to Sinn Fein. Once an integrationist party, the UUP is now very pro-devolution which has % membership support compared to % for direct rule."},{"url":null,"title":"charity hails james mcclean for latest act of generosity","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Geri Cameron, president of the National Association of Head Teachers in Northern Ireland, said: “It is totally unsatisfactory, parents have had a very strong voice in telling us that it is not sustainable.”The budget for schools has reduced by about % in real terms over the past five years.The union leader added: “Schools are now at crisis point.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Rancour between the two main political parties over Brexit means it has been months since substantive political talks aimed at restoring devolution have happened Charlene Brooks, chief executive of Parenting NI, a family support organisation, said families were expected to buy extra items like stationery and contribute to the cost of particular lessons.“Parents have made it very clear that this has had an additional financial and emotional strain.“They talk about a voluntary contribution butone parent does not make it does that mean that their child is left out of a lesson and is more vulnerable to being picked on “Does that mean that that child stands out from the group “There appear to be much greater expectations on parents to pay towards things that they would not have to in the past.”It is unsustainable, the rates system no longer worksHospitality Ulster chief executive Colin NeillFacebookTwitterA spokeswoman for the Department of Education said % of the total budget for day-to-day running costs went towards funding schools and pupils.She added: “However, the department fully acknowledges the financial challenges facing schools and continues to make the case each year for additional funding, based on an analysis of the financial pressures facing the sector.“That said, we do not determine what the final outcome will be each year, as the education pressures are considered alongside other competing pressures across all departments.“Overall budget allocations to departments must be funded from available resources and are decided by ministers.“To benefit pupils, all grant aided schools are entitled to request or invite voluntary contributions from parents.”Endless rounds of political talks have failed to restore the Stormont institutions.An official probe into the Renewable Heat Incentivescheme and its threatened massive overspending is due to report later this year.The DUP wants to re-enter Government immediately but refuses to meet a republican demand for official protection for the Irish language.The unionist party’s stance against abortion and same sex marriage has rankled with its former partner in Government.Meanwhile, tourism chiefs are awaiting a long-overdue reform to cut red tape, and the tax burden on pubs contributed to one closing every four days last year, Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said.He added: “It is unsustainable, the rates system no longer works.”Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been unwilling to introduce full Direct Rule from Westminster, but has passed a budget to keep public services running and intervened in piecemeal fashion in policing and addressing the legacy of the conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"staggering northern ireland lorry driver four times over limit in petrol station","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Receiving the MBE is just totally surreal.ldquoIrsquom overwhelmed the work I do in safeguarding children and women has been recognised by the Queen.Sheila started to work as a front line practitioner in the field of social work  years ago. Today, she is Social Work Manager for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.She is also the chairperson of the South Eastern Area Domestic and Sexual Violence Abuse Partnership, a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency made up of voluntary and statutory community groups like Sure Start, Womenrsquos Aid and PSNI.Sheila said social workers were used to being on the receiving end of unwarranted bad publicity, but were expected by society to protect vulnerable children.She said: ldquoI first began to understand domestic violence when I became a social worker. I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential. It is available to all men and women affected by domestic and sexual violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for upgrade at Ardglass harbour  ","story":"THE need for major improvements at Ardglass harbour to allow signicantly larger vessels to enter the port has been highlighted by former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie.Her comments come after last monthrsquos annual EU Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels which determines how much fish can be landed at the local port and at the neighbouring harbours of Kilkeel and Portavogie.EU chiefs have decided to reduce prawn quotas by just over % to ensure the species ldquostays within sustainable levels, while the herring quota has been reduced by %.The Fisheries Council also determines how many days boats can put to sea, but the December meeting will have been the last UK fishermen were represented at ahead of the Brexit at the end of March.Welcoming some of the outcomes from the Brussels negotiations, Miss Ritchie has urged British and Irish governments to resolve what she described as ldquooutstanding problems in the fisheries sector to build the economies at the three Co Down fishing ports.She explained that the Fisheries Council consists of EU Fisheries Ministers who decide on the annual quota allocations for range of species mdash including prawns and white fish mdash which are the main staple of Northern Ireland fishermen.Miss Ritchie said she was concerned there has been a slight decrease in the amount of prawns which can be landed locally, after a series of successive quota increases over recent years.ldquoIt is important that the British Government has realistic proposals capable of implementation in place to safeguard and grow our local industry, said Ms Ritchie.ldquoThere are also other fishing issues that require resolution as they present ongoing challenges to the catching and processing sectors. They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

Among the middle-aged, just % thought the backstop makes unity more likely – but among under s, that figure more that doubled.The belief that the backstop would make unity more likely was also higher in border areas and other traditionally more republican areas such as Cork and Kerry.The polling, conducted in the run-up to Christmas, saw , adults being interviewed by pollsters Ireland Thinks. Eighty per cent of the interviews were by phone, with the rest conducted online. When asked who funded the research, the People’s Vote campaign said that most of its money came from public donations but that it has some large unnamed donors.Former secretary of state Lord Hain appealed to the DUP to not only reject Theresa May’s proposed deal, but also reject a no-deal Brexit and instead support a second referendum. The Labour peer, who backs a second referendum, said: “The DUP’s decision to back Brexit may yet come to embarrass them because there is no prospect of any sort of deal with the European Union that does not involve a backstop – and Irish voters see this as a step towards a united Ireland.Nationalist and republican parties now ‘anti-Catholic’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The DUP must also know that a ‘no deal’ would be a catastrophe for Northern Ireland, especially for farming communities in the border regions. The one thing the DUP is known for is having tactical ‘nous’ and the logic for them – as it must be for MPs of all parties in the House of Commons – is to back the idea of the public being given the final say in a new vote where people will be given an option of staying in the EU with the deal we’ve already got.”But the DUP’s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, said that the  vote had been UK-wide and “the result must be respected and implemented”.He said: “The party has been consistent on the backstop. It is not needed. No one is building a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Indeed, with every day that passes, it is becoming clearer that not even the Republic of Ireland ever believed the hard border spin. “The backstop will place a border between Northern Ireland and GB. That is unacceptable both constitutionally and economically. If the EU really cared about Northern Ireland, they would be no more willing to build an east-west border than they are to build a north-south border.”Mr Dodds said that his party wants to see “an orderly exit from the EU”. However, he added: “That can be achieved but EU intransigence must be replaced by a recognition that the backstop is not acceptable.”try catch            ..

Pic by David Young PA WireIt is only one element of the public services feeling the effect after years with no ministers to take decisions.Scores of pubs have closed due to unreformed red tape and taxation while major road building projects have been delayed.Sinn Fein’s late Stormont deputy first minister Martin McGuinness stepped aside two years ago on Wednesday in protest at his former powersharing partner the DUP’s handling of a botched green energy scheme.The impasse has created a decision-making logjam.Charlene Brooks, chief executive of Parenting NI, a family support organisation, who said families are expected to buy extra items like stationery and contribute to the cost of particular lessons to plug an education funding gap following the collapse of Stormont powersharing two years ago. Pic by Liam McBurney PA WireGeri Cameron, president of the National Association of Head Teachers in Northern Ireland, said: “It is totally unsatisfactory, parents have had a very strong voice in telling us that it is not sustainable.”The budget for schools has reduced by about % in real terms over the past five years.The union leader added: “Schools are now at crisis point.”Charlene Brooks, chief executive of Parenting NI, a family support organisation, said families were expected to buy extra items like stationery and contribute to the cost of particular lessons.“Parents have made it very clear that this has had an additional financial and emotional strain.“They talk about a voluntary contribution butone parent does not make it does that mean that their child is left out of a lesson and is more vulnerable to being picked on “Does that mean that that child stands out from the group On This Day  Years Ago : Hare treated cruellyKildare dean helps poor Rasharkin farm for sale Price of Goods Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“There appear to be much greater expectations on parents to pay towards things that they would not have to in the past.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said % of the total budget for day-to-day running costs went towards funding schools and pupils.She added: “However, the department fully acknowledges the financial challenges facing schools and continues to make the case each year for additional funding, based on an analysis of the financial pressures facing the sector.“That said, we do not determine what the final outcome will be each year, as the education pressures are considered alongside other competing pressures across all departments.“Overall budget allocations to departments must be funded from available resources and are decided by ministers.“To benefit pupils, all grant aided schools are entitled to request or invite voluntary contributions from parents.”Endless rounds of political talks have failed to restore the Stormont institutions.An official probe into the Renewable Heat Incentivescheme and its threatened massive overspending is due to report later this year.The DUP wants to re-enter Government immediately but refuses to meet a republican demand for official protection for the Irish language.The unionist party’s stance against abortion and same-sex marriage has rankled with its former partner in Government.Meanwhile, tourism chiefs are awaiting a long-overdue reform to cut red tape, and the tax burden on pubs contributed to one closing every four days last year, Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said.He added: “It is unsustainable, the rates system no longer works.”Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been unwilling to introduce full Direct Rule from Westminster, but has passed a budget to keep public services running and intervened in piecemeal fashion in policing and addressing the legacy of the conflict.try catch            ..

This is good for them and this is good for both colleges.“But what about the other % who do not, in particular what about those who are the most educationally vulnerable in the Lurgan area, why should their future be decided by those who go to Portadown schools or who are likely to be selected for one of the colleges.“The Education Authorityhave been working toward a solution and as part of that solution a number of options have been identied.“One of those options is for the children in Lurgan to stay in Lurgan and for the Lurgan Junior High Schools to become an – school with academic selection still taking place allowing children to go to the Lurgan College at . “However, this option is being discounted because of the words of the last Education Minister in June  where he made it clear that the Dickson Plan would not be removed ‘either directly or undermined through stealth’.“Yet it is clear that the Dickson plan is not being undermined and that selection will still take place at  with the option to go to Lurgan College at that time. Traffic and travel: M now reopened after SEVEN vehicle collisionMan charged over burglaries Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Therefore the former Minister’s words are being used not as they were intended but in an attempt to dissuade support for change. The adding of this statement will do nothing but reignite the bitter dispute around the Dickson Plan when there is no need to do so. It will feed into the fear of those parents and communities throughout the area who feel there is an attack on the Dickson Plan.“In itself it will create a negative response and fear that schools in Portadown will somehow be affected by a plan for Lurgan that puts Lurgan pupils and the Lurgan community at its heart.“I have been absolutely clear onwhere I stand on this issue. The children in Lurgan cannot stay at the Lurgan Campus site on Kitchen Hill, it is simply not fit for purpose, while bussing them to Portadown to a consolidated CSHS would be detrimental to the children and the wider Lurgan community.“Therefore creating an educational hub in Lurgan on the site of the Lurgan Junior High School through the provisions of - education would enhance education in the area while at the same time retaining the guidelines of the Dickson Plan with no detrimental effect on post primary schools and education in the wider Lurgan, Portadown and Tandragee area.“I am now calling on all elected representatives from all political parties in the area, civic leaders and educationalists to get behind a proposal for Lurgan Junior High School to become an - school with academic selection remaining at . I’m asking for parents from Portadown, Lurgan and Tandragee whose child is likely to go to one of the colleges or to the Portadown Campus of CSHS to support a Lurgan solution and I am asking the Board of Governors, teachers and Principals of Tandragee Junior High School, Clounagh Junior High School and Killicomaine Junior High School to support this bespoke solution for Lurgan and finally allow stability for those children and the community of Lurgan who have been badly forgotten over the last  years to finally have a sustainable post primary educational pathway.”An Education Authorityspokesperson said: “Craigavon Senior High School currently provides vitally important post-primary education services to the Craigavon area and currently operates across two campuses. “EA is undertaking consultation on how future provision at Craigavon Senior High School will be shaped. The purpose of this consultation is to seek the views of those most directly involved at a local level and will begin on Monday,  January, . “The consultation events will provide an opportunity to explore all of the facts and discuss the issues which will help shape future provision at Craigavon Senior High School for many years to come. “A letter inviting parents, staff and governors to participate in consultation events was issued on Monday,  January, . Consultation will also be undertaken with pupils during January .” try catch            ..

The Commission believed finding outthat had been done, and why, was “unnecessarily dficult”.Chief commissioner Les Allamby said: “The Commission is pleased that in response to this case the PSNI will now develop a clear policy addressing biometric data retention in Northern Ireland.“It will make clearer to the public why their DNA or fingerprints may be retained, on what basis this may continue, and how to go about seeking its destruction.“We are encouraging a quick implementation of this settlement to ensure that human rights continues to be a central tenet of how policing is delivered.”In December , the Commission issued judicial review proceedings against the PSNI on behalf of an anonymous inidual.That person had raised the refusal of the PSNI to erase fingerprints and DNA, which were retained following an arrest but release without charge in .The material was held because the inidual had been previously convicted of an unrelated common assault.The new public policy will take into account human rights and will provide guidance to the public on how they can find outtheir DNA or fingerprints have been retained, why this is so, and to challenge the decisionnecessary, the commission added.Mr Allamby said: “The commission acknowledges the importance of retaining DNA or fingerprints to assist with tackling crime.“However, the police must strike a proportionate balance when holding on to this sensitive personal material, having fully considered the inidual’s right to respect for private le.”Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Tim Mairs said the retention of the data had been in accordance with the law.Parents left to plug school funding gap as NI now without government for two yearsMuckamore Abbey parent: Declassied files show need for public inquiry Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“However, on consideration, we felt it was appropriate to delete the biometric data.“The Police Service of Northern Ireland are committed to delivering an effective policing service focusing on the rights of iniduals and keeping people safe.”PSNI has had a procedure in place since  where members of the public can apply to have biometric data deleted and the senior officer said he looked forward to working with the Commission to produce a formal public policy.He said PSNI was prepared to commence a new regime surrounding biometrics in  and following considerable work with partner agencies had in place a solution to comply with requirements.He added: “However, the legislation was not commenced by the Justice Minister at this time and so the implementation of the solution was delayed.“In the absence of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, and commencement of the legislation, the PSNI has decided to seek to commence voluntary compliance with the Criminal Justice Act on st November .“The implementation of this regime will be complex and will involve co-ordination of work across key local and national stakeholders.“We are committed to working with the Human Rights Commission to ensure we operate to the highest of standards in a manner that safeguards human rights, but also allows for law enforcement agencies to balance this with the detection and prevention of crime.”try catch            ..

Pic by Niall Carson PA WireAccusing Sinn Fein of “boycotting” the institutions, Mr Lyons said: “Two years without a government is not the wish of the DUP.“We believe in devolution. We want what is best for the people living here and that’s having a ing Executive and Assembly.”The DUP and Sinn Fein, former power-sharing partners at Stormont, have blamed each other for the impasse since deputy first minister Martin McGuinness stepped aside in January .Calling for an end to the current “political drt”, Sinn Fein negotiator Conor Murphy has warned that the Good Friday peace agreement, which paved the way for power-sharing, could become unsalvageablethe situation continues.“It is imperative we arrest the political drt that we are currently in and stop the attempts to unravel the Good Friday Agreement and its political institutions before it becomes unsalvageable,” he commented.“Public confidence must be earned and trust rebuiltthe Assembly and Executive is going to have any credibility.”Northern Ireland’s two largest parties are fundamentally ided on key issues such as Brexit and calls for an Irish language act.David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, said that two years ago he would not have believed the hiatus could continue for so long.“We are doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances, continuing to work with partners across the public sector and wider society, but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions that are urgently needed,” he said.“We want to see the Executive restored as quickly as possible as there is a clear need for fresh thinking and renewed policy impetus in almost every area.”Following legal delays, civil servants have been given the go-ahead to make major decisions.Nationalist and republican parties now ‘anti-Catholic’Traffic and travel: M now reopened after SEVEN vehicle collision Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"They are still guided by ministerial decisions which are now two years out of date and in many cases important policy decisions lie in abeyance.Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said recent research to be published by NI Chamber and BDO on Wednesday reveals that its members believe going into  without an Executive is extremely damaging to economic prospects – with more than half predicting a negative impact on their own business.“Firms are showing particular frustration around the damage caused to regional investment and local decision-making as well as the fact that Northern Ireland has no political voice in the UK EU negotiations,” she added.try catch            ..

The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They are in contact with the company to have it muted ASAP!” said Carla with the hashtags #depressing #santaisnotcomingtotown.A spokesperson for the council said soon after that they can confirm the music will be switched off that day.It caused uproar on social media with some agreeing with the MLA and others furious that she had little to do.However, veteran councillor Arnold Hatch believes she was out of touch with the community and business.Cllr Hatch, who is involved with Portadown Chamber of Commerce, asked: “What authority had Carla Lockhart to ask the Council to switch of the Christmas music two days before the contract ended “I think it is preposterous from someone who is not a councillor or a Director of ABC council to demand such action,” Alderman Hatch said.“I will be demanding answers from Council officials when theyto work on Monday.“I understand the complaint came from Lurgan, yet the music in Portadown was turned off too,” said Alderman Hatch.

This included piped music in Lurgan and Portadown which was to finish on  th January .“I want to know how many complaints there were, who took note of the complaint and who authorised the music to cease.“I certainly received no complaints from Portadown Chamber of Commerce. In fact, many agreed it helped to create a Festive atmosphere in the run up to Christmas and through to the January sales,” Ald Hatch said.Asked for a response Ms Lockhart said: “I think he will findhe speaks with businesses and people who live in the town centre he will get a very strong feel for the frustration caused by the music playing from early morning to pm at night one week after Christmas. Music was not the issue but the choice and I would have thought Council would have adopted the music repertoire after Christmas. “Mr Hatch has known me for a long time and can call me at any stage to discuss how elected reps conduct themselves. In his investigations he will find that the Lurgan Mail used the word ‘demand’ and I simply asked would Council consider turning the music off given that businesses and residents were frustrated.They informed me that they too had received calls in relation to it and they then obliged,” she claimed.try catch            ..

This is good for them and this is good for both colleges.“But what about the other % who do not, in particular what about those who are the most educationally vulnerable in the Lurgan area, why should their future be decided by those who go to Portadown schools or who are likely to be selected for one of the colleges.“The Education Authorityhave been working toward a solution and as part of that solution a number of options have been identied.“One of those options is for the children in Lurgan to stay in Lurgan and for the Lurgan Junior High Schools to become an – school with academic selection still taking place allowing children to go to the Lurgan College at . “However, this option is being discounted because of the words of the last Education Minister in June  where he made it clear that the Dickson Plan would not be removed ‘either directly or undermined through stealth’.“Yet it is clear that the Dickson plan is not being undermined and that selection will still take place at  with the option to go to Lurgan College at that time. Four vehicle smash on MMan charged over burglaries Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"“Therefore the former Minister’s words are being used not as they were intended but in an attempt to dissuade support for change. The adding of this statement will do nothing but reignite the bitter dispute around the Dickson Plan when there is no need to do so. It will feed into the fear of those parents and communities throughout the area who feel there is an attack on the Dickson Plan.“In itself it will create a negative response and fear that schools in Portadown will somehow be affected by a plan for Lurgan that puts Lurgan pupils and the Lurgan community at its heart.“I have been absolutely clear onwhere I stand on this issue. The children in Lurgan cannot stay at the Lurgan Campus site on Kitchen Hill, it is simply not fit for purpose, while bussing them to Portadown to a consolidated CSHS would be detrimental to the children and the wider Lurgan community.“Therefore creating an educational hub in Lurgan on the site of the Lurgan Junior High School through the provisions of - education would enhance education in the area while at the same time retaining the guidelines of the Dickson Plan with no detrimental effect on post primary schools and education in the wider Lurgan, Portadown and Tandragee area.“I am now calling on all elected representatives from all political parties in the area, civic leaders and educationalists to get behind a proposal for Lurgan Junior High School to become an - school with academic selection remaining at . I’m asking for parents from Portadown, Lurgan and Tandragee whose child is likely to go to one of the colleges or to the Portadown Campus of CSHS to support a Lurgan solution and I am asking the Board of Governors, teachers and Principals of Tandragee Junior High School, Clounagh Junior High School and Killicomaine Junior High School to support this bespoke solution for Lurgan and finally allow stability for those children and the community of Lurgan who have been badly forgotten over the last  years to finally have a sustainable post primary educational pathway.”An Education Authorityspokesperson said: “Craigavon Senior High School currently provides vitally important post-primary education services to the Craigavon area and currently operates across two campuses. “EA is undertaking consultation on how future provision at Craigavon Senior High School will be shaped. The purpose of this consultation is to seek the views of those most directly involved at a local level and will begin on Monday,  January, . “The consultation events will provide an opportunity to explore all of the facts and discuss the issues which will help shape future provision at Craigavon Senior High School for many years to come. “A letter inviting parents, staff and governors to participate in consultation events was issued on Monday,  January, .

According to the latest Real Estate Outlook report from CBRE, there was take-up of , sq ft of office space across  transactions, in . It says that was more than double the figure a year earlier. Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
