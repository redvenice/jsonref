Mrs Bateman\u0027s father, Bernard Buckley, was born in the Falkland Islands and worked in the cotton trade before serving in both World Wars\u0027They landed in Liverpool in 1915 and, because there had been a tremendous loss of horses in France, my father was sent straight to Lytham to break in wild horses imported from North America and Canada.\u0027He was eventually wounded at the Somme, but he met my mother during the war, they were married in Manchester in 1919 and returned to Chile, so I was born in the beautiful city of Punta Arenas.\u0027The mother-of-two met her late husband Philip in high school, and she married him in March 1948 before he passed away in 2014.She spent her working life as a nurse and Philip joined the Royal Navy at 18, before serving in the police force later on in life. The red poppy has endured for almost 100 years as a symbol of both Remembrance and hope for a peaceful future. Today, the flower is still worn as a show of support for the Armed Forces community and last year the Legion\u0027s annual appeal sold more than 40 million poppies to raise £50 million to help support serving and ex-serving members of the Armed Forces community and their families. Mrs Bateman said: \u0027It\u0027s just by chance that I own what is potentially the oldest poppy in the world.\u0027When I found it, it was nice to link it back to the picture of my four-year-old self that hangs on my wall and it\u0027s very historical indeed.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/11/4C8D340D00000578-5760939-image-a-5_1527070803732.jpg","title":"STEPHEN GLOVER","story":"Share this article I don\u0027t share the report\u0027s naive optimism. I believe the legalisation of drugs would lead to even more widespread abuse than exists now. More broken and unhappy lives. Probably more deaths.And we may be sure that the people who would experience the most deleterious effects of legalisation would not be the prosperous middle-classes but the marginalised and the most vulnerable.         Anyone found with a \u0027modest\u0027 amount would not be arrested or fined, let alone sent to prison. Offenders wouldn\u0027t acquire a criminal record. Instead, they would be given the chance to get help for their drug use (Pictured middle, Sarah Wollaston)Underlying the Committee\u0027s report is a dangerous misconception, which is shared by almost everyone advocating the decriminalisation of drugs. It is that we have a punitive drugs policy. We don\u0027t.It is true that in theory you can get a seven-year jail sentence for the possession of Class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine, and up to five years for possession of Class B drugs such as cannabis. But in practice such extreme penalties are seldom, if ever, applied.Indeed, some police forces have given up prosecuting people who smoke the stuff. Five, including Durham and Surrey, have announced, without any apparent shame, that they will turn a blind eye to cannabis for personal consumption.This is despite the fact that smoking it is illegal, and the existence of a growing mountain of evidence that repeated use of the more extreme forms of cannabis such as \u0027skunk\u0027 can cause schizophrenia and other forms of psychosis.And it\u0027s not just possession which the police ignore. Devon and Cornwall Constabulary discovered 194 cannabis farms in a four-year period but brought charges against only 79 suspects. Cannabis factories with specialist heating in West Yorkshire, Suffolk, Essex and Kent have also been spared.The authorities take a harder line against suppliers of Class A drugs but increasingly let off users. For example, Avon and Somerset police have introduced a scheme allowing people caught with heroin or crack cocaine to choose between prosecution and an education programme.         Five police forces, including Durham and Surrey, have announced, without any apparent shame, that they will turn a blind eye to cannabis for personal consumption (stock image)One only has to imagine the average middle-class consumer of hard drugs. Does he or she ever have the remotest fear of being caught and charged by the police? Of course not — unless another more serious crime has been committed at the same time.So despite all the liberal angst about our supposedly draconian failed drug policies (seemingly shared by the Health and Social Care Committee), the fact is we have a remarkably easy-going regime.Many of those proposing decriminalisation claim it is the only way of reducing drug-related crime. Why not try another approach that has scarcely been explored — namely, robustly applying the law against drug abuse? Oh, that would be too much of a challenge.So the would-be reformers instead recommend that a door which is already much more than slightly ajar should be thrown wide open. The likely outcome would be increased use of drugs, particularly among the poor and deprived.In Portugal, which is held up by the report as an exemplar of the effective control of drugs, the national drugs agency released figures in 2017 showing that the number of people using cannabis has risen by more than 40 per cent since decriminalisation in 2001.Moreover, the widespread abuse of prescription opioids in the United States suggests that the easy availability of hard drugs tends to increase consumption. Hundreds of thousands of people there — and an increasing number in this country — are hooked on them.         The authorities take a harder line against suppliers of Class A drugs but increasingly let off users (stock image) According to the American Journal of Public Health, deaths in 2016 from opioids dished out by medics were 50 a day using what is described as a \u0027conservative\u0027 method of analysis, and 89 a day employing what is termed a \u0027traditional\u0027 approach. That\u0027s close to an epidemic.In all likelihood, the legalisation of Class A drugs in this country would lead to more deaths and more wretchedness as they became freely obtainable without the stigma of breaking the law.Sensible people would for the most part avoid them out of fear of addiction, but the feckless and the susceptible — and doubtless some young people in an experimental phase — would be drawn to them in greater numbers.The MPs\u0027 Health and Social Care Committee might retort that it is not recommending full legalisation — at least not yet. But I repeat my contention that the decriminalisation of possession would probably lead in due course to full legalisation.Members of the Committee would also do well to take a closer look at Portugal, where strictly speaking all drugs, other than alcohol and tobacco, remain illegal. If you are found with illicit drugs in that country, whether hard or soft, you are meant to be arrested and taken to a police station. If the amount is above a certain threshold, you should be charged, and can be sent to prison.Should the amount of drugs be small, you are supposed to be sent to the Commission for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction, and interviewed by a psychologist or social worker before appearing in front of a three-person panel which will offer suggestions aimed at stopping your drug use.All in all, this regime seems in many respects tougher than the lax one we have here. I can\u0027t imagine an average cannabis or cocaine user in Britain relishing being examined by a panel.No doubt improved care of addicts in this country would be a step forward so long as it was not accompanied by a green light approving their use of a banned substance.I don\u0027t suppose the recommendations of a lone Commons Committee will be taken all that seriously. But they are undoubtedly part of a growing campaign to legalise not just so-called soft drugs but hard ones, too.Let the police and courts better apply the laws we already have. It\u0027s not going to be easy, of course. But that\u0027s no reason for not attempting it. The unfettered availability of dangerous drugs would be a social nightmare."},{"url":null,"title":"SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE reveals Queens tricky guest list Nato celebrations","story":"Share this article Deploying his unique approach to international diplomacy, \u0027The Donald\u0027 wrote: \u0027Let\u0027s work out a good deal! \u0027You don\u0027t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u0027t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy — and I will. \u0027History will look upon you favourably if you get this done the right and humane way.                President Donald Trump will be among the leaders of all 29 member countries alongside his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u0027It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u0027t happen.\u0027Regrettably, Trump\u0027s missive failed to find favour with Erdogan, who reportedly \u0027received the letter, thoroughly rejected it and put it in the bin\u0027.More or less simultaneously, he launched an assault on northern Syria, prompting Trump to send U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Turkey to broker a ceasefire.Neither the U.S. or Turkish embassies in London would comment on the forthcoming soiree at the palace where, this summer, the Queen hosted a state banquet for Trump.Doubtless HM has already identified the common ground between the two men: both are devout teetotallers.

More than 1.4 million had paid money to open unregulated loot boxes, embedded in popular computer games such as Fortnite or FIFA.         A significant proportion – almost 100,000 children – had gambled online, three times more than the previous yearThe Lord Bishop of St Albans, Alan Smith, said the figures showed that ‘tens of thousands of families could be living in a nightmare’.He added: ‘When the average spend on gambling by children is £17 per week, it is evidence of potential serious family finance problems. A civilised, modern society must not accept this crisis as normal or become content with it.’Lord Chadlington, former chairman of Action On Addiction, said: ‘This reinforces the need for further independent research on gambling-related harm.’ Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who wants to bring in a new Gambling Act, said: ‘Levels of problem gambling among children remain stubbornly high.‘One child gambling addict is too many, let alone 55,000, and these figures show one in ten children is gambling every week. The Government’s soft-touch approach to gambling regulation has failed.’The Mail has campaigned for tighter gambling regulations for many years.The industry regulator’s report was based on an Ipsos Mori survey of 2,950 11 to 16-year-olds, between February and June.The survey asked if children had used gambling to escape problems in their daily lives, if they had stolen money to gamble or if they had chased losses. Boys are about three times more likely to develop a gambling problem than girls, the data showed.But although problem gambling remains high, the number of children gambling regularly is falling. In 2015, 17 per cent were gambling regularly, whereas this year the number is 11 per cent.Gambling Commission executive director Tim Miller said: ‘Any child or young person that experiences harm from these areas is a concern to us and we are absolutely committed to doing everything we can to protect them from gambling harms.‘Where operators have failed to protect children and young people, we have and will continue to take firm action.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Sew Bayeux Tapestry WASNT meant us","story":"Share this article But new analysis of the linen strips on which it is embroidered suggests that it was intended to hang there from the moment it was made.The discovery proves that the designer must have visited Bayeux and known the nave’s exact dimensions, adjusting the design accordingly.The findings shed new light on how the artwork, depicting one of history’s most famous legends, should be displayed ahead of its loan to the UK.

(The exception, in which she looks straight at the camera as if suddenly alert to its presence, appears like an almost accusatory jolt in the middle of the sequence.) There is no accompanying text, but the portraits speak quietly and heartbreakingly of intimate but universal subjects: unconditional love, familial duty and tenderness, the slow, inexorable passing of time, the silence that falls on and around the very old.“My mother was 88 when I started the series and she is 90 now,” says Graham, who is 63. “I suppose I wanted to somehow create an extended portrait of her in old age, a clear-eyed look at her and her last years on Earth. For myself, but also for my family. I have a young son now, and with that came the realisation of what it really means to look after a child. Plus, you find yourself reflecting on your own memories of being looked after as a child. It’s the continuity of a line.”What, though, prompted him to make a book of the images, to put them out in the world rather than keep them in the family? “It wasn’t a difficult decision to make,” he says. “I asked my mum, of course, and she agreed, though to be honest, she would bless anything I do. And I trusted in my instinct. There is nothing embarrassing or undignified in the portraits. There are no fancy camera angles. I kept everything constant: the same chair, the same daylight through the window. The only things that change are her cardigans and tops. For me, it was a very conscious and contemplative process.”The end result bears that out. Mother is, one one level, an exploration of old age as a kind of hinterland, a suspended state in which the world shrinks to the size of a room and consciousness fragments. Throughout, Graham’s patient, painterly approach demands and repays attentiveness, and one’s eye is drawn inevitably to small details: how the camera’s focus shifts almost imperceptibly from portrait to portrait, highlighting the lines on his mother’s face or the silvery grey of her hair.There is nothing obtrusive, just light falling gently on a sleeping face and on the soft pinks and violets of a floral blouse. I have long been fascinated by the idea of quiet photographs, but here the silence is almost Beckettian. “I would sit there for hours,” says Graham, “listening to the ticking of the clock, the wind blowing outside, very aware of time passing. I knew I had to find some way of conveying the stretching and unravelling of time as I experienced it in that room.”Graham has always been an artist concerned with the otherness of the everyday. This may, in part, be a reaction to his teenage years, which were spent amid the precisely ordered conformity of Harlow new town in Essex. An entirely self-taught photographer, his early books, such as A1 – the Great North Road (1983) and Beyond Caring (1986), gave the impression that he belonged to a still unfolding tradition of British social documentary as practised by the likes of Chris Killip and Graham Smith. The first clue that this was not the case came with 1994’s Ceasefire, a photo-book about Northern Ireland published the same year as the IRA’s actual ceasefire. It comprised images of the sky over Ballymurphy, the Bogside and various other neighbourhoods associated with the Troubles.American Night followed in 2003, some of its photographs printed to look almost opaque, a visual metaphor, he said at the time, for the disorientation he felt when working in the dazzling sunlight of the American south. Since then, the critically acclaimed and multi-volumed book, A Shimmer of Possibility (2007), and 2014’s Does Yellow Run Forever? – images of rainbows in the west of Ireland, his partner sleeping, and American gold stores – have continued Graham’s singular exploration of what he calls “elusive and nebulous subject matter”.In 2001, he told me: “The photography I most respect pulls something out of the ether of nothingness.” With Mother, he set himself a similar but different challenge: to evoke his mother’s presence when that presence was becoming ever more elusive. Encroaching mortality may be the subtext, but the tenderness of Graham’s gaze betokens something else: the weight of love and loss conveyed through the act of deep looking. Mother is, unavoidably, an elegiac book, but also a quietly accepting, even affirmative one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5010bf36815e28900ef773ca2262503c126bca5c/0_91_3749_2249/master/3749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82c64af5948f65c3fea80f80cc178373","title":"rihanna mobbed by french fans dennis leupold best photograph","story":"‘A huge crowd surrounded the car. It was quite eerie, almost scary. Even for her that moment was crazy’Rihanna’s French fans are wild. They love her so much and they run for several blocks behind her car when she’s travelling through the city. This shot was taken at Paris fashion week in 2014. It was the first day she arrived in Paris and so things were especially intense.We’d just left the Balmain show and it was really hard to get through this huge crowd of people to the car. When we got inside we were instantly surrounded by people. If you look closely, one of the fans outside has their phone set to record mode – I don’t think you can actually see anything through the glass but they’re still trying. It was quite eerie, almost a little scary. Rihanna is more used to these kinds of situations than other people, but even for her that moment was kind of crazy.Before I met Rihanna I was fascinated by her as a pop star and as a person. She seemed very bold, very authentic and very fun. Before the Diamonds world tour in 2013 she asked me to come along and capture what happens between concerts. We got along well, so we kept working together. She already had a book in mind when we met, and that’s what we’ve spent the last six years doing. This shot was one of the key images for it. She didn’t want it to feature anything posed or set up – she wanted it to capture her life out of her eyes. So even on red carpets with a lot of paparazzi I would have to try to find a fresh angle – maybe include the photographers in the shot, or show a different perspective.Obviously, as a photographer, Rihanna is the best subject you can ask for. She’s very comfortable in front of the camera. The key thing was building a relationship with her. I can kind of feel her mood to know when it’s the right time to shoot, and what kind of pictures she would like. You don’t want to interrupt her workflow. She’s so dedicated to the cause, whatever she does: make up, music, styling. She will not ever do anything she doesn’t believe in. She works crazy hours. It’s awesome to witness.When you spend 24 hours a day with someone – on a jet, on a bus – you become very close. But it was always important that I knew my assignments and remained professional. I would go to an after party with her but maybe go home at 2am and start editing pictures.Rihanna’s very aware of the people around her and she helps them grow with her. Working with her has helped my career in every way. I’ve got to shoot people you would normally never get to shoot. I’ve got pictures of Rihanna and Karl Lagerfeld together – the access has been incredible. It’s also presented me with lots of challenges. When you’re shooting in a studio you get to dictate everything that’s going to happen on your set. But on tour, when you’re taking a picture at 4am with no light and you can’t use a flash, the situation dictates what sort of photo you can take. It really challenges you to get a good picture.Luckily, there is a trust between us. I think she felt OK to show a side to her that she might not show to other people or photographers.• Rihanna is published by Phaidon, £120.Training: I learned myself, from working with all kinds of amazing photographers.Influences: “Peter Lindbergh is the main one – he grew up in the same town and was always the person I look up to.”Low point: “When I started in 2007 there was a recession in the US.

No one has done that. It isn’t in one spot. To the extent that it exists, it’s spread out. You need to approach Shakespeare in order to understand what it might have been like.”Kells is by no means the first person to have embark on a quest to find Shakespeare’s library during the last 400 years. As he writes, “for every species of book person, the idea of Shakespeare’s library – his personal collection of manuscripts, books, letters and other papers – is enticing, totemic, a subject of wonder”. Because “Shakespeare certainly did have books, and he certainly read them. Why, then, have we found none of his manuscripts, and why are there no books with an authentic Shakespeare signature, bookplate, book label or inscription?”He believes that, when Shakespeare died in 1616, “some of the library was probably scattered”. The will of the Renaissance actor Nicholas Tooley asked his executor to “have a care to put off and sell my books to the most profit that he can”, and Kells suspects this is what happened to Shakespeare’s books. Those not sold on his death, or destroyed or lost, “are sitting quietly, in cabinets and on shelves, in public and private collections around the world”, he speculates.“There are things out there still being found and that’s part of the fun. The people who did the initial searching were not very thorough, so there are wonderful things still to be found,” he says. “I think they are around the world. People are still finding chests of early letters, and there are volumes of multiple plays all bound together. Play scripts were thought of as low literature for some time – they were slightly disreputable and weren’t taken seriously. Some of 18th and 19th-century catalogues would only say, ‘here’s a bundle of play scripts.’”One of his tantalising findings is the potential former owner of a theologicial work by Agostino Tornielli. The book was published in Milan in 1610 and shipped to England, where it was bound in brown calfskin in 1615, the year before Shakespeare’s death. The cover panels on the book include an image of Pyramus and Thisbe, and the edges of the text block are decorated with elaborate patterning.“The owner of the four bindings is not known, but there are a few hints. Do the fleurons signify a literary career? That would fit the depiction of Pyramus and Thisbe, which suggests a deep interest in literature (the owner chose a literary motif over a royal, ecclesiastical, political or military one) and possibly a deep interest in Shakespearean literature,” writes Kells. “In tiny letters, the cover image is signed ‘I. S.’ No one knows whether the initials are those of the block-maker, the bookbinder, the bookseller, the book’s owner, a patron or a dedicatee. No one has stepped forward to claim them.”But the initials match those of Iohannes Shakespeare, William’s father, who dealt in leather hides – “no doubt some of them for bookbinding”, Kells writes.Kells believes that one of the reasons for the disappearance of Shakespeare’s library is that the playwright was not an “avid inscriber of books”, or much of a letter writer. “Practically minded and commercial, he does not seem to have been driven by abstract ideas of fame and posterity,” Kells writes.“In thinking about Shakespeare differently, as less of a literary person and more as a workaday person, it makes you think about the library in a different way. It doesn’t have lots of florid descriptions and ownership marks because he wasn’t that kind of a figure,” he says. “Not only was he on the fringes of what was respectable, he in some ways wasn’t taken seriously by literary people … To the extent he had a library, he wasn’t engaging with other people through inscriptions, and he didn’t take his fame very seriously. That’s one reason why potentially some of the key documents aren’t available.”As for Kells, he says: “I couldn’t stop looking for the library if I wanted to.”“I’m quietly confident things are going to turn up,” he says. “We now see the quarto editions as some of the greatest literary treasures in the world but, up until the 19th century, they were thought of in a different way. They are slight documents, little pamphlets, so it’s very probable they’re out there. We now have clearer eyes to search for these things and different ways of analysing them and dating things. We’re in a golden era of discovery right now.”• Shakespeare’s Library: Unlocking the Greatest Mystery in Literature by Stuart Kells is published by Text Publishing (£12.99)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/570cdf3e5131cc65dc9053f9a972119e76b5d8f9/0_230_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18749f7719517079f969f82873faa5e1","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.We begin with a “surprise” for CCCubbon, who has become “quite addicted” to The House on the Strand by Daphne du Maurier:At first I was scoffing mentally at the notion that a drug could induce time travel to the 14th century but the story has drawn me in and I find myself addicted to the addiction of Richard who cannot resist returning again and again, getting irritated by his wife’s presence, caught between two worlds. It is noteworthy the way du Maurier tells of how the landscape changes over the centuries, how Richard searches to marry up the places of then and his time – and yes, there is a map.“Just finished Leonard and Hungry Paul by Ronan Hession,” says pinstripedflower, and “loved it”:It’s a rather gentle tale of two friends who haven’t quite fully embraced life, and how they get on without being ‘complete’. I have to say I probably most resonated with Hungry Paul’s takedown of his sister Grace on her need for ‘busyness’ and it made me think about my always being rushing around! Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice, uncomplicated but well-written novel.Kerr was a wonderful writer. She had such a clear voice when she wrote! The artist’s eye is there and she doesn’t lose the perspective of the young girl even as she writes as an older, more mature, more experienced woman.Tim O’Brien’s magnificent The Things They Carried has worked its dark magic on Larts:I thought it was frightening, awesome, touching, shocking. It’s a well-written book - is it fiction? Memoir? Well he keeps telling you that it’s often made up but then tells you that it’s true. None of that bothered me particularly. The whole thing struck me as authentic and honest. Wonderful, if difficult, read.Invisible Women by Caroline Criado-Perez has been convincing for daveportivo:I thought it was a fascinating read and a powerful argument for collecting sex-disaggregated data. I knew much of it already, but the medical research chapter was particularly disturbing. I’d read about the effects of the “average human” in terms of pollution before (there are some tragic stories), but hadn’t really considered the implications of that concept (or a lack of rigorous, multi-phase testing on women) in terms of basic medicine and diagnosis ... But in many ways that proves her point, even when I was aware of a problem in the way we measured something, I didn’t think: “Hang on, I wonder if they are doing this in other areas”.JayZed has been making good progress through Proust’s In Search of Lost Time:I finished In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower last week (Penguin translation by James Grieve). I mentioned before that there were parts of Swann’s Way that I found a bit of a slog (and other parts that I loved). About half-way through volume two, however - on the way to Balbec - I suddenly got it. I understand now why people become immersed in and obsessed with Proust, and I’m looking forward to the rest of it.“James Meek’s To Calais, In Ordinary Time is easily my new novel of 2019,” writes allworthy:A group of archers are making for Calais when the Plague hits. It’s 1348. The novel is written in three styles or registers from people of different stations. It’s not quite as wide as The Canterbury Tales but you get a good mix and Meek deftly inserts strong women into the story. It’s real achievement is the language. The book is easy to read but contains many words, phrases and cadences which feel right for the period and which gives the book great energy and a realism. The characters are complex, even the minor ones. They are often wrestling with an upside down world that they struggle to understand. It’s not all doom and gloom either. Some of it is very funny but a moving, well-paced novel that never slacks. Really recommended.Finally, interwar has been reading The Red House Mystery by AA Milne:A thoroughly silly plot, characters all sound the same (except the comically rendered servants), dead guy lying there and everyone standing around coolly discussing the pros and cons of whether their country-house host did it. Yes, it’s just what the doctor ordered (or should have)! Puts the brain on hold for an hour or two, escaping far from Brexit.Sounds like a useful one!If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

By 6am the surfers have arrived, followed by the runners and their dogs, then executives-cum-cyclists, speed walkers and yoga instructors. By 7am the cafes are open for breakfast and children, on holiday from inland schools, are already in the water.Where fellow oceanside metropolis Cape Town has marketed itself to the world, Durban has positioned itself as South Africa’s playground. Beachfront theme parks and twirling public waterslides attract families from around the country, and all walks of life. This accessibility and affordability have made this eight-kilometre strip arguably one of South Africa’s most inclusive public spaces.Beyond the narrow strip of beach and promenade, though, South Africa’s third largest city struggles with the same problems as the rest of the country: 25 years after the fall of apartheid the city which was ided by race remains ided by economics.But it is setting out to address those issues with several new models of growth – the waterfront, a privately funded development of restaurants and retail along Florida Road, and the redesign of the traditional market at Warwick Triangle.Each embodies a different theory of how Durban can best become a more inclusive city – and each has its defenders and detractors.“Clearly the beach in Durban was seen as the playground for white South Africans,” says former city manager Michael Sutcliffe. As a member of the United Democratic Front, Sutcliffe led protests to integrate Durban’s beaches in the late 1980s.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa\u0027s cities remain hugely ided, both economically and racially.

Prime real estate overlooking the port was abandoned and illegally occupied, the city’s pastel-coloured art-deco buildings became derelict as landlords neglected them and bylaws were trampled on. The beach, particularly popular South Beach, became a crime hotspot and few dared to be caught there before sunrise or after dark.The real turnaround came in the run-up to the 2010 World Cup, when as a host city Durban had to rethink its image. Along with the repaved promenade and formalised flea markets, came the Moses Mabhida stadium, within walking distance of the beachfront.Durban officials were accused of exacerbating inequality by prioritising entertainment over basic necessities like running water and safe housing in the townships miles away from the tourist hotspots. Still, despite being briefly embroiled in a spending scandal and with a “Mike-is-right” style of leadership that antagonised some fellow councillors, Sutcliffe is credited with revitalising the promenade.Except for one sign that eluded post-apartheid painters, Durban’s beachfront now resembles an idyllic melting pot of South African cultures. On Christmas Day and New Year’s Day, in particular, the beach is so crowded with people who a generation ago were not allowed on the sand that it could be read as an annual defiance to the country’s old laws.The project is still ongoing. A decade ago, the Point Road area near Durban’s docks was known for derelict buildings and illegal prostitution. Now, artists impressions of what the area could look like in the next 10 years imagine glistening skyscrapers reflecting the Indian Ocean, alongside a mixed development of luxury apartments, retail, business zones and tourist hotspots.The development will link the promenade to the port, extending the Golden Mile into a project that hopes to rival Cape Town’s V\u0026ampA Waterfront. A joint venture between the eThekwini Municipality and Malaysian developers UEM Sunrise, the project is reported to cost R35bn (£1.8bn) and will be overseen by the national government, in part to avoid corruption scandals that have overshadowed Durban.As a model for inclusivity, it has one major downside: the beaches along the northern suburbs are now an enclave for middle class and wealthier Durbanites, particularly moneyed black tourists who prefer the warmer Indian Ocean to Cape Town’s icy Atlantic. What’s more, despite its plans for mixed-income development, the new Point Road project looks likely to exclude the largely black, working class communities who have kept Durban’s city centre alive.A second approach is taking place at what is arguably Durban’s most successful regeneration project, Florida Road, a trendy thoroughfare just over a mile from the beachfront. A project by London-based developer Urban Lime hopes tourists and especially locals will linger in the courtyards that mix the Victorian and Edwardian facades of this historic neighbourhood with trendy boutiques and restaurants of the so-called new South Africa.Previously a street of churches, retirement homes and an unassuming supermarket, the Florida Road turnaround began when Urban Lime bought a parking lot, and transformed it into a retail and outdoor entertainment space. Unusual in a city traumatised by crime, the strip is designed to encourage walking, and by day a row of dessert spots welcome a family-conscious community, many of them devout Muslims. It offers mixed price options: a taco spot and Afro’s Chicken Shop, a local favourite, are affordable easy dining, with more fine-dining restaurants further along the street.The developer works with local residents’ associations to employ a private security company that patrols the privately owned public spaces, and Urban Lime has expanded aggressively, accumulating around 200,000 sq m of retail space since 2014 and spending R1.2bn.Recognising the inner-city’s cash-driven economy, Urban Lime has moved into the city centre, where it has subided retail space to allow small traders to rent for as little as R1,500 a month for several square metres. They’ve taken over the iconic Durban Club Chambers, a downtown high-rise that houses the city’s legal fraternity and was once the offices of one of the country’s first black lawyers and founding member of the ANC Pixley ka Isaka Seme. They plan to turn part of the block into a pedestrian zone in an attempt to coax the advocates who work in the city to spend more time in central Durban.The company’s managing director, Nad Shahid, explains a grand plan of 16 nodes that will reconnect the suburbs to the inner-city and eventually back to the beach. Centred on a refurbished building or district, these nodes revitalise the area block by block with small to medium-sized retail, restaurants and office space, bringing traffic back to abandoned spaces and helping Durban combine the commercial drive of Johannesburg with the oceanside lifestyle of Cape Town.“It has potential to be a huge business city and it also has the potential to be a huge lifestyle-stroke-tourist city as well,” says Urban Lime CEO Jonny Friedman. “But the city needs to do things. In my opinion it’s the psychological and physical links between north and south.”But, this sort of development is also synonymous with gentrification around the world. On Florida Road, it has meant higher rents and some angry tenants, most notably the owner of the restaurant Spiga, Marco Santoniccolo, who closed down his family eatery after nearly 17 years on Florida Road after rents climbed. Since reopening around the corner on Innes road, though, Santoniccolo has made peace with the changes and even welcomes the developments.Durban city centre may have been abandoned by some landlords and starved of services in the 1990s and 2000s but is neither a ghost town nor a crime-ridden chaos. It is home to many working-class black South Africans who have moved from townships and villages around the province of KwaZulu-Natal.Built over a transit hub that links minibus taxis and trains, Warwick Market offers everything from fresh vegetables to dried medicinal herbs. Among rows of wild spinach and sweet potatoes is a butchery that sells fresh offal and fish. There are stalls specialising in the uniform of the Zionist Christian Church, and others that will type a CV for R7. One sells DVDs of popular mbaqanga music artists a herbalist offers a mixture that will “help you find love”.It represents a third option: a more natural, bottom-up development that embraces all Durbanites, not just those who can afford to eat in the fancier restaurants of Florida Road or tourists paying for expensive beachfront hotels. The market largely caters to the residents who were willing to put up with Durban’s inner-city decay because they had no better option.Warwick market’s survival is testament to a moment of euphoria in post-apartheid South Africa in which officials, corporates and informal traders were willing to reconfigure the segregated city in the 1990s, explains Richard Dobson of Asiye eTafuleni (meaning ‘let’s go to the table’), a non-profit that represents the voices of informal traders in urban planning.This model was put to the test during Durban’s revamp as a so-called “world class city” fit for the World Cup, when the historic market faced demolition to make space for a shopping mall. It was ultimately saved by mass demonstrations, when thousands of vendors rallied together, forcing the city to rethink its development plan and improve the junction for people who already lived there.Dobson says the market functions well, with a turnover in the order of millions of pounds. It is vendors who keep the area safe and clean, not police or city workers.In many ways Warwick represents the kind of community buy-in and local participation that is only now beginning to occur on the beachfront, and has yet to occur in the city that lies right behind it. So, will Durban ever become a fully inclusive city?“You don’t do it by thinking that by putting black people living next to white people suddenly the white people are going to change,” says Sutcliffe, the former city manager. “That’s not going to happen. And it hasn’t happened. I think that all the evidence shows that kind of integration will take generations.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter.

And the British women we spoke to are indulging themselves, guilt-freeI’d be lying if I said I’d been looking forward to my 40s. Before the big birthday rolled around, I’d defined this decade as old. Boring. I was wrong. Speaking to other fortysomething women, I realised this is the time to forget about guilty pleasures. Here, we’re celebrating all out, straight-up pleasures. Some are everyday. Some are extravagant. They share one important theme: experiences over things equals enjoyment.‘I treated myself to a bike that’s turned me superhuman’Sarah Emslie, 41, osteopath, EdinburghI caught myself saying “I’m having a midlife crisis” to the guy in the bike shop and I kicked myself, because it’s nonsense. If I want to blow four figures on a super-fast aerodynamic time trial bike then I should celebrate. We don’t need to apologise for having fun. Racing head down, number on my back, I feel superhuman. I love how clear my head feels speeding downhill at 60km an hour. My favourite moments are when my wife, Laura, rides ahead of me, so I can take in the view of the mountains with her zooming down. I’m faster over the course than I was last year. It’s exhilarating to be 41 and still get better at your sport. I don’t feel my age. I don’t feel anything except that I’m me.‘I just enjoy being in a creative space’Helena Smith, 41, psychologist, KentThere are many hoops to jump through to get out of the house, especially because I’m a single mum, but my Tuesday life drawing class is worth it. I don’t give two monkeys about being good at sketching I just enjoy being in a creative space where I don’t think about work or bills or the stress of being a working mum because I’m so in the moment. Taking time out forces you into a different mindset. It’s been years since I did anything creative like this, because when you have babies it’s nearly impossible to do anything for yourself. During the two-hour class, time disappears completely. It’s my ultimate indulgence, because it’s purely for myself – nobody else’s benefit.‘Reading all morning is my ultimate indulgence’Minhe Currier, 41, stay-at-home mum, SurreyIf I don’t get time to myself I just don’t function. It’s not even an indulgence, it’s a sanity issue. As a married mother of a six-year-old, I automatically put myself last. But after the school drop-off, I open a book and read. In my 20s and 30s all I did was work. I was a broker in the city, starting work at 6.30am, leaving at 7pm and coming home without the emotional energy to read anything at all. Now I’m really into non-fiction because I’ve discovered life is much stranger than anything an author can make up. Recently I’ve read Harriet Harman’s autobiography, A Woman’s Work, which I think is good enough to rival Michelle Obama’s Becoming. Harman was a big childcare campaigner and reinforced the idea that parents are better people when they have their own lives. I couldn’t agree more.‘I get excited about an early night’Rhiannon Evans, 48, surveyor, CardiffI’m happier after a big sleep, and my skin looks happier, too. I get excited about an early night. I crave sleep and dream about my duvet during a rough day at work. I’m in bed by 10pm and I fall asleep quickly, often while I’m reading, but perimenopausal hormonal mayhem means I’m often awake for two or three hours in the middle of the night. It doesn’t help that my kids, aged 18 and 21, keep totally different hours to mine. At the weekend I might sleep until 10am, which is bliss.‘I never thought high street pasta could feel so extravagant’Zohreh Ghaffari, 48, radiographer, LondonIs it boring that my ultimate indulgence is eating pasta alle vongole until I can’t breathe? Add a nice glass of wine and finish up with chocolate and I’m a happy woman. In my 20s I ate out a lot without really thinking about it. Now going out for dinner is a mission: we need to book a babysitter and there are lots of stars that have to align workwise, because my husband and I both do shifts in different hospitals. But because we eat out so rarely, it feels special when we do. Sometimes we even have a random day off midweek together, so we treat ourselves and go for pasta on the high street while the kids are at school. That feels like a real indulgence.Beauty is ageless.

First, they all have good things going for them they would be really pleasant places to live if you could find a way to earn a living. Second, attractive as they are, I fear they were in better shape a couple of generations ago. And third, I wonder what the future holds for them.What I have really wanted to do is knock on the doors of sixth-form colleges, get the 17- and 18-year-olds together, and ask which of them is planning to make their lives in their home towns. Then I would ask those who wanted to be somewhere else why this was, and what it would take to get them to change their minds. These are really important questions, at the heart of inclusion, identity and opportunity. If answers aren’t found, our smaller places will risk withering on the vine, and our bigger places will get bigger and bigger, with all the ghastly consequences – air pollution, soaring house prices and so on. Look no further than the absurdly skyscraping skyline of Manchester now under construction. What are we thinking? For heaven’s sake, let’s just spread life around a bit more.The above list finishes with Weymouth, and not just because it is in alphabetical order. It was Weymouth that got me thinking this way. Last year, I was having my picture taken by an impressive woman working for this newspaper who had grown up there. She was in her 20s and living in north London. I asked her if she had ever considered making her life back home.“What would I do in Weymouth?” she shrugged.I get that – I left the West Midlands when I was 19, after all – but why does it have to be like this? What needs to happen for there to be jobs near these places, or ones that are easier to get to if they are not so near?I have pitched the idea to every media organisation that will take my call. Working title, WTF Would I Do in Weymouth? But none of this is new, of course, and plenty of research has been done looking at how to reverse the endless march towards the metropolis. The solutions are obvious, starting with much better transport, especially public transport, and better broadband. Both of these require massive public spending, with electoral reward starting to pop its head up only in three parliaments’ time at the earliest, I would have thought. So we can probably dream on.NB: Regarding the places I have mentioned, I expect I will get furious communications along the lines of: “How dare you? This town is thriving!” All I can say is: bring it on. Honestly, I’d love to be wrong.• Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0f8385e421753efcece36d2c66a6785a9bc921/0_127_4612_2767/master/4612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71500187cb82888907dbe4bc03baa38e","title":"guardian editors climate emergency pledge","story":"Editors from across the  explain how they are putting the climate emergency front and centreThe climate crisis is a story that reaches every corner of the world and on the international news desk our team of correspondents report on it from around the globe.For many readers, it is something they experience to varying degrees of intensity at first hand – a hotter summer, an earlier spring, floods in autumn – but by linking up those experiences, we are able to show how interconnected this crisis is.In the past few months we have covered stories ranging from the record-breaking European heatwave, where temperatures of over 45C were recorded in France for the first time, a heatwave and drought in India, where thousands abandoned their homes, and the unprecedented Arctic wildfires that could be seen from space.Such events are not just “weather”, however, and we follow their impact: the buckling European road and rail infrastructure not suitable for the new climate era, the desperate search for water in Chennai and the Greenland residents traumatised by the climate emergency as life becomes more precarious and social problems such as alcoholism intensify.In Italy, the Planpincieux glacier in the Mont Blanc massif is changing so rapidly that avalanches and debris falls have led to deaths and evacuations, leaving residents in the town of Courmayeur fearing how much longer it will hold.Our reporters have also travelled to where governments and iniduals are making it worse. Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a 2,000km journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation.There are also those attempting to make it better. On 1 September 2018 we published an interview from Stockholm with a 15-year-old who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden’s hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg’s solo protest has since become a global movement.Climate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. “I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,” subsistence farmer Esteban Gutiérrez told reporter Nina Lakhani.Business and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world – and are key to meeting the Paris agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.From giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers – all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment.These are huge questions, and  readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like.Our economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth – which does not pursue profit at all costs – must come.We are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives – and alerting readers to those who fall short.Writing in the  earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France – Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau – underlined the importance of change. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said.Without action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year’s Californian wildfires, for instance – the worst in the state’s history – cost insurers more than $12bn. Banks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become “stranded assets”. The Bank of England has warned that as much as $20tn of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed.Many companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L’Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress.We are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year, and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer.Our reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting 100,000 electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK.Most corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines – like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next 20 years.Investment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal \u0026amp General, Europe’s second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year: “The effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients’ assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.”However, not every investment group is using its muscle – and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager, with $6tn under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock’s job is to make a profit for investors. He added: “Our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter.”They do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting.Fashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the mostimportant issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage.We aren’t perfect and we don’t pretend to have all the answers. Wewill continue to listen to a wide range of voices – our readersparamount amongst those – to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion – in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background.We have always championed ethical fashion brands, but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn’t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic – but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet.What does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintagepieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe, and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it.None of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion – and about the future of our planet, too.There’s an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it’s clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have.Meat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public’s focus. There are many reasons why veganism – or at least flexitarianism – is growing fast and sustainability is one of them.It’s important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, ided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together – families, friends, communities and strangers – and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It’s also a time when it’s difficult to know who to believe and to trust. I hope people can be sure of the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe269d9ec06740a551d25fa8d8e07c902892cd2/0_260_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d6b0d86d0b03a66ff9f5ee4bdec8e2","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 images pictures guidelines","story":" picture editor Fiona Shields explains why we are going to be using fewer polar bears and more people to illustrate our coverage of the climate emergency At the  we want to ensure that the images we publish accurately and appropriately convey the climate crisis that we face. Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9590ba3c1f3793baaf3d52ba2fdb71a505061fb/0_478_4170_2503/master/4170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c801d07fff508b53814f8c68fe53c58","title":"snorkelling grandmothers uncover large population of venomous sea snakes in noumea","story":"Women’s photography of greater sea snake, once believed to be an anomaly in the Baie des Citrons, help scientists understand the ecosystem A group of snorkelling grandmothers who swim up to 3km five days a week have uncovered a large population of venomous sea snakes in a bay in Noumea where scientists once believed they were rare.Claire Goiran from the University of New Caledonia and Professor Rick Shine from Australia’s Macquarie University were studying a small harmless species known as the turtle‐headed sea snake located in the Baie des Citrons, but would occasionally encounter the 1.5 metre-long venomous greater sea snake, also known as the olive-headed sea snake.Goiran and Shine believed the greater sea snake was an anomaly in the popular swimming bay as it had only been spotted about six times over 15 years. From 2013, they decided to take a closer look at the greater sea snake to better understand its importance to the bay’s ecosystem.“The study zone is in the most touristic bay in Noumea, so I often meet people when I am doing field work on sea snakes,” Goiran said. “When I was snorkelling on my own studying sea snakes, I used to meet a friend of mine called Aline that was snorkelling and taking photos on the same reef. In order to help me, she started taking photos of sea snakes and would send them to me by mail.“I was very happy, so she asked her neighbour and friend Monique to help me too. Monique asked another friend, and soon there were seven grandmothers helping me.” The group named themselves “the fantastic grandmothers” and range in age from 60 to 75.As the grandmothers sent photos through to Goiran and Shine, they realised they had vastly underestimated the population of greater sea snakes. Goiran and Shine have now published a paper in the journal Ecosphere revealing there are more than 250 greater sea snakes in the bay. Greater sea snakes have distinctive markings, allowing iniduals to be easily identified from photographs.“Even when I am stuck at university with teaching, I know what is going on in the study zone because the grandmas survey the zone for me and send me the photos,” Goiran said.“Remarkably,” Shine added, “the grandmothers found a large number of lethally toxic sea snakes in a small bay that is occupied every day by hordes of local residents and cruise‐ship passengers – yet no bites by the species have ever been recorded at Baie des Citrons, testifying to their benevolent disposition.”They said the findings mean the role the snakes play in the functioning of the ecosystem is more important than previously thought. Scientists believe the snakes likely play a role in nutrient cycling through coral reefs, but there is little research available.Would this work have been possible without help from the citizen scientist grandmas?“Of course not,” Goiran said. However it was hard to get all seven in the group going out at the same time, she said, because “there is always at least one away hiking, biking, sailing, taking yoga class or taking care of the grandkids”.One of the grandmothers, Aline Guémas, said she was not scared of the greater sea snakes despite their potential deadly bite. The grandmothers always keep their distance and never touch them. “That’s the job of the boss,” Guémas said.Her job was just to take videos and photos. Other members of the group helped with identifying the snakes and documenting their characteristics. The sea snakes could move quickly, making taking photographs difficult at times. But Guémas said “they are very slow in their movements when they forage for food”, making those times ideal for photography.Her friend in the group, Sylvie Shebert, said she was afraid of the snakes at first but has grown to appreciate them. “It has been interesting to learn about and discover their lifestyle and to work with the group,” she said. “It allows us to integrate our swimming with the scientific world by sharing the results of what we find with the researchers, such as the area where the snake is located, it’s condition such as if it is pregnant or not, that kind of thing.”Monique Mazière said “the snakes are not aggressive, just curious”.“Of course, we will never touch them.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2d067107d8284b646616fee8ed3d84c9f51fc82/717_135_4083_2450/master/4083.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c25bafa74c7a4b720a24f349a252501","title":"wildlife corridors to save borneo elephants in pictures","story":"Deforestation in Malaysia and Indonesia has endangered the Borneo elephant, which depends on forest connectivity to survive, by isolating it from large foraging grounds.

Packed with rambling digressions, sudden shifts of tone, and playful fake-outs as it shuttles between layers of “reality” and performance, but constructed with precision and assurance, it leaves you with both a sugar high and slight sense of nausea.At a former hospital, a film crew gather to shoot a low-budget comedy-drama-horror movie within the low-budget comedy-drama-horror movie that is Chained for Life itself. A director (Charlie Korsmo), who may actually be German or just faking the Werner Herzog accent, has managed to cast Mabel Fairchild (Jess Weixler), a famous actor up for slumming it in this indie effort as the ingenue in a period work about a mad scientist (Stephen Plunkett) and a hospital full of people with unusual physiognomies, including an extremely tall man, folk with severe burns scars, a pair of conjoined twins, and a “bearded” lady.In the film within the film, Mabel’s character is meant to fall in love with Rosenthal (British actor Adam Pearson, who featured in Under the Skin), a character who, like Pearson himself, has the disfiguring disease neurofibromatosis, which was thought to be the condition Joseph Merrick, AKA the Elephant Man, had. Mabel does seem to develop feelings for Rosenthal, although they’re not so easy to define.Schimberg wrongfoots the viewer by presenting scenes with overlapping dialogue that appear to be just the actors talking among themselves but then turn out to be scenes from the film. Before long, dream sequences or perhaps discarded segments interweave and intersect with the upper reality of the story, only to subside again.Throughout, shiny little movie-buff allusions glitter and glint amid the mix, referencing both obvious touchstones, such as Tod Browning’s Freaks and George Franju’s Eyes Without a Face, and deliciously left-field samplings, for example from The Muppet Movie. Cult movie enthusiasts will revel in ticking off the titles, but this surreal story works just fine in its own right.• Chained for Life is released in the UK on 25 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d39257f11a670c5d1a853fff89fc23aee4093b93/70_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5196265b5d60501cae47a84dff317538","title":"saudi womens driving school hbo documentary","story":"Last year, Saudi Arabia lifted its ban on female drivers. A new film follows several women as they take to the road – with surprising and moving resultsAbout halfway through Saudi Women’s Driving School, airing on HBO this week, the film looks as though it could be heading into a commercial break. Scenes in the sprawling, dust-cloaked capital of Riyadh give way to a magnificent desert ringed by sandstone plateaus. A single black Hyundai streaks through, trailing sand like a comet. In a scene worthy of a car ad, a woman, Shahad al-Humaizi, drives through the desert, sunglasses coolly in place.Natural grandeur, woman at the wheel – it’s not an image often associated with Saudi Arabia and one only state-sanctioned since June 2018, when the country’s King Salman formally lifted a decades-long ban on female drivers. But Saudi Women’s Driving School seeks to uncover stories like al-Humaizi’s, which don’t fit neatly into quick news hits, as more and more women take to the road.On a state level, the removal of the female driving ban seems like a rare progressive fluke for a country whose brazen flexes of state control have drawn international outrage five weeks before the ban’s end, the film notes, at least 10 female activists who publicly called for the change were arrested and branded as traitors in the state press. Just months after the ban lifted, the brutal murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a consulate in Istanbul, which a UN report blames on the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, drew widespread condemnation, as has the country’s blockade on neighboring Yemen, spawning one of the worst humanitarian crises of the decade.Still, as Saudi Women’s Driving School demonstrates, on a micro level, the end of the driving ban is no small event for numerous women in the country, offering new opportunities for employment, mobility and passion. “I felt that having only known about Saudi Arabia through a lot of western media reports,” director Erica Gornall told the , “I wanted to go there on the ground and meet these women we’d seen on the news.”Gornall, who has contributed to and directed several documentary projects for BBC2, joined the team behind Saudi Women’s Driving School relatively late in the process, just weeks before they were due to depart for Riyadh. Producers Nick London and Fiona Stourton had secured a rare filming visa based on the narrow focus of their project, a process begun in the weeks after King Salman announced the ban’s end in fall 2017.The crew arrived in Saudi Arabia in mid-October 2018, and filmed on and off for three months. The team was, for the most part, surprisingly left to their own devices, said Gornall, although “at the same time, there were other things that reminded you that film-making was very new, and a thing you have to be careful about.” For example, she accidentally caused a scene by filming alone outside a crowded cafe. “But overall, it was a lot easier to film in Saudi Arabia than I thought it would be.”The central hub of filming was the titular Saudi Women’s Driving School in Riyadh, a looping maze of new drivers and instructors in white cars, and the gateway to certification for aspiring female drivers. Gornall and her crew followed several women at different levels of driving ability. For some, like Sarah Saleh, who works on an auto showroom floor but was not able to drive, a license offered freedom of mobility and the chance to actually drive a product she sells. For women like race-car driver Amjad Alamri and Uber driver al-Humaizi, the ban’s end translated into career opportunities.Alamri, introduced to Gornall through a Saudi member of her film crew, began learning to drive long before the ban’s end now, she’s a striking presence on the racetrack, inspecting her car, willing herself not to get too distracted on the turns. “The ambition after having so many barriers for years and years and being told no this isn’t for you – she is one of those feminists who really is taking the bull by the horns,” said Gornall.Meeting women such as Alamri and al-Humaizi was “quite surprising”, said Gornall. “There was quite a rebellious streak to some of the women we met.”But that rebelliousness bumps into opposition beyond the high walls of the state. Keeping to the film’s small-scale focus, Saudi Women’s Driving School visits the issue of driving, and women’s rights at large, in inidual conversations and family discussions. In one of the most striking scenes of the film, al-Humaizi picks up a random male passenger in her Uber who has never ridden with a female driver before. She broaches the topic of women’s rights casually but firmly, with a smile. Does he support the changes? she asks. He answers confidently yes, to a point he’s not opposed to equality but afraid of what might happen beyond that since “women by nature are emotional”.Al-Humaizi stares straight ahead, then drops him off at his destination. God bless, he says. “I really enjoyed your driving, which I’d been scared of.”The man was one of several anonymous participants Gornall and her crew picked up on street corners to ride in al-Humaizi’s Uber or to discuss their thoughts on the driving ban – footage that was “the most frustrating bunch of interviews I’ve ever had to do in my career to date”, Gornall said.“As a film-maker, you try not to personalize it because it’s not about me,” Gornall said of the Uber scenes in particular. “But it’s incredibly challenging not to because I’m still a woman.” The casual misogyny, stated confidently as simply a matter of course, “made me upset”, said Gornall, “not for me, but for the women like Shahad, like Amjad, who were probably the strongest women I’ve ever met in terms of their determination against everything that’s happened in the past”. To have people underestimate them, she said, was “really frustrating”.Still, the rights of women in Saudi Arabia are significantly limited the documentary notes that at the time of filming, men still maintained so-called ship rights over women, meaning they could not travel without a male relative’s permission. ship was lifted in July 2019, though women must still seek permission for marriage.However, Gornall acknowledged, the reality is that breaking the rules in the autocratic country still often results in severe punishments. Loujain al-Hathloul, who drove before the ban’s end and is shown in the film calling for greater rights for women, is still in prison. The film posits that Saleh’s license, al-Humaizi’s conversations as an Uber driver and Alamri’s fearless presence on the track are all small steps of progress – achievements worth celebrating and perhaps indicative of a more liberated future for Saudi women. “I want to be optimistic for the future of the women I filmed in Saudi,” said Gornall. “But I think it’s hard to see how those seeds will blossom further without bigger changes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5db5a0a77cbcee34caad8463d3810013ddbce60f/0_96_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15738fd3fa47c3c47af6cdf860c657ca","title":"on the road dennis hoppers 60s photography in pictures","story":"The Easy Rider actor-director picked up a camera in 1961 and began a parallel career as a photographer, taking shots on film sets, in diners and out in the landscape, before putting all his pictures in a vault in the early 70s.

More than 8m pumpkins are expected to be binned uneaten this year, acccording to research by stock cube makers Knorr and the food-waste charity Hubbub. That’s more than 18,000 tonnes of edible flesh. Most of us do not even consider pumpkins food.That misunderstanding has been compounded by carving pumpkins occasionally being labelled “for ornamental use only”. But that is changing: Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, for example, do not use such labelling all of their carving pumpkins are edible.It can be hard work to hollow out these thin-walled but robust monsters, discard the toughest fibrous bits, separate the seeds and create something tasty from the watery flesh. But you can make delicious food from even the most unpromising pumpkin. Here are some ideas from chefs, bakers and cookery writers.The wet flesh in bigger pumpkins lends itself to pie fillings. Roast chunks with lots of garlic until caramelised and toss it in a blitzed dressing of sage, lemon zest and oil. Line a bread tin with shortcrust pastry (at home, I use all-butter Jus-Rol) and pack the mix in. After cooking – 45 minutes at 210C (190C fan)410Fgas mark 7 – the filling will still be juicy and the pastry perfect – and you get that mosaic effect of the dressing and its flavours running around the chunks and right through the pie. Calum Franklin, executive chef, Holborn Dining Rooms, LondonHalloween pumpkins can be watery, so once you’ve cooked the flesh, hang it in a colander overnight to get rid of as much liquid as possible. You want intense flavour. These tortelli come from Lombardy and they are basically pumpkin mixed with mostarda (mustard oil and fruit preserve) and parmesan, stuffed into pasta and served with sage butter. It isn’t measured exactly it’s down to taste. Puree the mixture if you like, too. I would recommend people make fresh pasta for this. Roll it out thinly in one long strip, dot your pumpkin mix on, fold it over, seal it, cut it – I use a square shape – and you have lovely tortelli. Angela Hartnett, chef-owner, Murano, LondonWhen you add roasted, liquidised pumpkin to sourdough (200g to 1kg of flour reduce the water slightly), you get a gorgeous loaf. It imparts a natural earthy flavour, as well as making the crumb noticeably softer. And you get a crisper crust. After removing any fibrous material around the seeds, gently dry them in a low oven and roast them with salt and olive oil – you can put them in the bread, too. The key thing to know when adding seeds is that they suck moisture from bread. Immediately after roasting them, pour a little water over the seeds and they will absorb it. You will get all the toasted flavour, but no dry seeds. Aidan Monks, owner-baker, Lovingly Artisan, CumbriaTechnically, because it contains seeds, pumpkin is a fruit – so why not treat it as one? Finely chop the flesh, add a little water and a handful of brown sugar and let it bubble until pulpy. Blitz with a hand blender, put it back on the stove and cook it until it is thick and spitting. Let it cool and thicken and there you go: pumpkin jam. It’s sweet, so stick it on dark rye sourdough. It needs that bitterness. Andrew Dargue, chef-owner, Vanilla Black, LondonLocro de zapallo is a classic Peruvian, originally Andean, dish, usually served with white rice. The quick, easy version is: sauté sliced onions, garlic and red chilli in olive oil, add pumpkin (250g per person, roughly cubed) and vegetable stock, and cook until the pumpkin breaks down but still retains some chunks. To finish, add cooked broad beans, tons of chopped parsley and a dash of cumin. It should be a vibrantly orange, garlicky, thick, sloppy stew, fresh with parsley. This is vegan but, if you want, add cream and crumbled feta. Martin Morales, chef-owner, Ceviche restaurants, LondonIdeally, choose a smaller, sweeter pumpkin for this tasty, simple Valencian dessert. Cover the pumpkin with foil and bake for about an hour at 190C (170C fan)gas mark 5. In a sieve, press out as much water as possible and then mash it until smooth. To make four portions, mix 400g of pumpkin with 50g ground almonds, 60g sugar, one egg yolk, half a teaspoon of cinnamon and lemon zest. Spoon it into inidual ramekins, top with blanched almonds and honey and bake until golden. We serve it with homemade turrón ice cream. Joe Wright, chef-owner, Porta, ChesterA light, vegan hug-in-a-bowl for autumn. Sauté onion, minced garlic and charred sweetcorn with four tablespoons of olive oil. Add a tablespoon of plain or gluten-free flour, followed by cubes of pumpkin – you can use any, from fibrous Halloween types to our favourite acorn squash. Then, adding veg stock slowly, cook until it is just soft. Finish with seasoning, chopped flat-leaf parsley and roasted pumpkin seeds. Samantha Evans, chef-owner, Hang Fire Southern Kitchen, Barry, WalesDry-fried pumpkin seeds – keep them moving in the pan so they don’t burn – are great in adventurous salads. They work especially well as a nutty complement to sweet-sour pops of fresh fruit. One of my favourites is our take on chana chaat. This sees toasted pumpkin seeds, couscous, chickpeas, raisins, a little fresh tomato and pomegranate seeds tossed together, seasoned and drizzled with coriander-mint dressing, made by blitzing fresh coriander, toasted coriander seeds, mint, sugar, pickled chillies, sunflower seeds, turmeric and lime juice. Naved Nasir, executive chef, DishoomThis pre-Hiic Mexican recipe uses pumpkin seeds, with the red coming from charred tomatoes and dried guajillo chilli. Roast 800g of tomatoes, 500g of onions and peeled garlic, turning occasionally. Toast 25g of chillies for about 30 seconds, then soften them in boiling water. In a blender, process all the ingredients and 380g of toasted pumpkin seeds until smooth. Pass the salsa through a strainer, season and serve with the roasted chicken or pumpkin. It’s a kiss of spiciness – but not overpowering. Martha Ortiz, chef-patron, Ella Canta, LondonThis is my take on a pumpkin spiced latte. To make six, put half a tablespoon of coffee granules in 300ml of milk – granules work best to get that proper coffee taste – and heat until infused. Then add 360ml of cooked pumpkin puree, 420ml of double cream, 120ml of caster sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon, mix it together and bring it almost to the boil. Off the heat, add three sheets of pre-soaked bronze leaf gelatine. Whisk thoroughly and sieve it. Pour into moulds and allow six hours to set.

I think we are entitled to be happy with the way we played and it is a bit of a blueprint for us. There are no excuses now to dip from that. It is the standard for us. Hopefully we can get better but we can’t drop that standard at this level of football.“It answers questions because the younger players are still babies in Champions League minutes. This was a huge test for them and football continues to give you tests all the time. So I don’t want to say that they are there or this is it. But there was a balance tonight, with the young players who are learning quickly and the experienced players around them who are there to set examples.”Lampard had words of praise for Pulisic, the £58m summer signing from Borussia Dortmund who has struggled so far to establish himself. “His performance tonight and his last couple of performances off the bench show something – he’s made differences. I’ve basically tried to shut my ears to much of the outside talk. With a big player, there’s a lot said and if you listen to it all the time, you can wonder what you’re doing.“I understood the quality of Christian. I understood his young age and it’s a big move for him to Chelsea. And I have other options for him in those areas. Let’s give him full credit.

Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah created further goals for each other as Liverpool won on the road in the group for the first time since the 7-0 rout of Maribor in October 2017.The scoreline suggests another comfortable European away win. It was anything but. Genk had several chances to punish a porous and often unprotected Liverpool defence in the first half. Liverpool had the class. And class told.“I don’t know about the Champions League missing me but I’ve definitely missed it,” said Oxlade-Chamberlain. “It’s a special tournament to play in. It was great to see the boys do so well last year, being on the bench at the end and watching the boys bring it home. It’s nice to be back in the starting lineup and to get a couple of goals is a bonus but we’ve got to be better if we want to go further in the tournament.”Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Keïta provided the penetration and creativity that Liverpool fans have often called for in midfield in the Champions League as Klopp rewarded both for their influential substitute displays against Manchester United on Sunday with starting roles here. The England international needed all of 111 seconds to repay his manager with the opening goal. His first goal since the Champions League quarter-final first leg defeat of Manchester City in April 2018 followed a poor defensive clearance from the home side. Andy Robertson and Roberto Firmino reacted sharply to keep the pressure on and Oxlade-Chamberlain, given time to pick his spot from almost 25 yards, found the bottom corner with precision. An open, defensively sloppy first half had started. Annoyingly for Klopp, his irritation clear in the technical area, both sides were vulnerable.A lack of solidity and communication may have been understandable in the visitors’ back-line given the absences of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joël Matip through illness and injury respectively. It was still a surprise how easily Liverpool were opened up whenever Genk had possession, and they did not have it often. James Milner was selected ahead of Joe Gomez at right-back with Dejan Lovren replacing Matip in central defence. But gaps appeared across Liverpool’s rearguard.Mbwana Samatta was played clean through moments after Oxlade-Chamberlain’s opener by a simple clearance out of defence. To Liverpool’s relief he dragged a shot horribly wide. Moments later the Genk right-back, Joakim Maehle, sent Paul Onuachu away from Lovren. This time the Genk striker’s shot was on target but Alisson produced a fine one-handed save low to his right. Junya Ito then delivered a dangerous cross to the far post that Samatta converted with an emphatic header as he steamed in above Milner. Genk’s celebrations were cut short by a referee’s assistant’s flag for offside. A lengthy VAR review upheld the decision and Liverpool were reprieved, and again when Samatta just failed to connect with another Ito cross from the right.Liverpool were dominant in possession and went close to extending their advantage when Mané played an exquisite one-two with Firmino, who played his strike partner through with a rabona chip on the edge of the area only for Coucke to save at close range. The Genk goalkeeper also denied Robertson from an angle following a delightful assist from Mané and Salah, back in the starting line-up after an ankle injury, went close with a free-kick.The visitors largely nullified Genk’s threat in the second half and were given the comfort of a two-goal lead when Oxlade-Chamberlain beat Coucke with a magnificent finish. Keïta, an increasingly creative presence in midfield, found Firmino inside the area with a measured chip. The Brazil forward laid the ball back out to the waiting midfielder who clipped it first time over the Genk keeper and in off the underside of the bar. Oxlade-Chamberlain was side-on to goal when he connected. It was the goal of a confident player, a reward for perseverance through horrendous injury, and he departed to a standing ovation from the Liverpool section when replaced by Georginio Wijnaldum.Mané added a third with a deft chip over the on-rushing Coucke when he was released behind the Genk defence by Salah. He returned the favour with a ball to Salah’s feet inside the area, although in truth the fourth was of the Egypt international’s own making as he spun away from his marker before finding the far corner. The Genk substitute Stephen Odey scored a late consolation after Lovren was caught dawdling in possession, to the obvious fury of Alisson. It soon passed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/552c5fcf186be7a30f474985a67f99f71c022609/0_130_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83d192e08d9a3455fe0b021fb1634a2f","title":"life goals how three women made their money work","story":"Putting money aside can be difficult. But with a bit of careful planning, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly thatPutting money aside – whether it’s for short-term goals or major life changes – can be difficult. There’s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started The Gluten Free Blogger alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. “It made it easier knowing I didn’t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,” she says. Sarah’s savings plan was fairly traditional – using an ISA to build savings and putting away a little each month. Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. “I enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,” she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. “As the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.” Her next goal? Finding her dream home.She set up an investment portfolio and chose a lower-risk option. “I have always tended to take guidance and invested my money, I got an insurance policy paid out and it was all invested, for example.” Kay says that it was simple enough to amass the capital she needed to invest, by living a little more modestly. “It’s not the fact that I don’t like spending, but I’m just an ordinary, day-to-day person – I don’t yearn for fancy things,” she says. I’m very content. If I can live like I’m living now from today until tomorrow, I’ll be more than happy.”How to save to travel the world as a volunteerDorothy Selleck, 86, has spent 40 years travelling the world, volunteering in schools via the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP). While she was still at university, Dorothy, who speaks Welsh as a first language in addition to multiple other languages, was approached by a friend who convinced her to use her skills in charity work. For weeks at a time, Dorothy would take time out from her job as a school’s inspector and visit places around the world, including Japan, India and South America. “We were still at our jobs – you couldn’t leave them for very long, but you could leave them for long enough,” she says.Dorothy paid her own way volunteering. Flights, accommodation, travel expenses and a membership fee to OMEP were funded through a full-time job and living a modest lifestyle. “I didn’t spend a great deal of money on myself,” Dorothy says. As well as setting up four separate savings accounts where she could budget her money for travel and day-to-day living expenses, Dorothy put some of her money into a house and approached HSBC for guidance on setting up an investment portfolio.Dorothy says being afforded the freedom to volunteer has allowed her to see hidden corners of the world and master three languages. Even now, long after her retirement 27 years ago she still volunteers at schools a few days a week – although much closer to home. “I’m still doing voluntary work,” she says. “It’s very important to me.”Top tips for saving for a major life goalInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.

The next five years are therefore crucial.”The plan emerged after the party revealed a wide-ranging set of climate measures at its party conference in Brighton last month. They included a £250bn transformation fund to help drive its plans for a “green industrial revolution”, including a £3.4bn national network of electric vehicle charging points and a vow to ban sales of new fossil fuel cars by 2030.The economic predictions were prepared by a team of economists at the Sustainability Research Institute, backed by the University of Leeds, who were tasked with analysing the impact of the plans over the decade from 2020 to 2030.Labour’s plan also has the backing of a panel of energy experts and academics who have signed up to a statement in support of the plan. The statement confirms that Labour’s energy plan is “feasible” and does not rely on “clearly implausible or inappropriate” measures to increase the UK’s low-carbon energy by 2030. Long-Bailey said the party was working with trade unions to “ensure that the changes to our energy system will be planned democratically, with the interests of workers and local communities at the heart of the transition”.Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said “the bold report” showed the scale of investment that will be required to deal with the climate emergency.“The report is right to say that we can’t hit net zero if we don’t immediately get on with delivering lots more renewable power, insulating homes and buildings and trialling at scale the potential solutions to heat decarbonisation. This all costs money, but investing more now will bring enormous benefits,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66a78f1ffe68ef3a3e1e1e37f0d8996758f47a4d/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5de1ee9da5990412aa67fc116409740","title":"sick of it cheshire town fatigued and divided by brexit","story":"Local MP Antoinette Sandbach lost the Tory whip over her Brexit stance but she says she represents the views of her constituentsWinsford is not one of Cheshire’s stereotypically leafy, affluent communities. An overspill town from Liverpool and home to the UK’s largest salt mine, Antoinette Sandbach thinks it is one of the most pro-Brexit parts of her sprawling rural constituency of Eddisbury.On Tuesday evening, the rebel MP voted in favour of the government’s Brexit deal, but joined Labour MPs and fellow ex-Tories to block its proposed fast-track timetable. On Wednesday morning, shoppers in Winsford’s precinct were split on whether it was the right move.Eileen Barnabas, 82, voted remain and supports her MP’s call for a second referendum. “There’s so many people who will be affected if we do come out,” she says, and in the event of no deal, “it would be worse again”.She thinks the parliamentary shenanigans have been “ludicrous”, and is unsure how she’d vote in a general election: “I used to vote Labour but I’m not too happy with them, but I certainly wouldn’t vote Conservative.”Leanne Dickinson, 55, was not eligible to vote in the referendum because she’s a Dutch citizen. However, she’s grateful for her MP’s actions on behalf of her children, who she says are staunch remainers, and is also hoping for a second referendum.“Lots of people have an idea that the UK can go back to the good old days and this belief that everything in the UK is really, really great … and it isn’t,” she says. “When people voted for leaving, they weren’t voting against the EU, but more about issues within the UK.”Vernon adds: “To be honest, I just want it over and done with … and take the consequences.” He says he would probably vote for Boris Johnson in a general election, although Moss says she’d vote with the rest of her Labour-supporting family.Dilip Solanki-Koli, 64, groaned when Brexit was mentioned. A refugee from Uganda in the 70s, the army veteran was selling poppies in the shopping centre when the  spoke to him. He served in Northern Ireland and says he doesn’t want anything to threaten peace in the region but says he’s “sick of it”.He adds: “The country voted to come out and the politicians are just playing games.” He won’t say how he voted in the referendum but says he won’t take part in an election. “Parliament is not doing what it’s supposed to,” he says. “They’re supposed to represent the people, but they’re not at the moment. I’m not going to vote at all.”Sandbach says her office runs regular surveys asking constituents what they think and is confident she continues to represent those views in Westminster. She objects to her depiction in some of the press as an “arch-remoaner”, pointing out that she has voted in favour of a deal to leave at “every single opportunity”. She says: “I’ve rebelled on process and I believe that parliament should have a say. I’m protecting parliamentary sovereignty against the executive.”She says she is appealing against the withdrawal of the Conservative whip and won’t be drawn on whether she’ll stand as an independent MP if she is not accepted back into the party. She thinks Brexit has “broken down the old party loyalties” and her “principled stance” has earned her respect. “People have genuinely seen that I’ve been willing to put my job on the line for their interests. And there aren’t many MPs that do that.”One of those is Steve Connor, CEO of a communications agency. He lives in a village outside Malpas, where some of Sandbach’s relatives’ names are displayed on the war memorial. Connor, 50, is a lifelong Labour voter and ardent remainer, but admires the “bravery” and “leadership” the MP has shown. He feels “totally disenfranchised” and admits he would feel torn in a general election. “If I was faced with a choice of a strongly anti no-deal, anti-Brexit rebel Tory v a Labour Brexiteer, I’d have no choice. I’d be voting, for the first time in my life, not Labour but for an ex-Tory.”Although he disagrees politically with many of his neighbours, he says “there is no culture war going on”. “My neighbours are still my neighbours, we still have our kids in the same swim team and we have so many values in common.”Sandbach says she is exhausted by the vitriol and “the hate”. She adds: “Frankly, whatever happens in the election, I know that I will have left my mark on Eddisbury, because I got some really major projects through that will change people’s lives locally. And that’s why I do my job.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/046a916ef83b1f60dccb5f68d1371299c5dc0314/0_253_3472_2083/master/3472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e412e82c308b9c6d3353fecf55467e","title":"is trauma handed down through generations ptsd conflict","story":"Psychologists increasingly think PTSD can be passed down – what does that mean for regions hit by conflict?Saleem says he can still see the faces of the young men he shot. More than a decade after sniper duty in the Lebanon-Israel war of 2006, he still has nightmares.“In this region we have a saying that a young man is like a rose …” He breaks off for a moment and then does not finish the sentence.Saleem’s first marriage broke down after the end of the war. His children stayed with him. He admits he was probably hard to live with. “I never talked about the war. I never talked about it at all. I locked everything away.”After the war he drove refuse lorries for a while. Now he is a taxi driver. He has remarried but he doesn’t speak to his new wife about the war. “I don’t like to leave the children,” he says. “I don’t like to be outside the house at night. For years and years I didn’t want to talk about it at all, but now I look online at night to try to understand.”Mental illness is universal, affecting hundreds of millions of people around the world. No country is spared, and when it comes to treatments, every country is a developing country.\u0026nbspCauses are legion: stress, shock, grief, trauma (particularly if sustained in childhood). Naturally, conflict of any kind will generate many of these causative factors and increase the risk of mental illness in the population.Study after study has proven this to be true. This mini-series, part of the \u0027s global mental health project in 2019, hears from the people directly affected. Saleem’s experiences since the war sounds familiar to researchers who deal with post-traumatic stress disorder. But what about his family’s? There is a growing interest in the idea of transgenerational trauma (TGT) – trauma that is somehow transmitted from parent to child and on down the generations.Saleem is careful with his children, and probably even over-protective of them. What about others? He knows men who can’t stop themselves from raging at the children, shouting, lashing out. “Sometimes the children are the same way. They see how their fathers are and they think this is the way to be.”For Joseph El-Khoury, a Lebanese psychiatrist who works with members of the militias that fought in the conflicts that have shaken Lebanon over the last 50 years, Saleem’s account is no surprise. The men he deals with are “very angry and resentful, and what they choose, a lot of them, is just to completely withdraw, do the minimum … you’ve learned that by serving or being part of a group you sacrificed yourself, lost friends, and you’re not better off.”The resentment, the anger, he says, is being taught to a newer, younger generation. “They hold the political views and the social views that link to that conflict, but they don’t make that connection.” You can see it in small ways, he says. For example, in the geography of the town, or who hangs out where. “There are no barriers but there are mental barriers, psychological barriers.” Trauma is what happens in our mind as a result of a particular event or series of events. It will affect different people differently: some may be fine or suffer only a few consequences, while for others the effects may evolve into post-traumatic stress disorder or depression. For many years conflict was seen as the main culprit, but increasingly physical and sexual abuse are thought to be triggers too.“One aspect of suffering one or several traumas,” says Peter Fonagy, a psychoanalyst, clinical psychologist and head of the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, “is a greater susceptibility to stress.”In 1966 a Montreal-based psychiatrist called Vivian Rakoff noted that he was seeing greater numbers of adolescent offspring of Holocaust survivors. “It is almost as if their parents, in an attempt to justify their survival, demanded qualities of their children which were the accumulation of their expectations of all the dead who were murdered,” he said.Since then there have been many studies looking at, for example, the children of holocaust survivors, on the grandchildren of holocaust survivors, the children of prisoners of war in the US civil war, on families in Northern Ireland and in the Middle East. There is also a growing body of research into more indirect impacts in large historical traumas such as the eviction of Native Americans from the land, or the enslavement and transport of Africans.The results are not entirely clear. There are studies which do find negative impacts - that the children of holocaust survivors, for example, can experience emotional problems of their own, difficulties in relationships, in the way they function. Researchers in Northern Ireland concluded that the transmission of trauma to children of victims of the Troubles made them more prone to developing toxic stress in childhood. But some research has ended up in an entirely different place, finding that trauma in a parents’ life can lead to higher resilience in children. And yet more studies have concluded that there is no clear effect whatsoever.If trauma is being passed from one generation to the next, what is the mechanism of transmission? Some interesting work is being done around epigenetics – the idea that the trauma may cause genetic changes that are then transmitted to your offspring. But epigenetics is a young and and still unproven field.The main mechanism appears to be simply the parenting style of the traumatised parent. Basically, are they a good mum or dad?Fonagy says that, in an ideal world, as a baby you have a primary caregiver who mirrors you – who smiles when you smile, and so on. “You internalise that and it becomes you.” The problems arise when the parent is unable, perhaps because of trauma, to perform that role.“When you have someone who has been very neglected, where no one has held up a mirror, then you have a gap there, a blank, a nothing. And when you are maltreated, you take that experience of maltreatment as you.”Research on rats has shown that when mothers are stressed in pregnancy or do not care properly for their babies, the offspring tend to get more stressed themselves, impairing memory and learning abilities.If trauma can be transmitted down through the generations, what kind of mitigation can be done? Some countries have recognised the potential dangers and are trying to stem them. Much work has been done in Northern Ireland, for example, to mitigate the effect of the Troubles on the older and younger generations.The Wave trauma centres are government- and EU-funded centres that provide counselling and psychotherapy and also run community courses on the impact that trauma can have on the family.But in Lebanon, resources are thinner. For every 100,000 people, Lebanon has roughly three psychologists and three mental health nurses. Western nations typically have scores or even hundreds.Stigma aggravates the problem, says El-Khoury. “We struggle to get people into clinics because they fear the stigma of seeing a psychiatrist.” Fonagy suggests the best possible treatment for trauma is not professional but social. Social networks, community, family, trusting relationships can help people to develop the capacity to reflect and overcome their experiences.“Adversity turns into trauma when the mind experiences itself as being in isolation,” says Fonagy. “The tragedy is, of course, that the very experience that caused the trauma – like war – will destroy the social networks needed to overcome it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb2fe0131a9849cd522a777ad178213511475327/0_210_2559_1535/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a2870de4209a5be927788c4c119c2db","title":"england ford farrell axis new zealand rugby world cup semi final","story":"• Henry Slade likely to make way for Ford in semi-final switch• George Kruis also expected to replace Courtney LawesGeorge Ford is expected to face New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final, with Eddie Jones springing another England selection surprise. Ford was dropped to the bench for the quarter-final win over Australia and Owen Farrell moved to fly-half but it is believed Jones plans to return to his dual playmakers against the All Blacks on Saturday.Jones will announce his team for England’s first World Cup semi-final for 12 years on Thursday morning and it is also thought Jonny May is winning his fitness race to take a place on the wing. In addition, George Kruis is expected to come into the second row in place of Courtney Lawes to strengthen the lineout.Ford’s omission against the Wallabies was a surprise given he had been arguably England’s outstanding player of the tournament until then, but Jones was wary of Australia’s powerful centre Samu Kerevi.New Zealand do not pose a similar threat in their midfield and Jones has repeatedly said he takes a “horses for courses” approach to selection. Like England, New Zealand kick more than most teams, which would further explain why Jones would turn to Ford. His recall means Henry Slade, who looked decidedly rusty against Australia despite his delightful assist for May’s second try, is set to miss out.Last week Jones was adamant Ford had not been dropped, insisting he had merely “changed his role”. He was also full of praise for Ford’s performance from the bench, describing his 19-minute cameo as “absolutely spectacular”.For England’s record-breaking win over Ireland in August, Jones turned to the Ford-Farrell partnership for the first time in 14 months. Since then they have started pool matches against Tonga and Argentina together, while Ford was named man of the match against USA when Farrell was on the bench.There is every chance the second Test of the 2017 British \u0026amp Irish Lions tour of New Zealand has also influenced Jones’s thinking. Farrell started at fly-half in the first Test but the Lions were outgunned in Auckland. A week later in Wellington, Johnny Sexton was handed the No 10 jersey with Farrell shifting to outside-centre, and the touring side went on to inflict a first home defeat on New Zealand for eight years. The All Blacks have since turned to a dual playmaker system themselves with Richie Mo’unga emerging as the first-choice fly-half and Beauden Barrett moving to full-back this year.Jones was asked if it was becoming a trend and he replied: “Twenty-five years ago we used to play with two stand-offs, one chunky and one slender, and they were a great complement to each other, so I don’t think it’s a new thing in the game.The All Blacks coach, Steve Hansen, predicted Jones would return to his Ford-Farrell axis earlier this week. He said: “You’ve got to assume they could bring George Ford back, so you plan for that. Through the Six Nations he mixed it up and he’s mixed it up in this tournament. You have to think he’s going to do it again. They’ve got a blueprint, as do we, regardless of who you put in the numbers one to 23.”May is likely to continue on the wing after Wednesday’s decisive training session.

Jack Nowell took a full part and will be hopeful of a place in the 23.Kruis’s expected inclusion comes after England struggled at the lineout in their only meeting with New Zealand under Jones. Last autumn the All Blacks clinched a 16-15 victory, with England losing five of their 10 lineouts in the second half.England’s security staff were on alert following claims by Jones the squad’s training had been spied on but the forwards coach, Steve Borthwick, said there were no plans to change lineout calls.Jones claimed England’s training session on Tuesday was filmed from a nearby apartment block but Borthwick said: “We’ll be continuing our preparation and training the way we normally do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e91e68d2d120f9281defc6993f8460072802c87/105_3_1825_1095/master/1825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa7defd312cdcff2b046e6f589df0c9a","title":"hundred mps ecb t20 county cricket","story":"• MPs told format is ‘biggest opportunity ever’ for English game• ECB officials say ‘we don’t want to cannibalise T20 in any way’The England and Wales Cricket Board has insisted the Hundred will be judged a success only if it “grows the game as a whole” after the controversial new cricket format came under sustained scrutiny from MPs.Executives from cricket’s governing body, including the chairman, Colin Graves, and the chief executive, Tom Harrison, were in Westminster to give evidence to the digital, culture, media and sport select committee. The subject of inquiry was “the future of English cricket” and, flanked by two World Cup trophies, the most senior figures in the game laid out their plans for what Clare Connor, managing director of women’s cricket, called “the biggest opportunity ever, for both the men’s and women’s games”.At the top of the list is the Hundred, a new format which will be played by eight city-based teams over the course of six weeks next summer. Some games will be shown on the BBC, marking live cricket’s return to terrestrial TV after a 15-year absence. But the competition has been accused of sucking attention and resources from other parts of the game and with opponents – complete with Stop the Hundred T-shirts – sitting in on proceedings, there was no avoiding the topic.Asked by the Conservative MP Julian Knight about the “extraordinary” controversy over the format, Harrison said the Hundred “is about growing the game and protecting things we value the most” and cited as proof the 50-over World Cup this summer.“We’ve just seen grounds across country packed full of fans,” he said. “Forty per cent of those were first-time buyers. The vibrancy, colour, noise and energy from those matches will live with all of us. The Hundred is an attempt to replicate some of that and bring it back every year. It’s not to take away from the counties but to make sure we use every advantage to grow the game.“Research shows we have 1.5 million who regularly watch cricket but over 10 million who like the sport. We have to bridge that gap, to reach out to children and families. We want every community to say “it’s a game for me”. To that end we’ve deliberately put teams in large conurbations with different target markets.“We hope county cricket fans turn up in their droves. We do not want to cannibalise T20 in any way. We will benchmark the Hundred’s success on whether it grows the game. Within four or five years cricket has to show it has the ability to grow.”Asked why the ECB had not simply rethought its offering in Twenty20, the shorter form of the game that was first devised in England and has become a global sensation thanks to the Indian Premier League, Graves said: “The new tournament brought TV back to the table. If we had stuck with T20, terrestrial would not have been there. T20 works for a market. We believe there is a market there for a new tournament.”Graves claimed there were “at least” four other countries looking at implementing the Hundred, if it proves a success.The involvement of terrestrial TV (alongside Sky, which will show the majority of the Hundred matches live) has been a central selling point of the Hundred. It was also a source of some wry amusement to the committee who noted the decline in cricket participation that followed the departure of live cricket to pay TV in 2005, following England’s spectacular Ashes triumph.The Labour MP Ian Lucas asked about the decision, ending his question with the entreaty, “please don’t do it again”. Graves, who was chairman of Yorkshire Cricket Club in 2005, said the ECB had “at that time possibly missed one or two tricks” but claimed the organisation was now in the process of “squaring the circle”.One positive structural change this time has been the creation of professional cricket in England for women and the Hundred will be the first sporting competition to have men’s and women’s tournaments from the outset. “Our plan for the women’s game in the next five years will see £50m invested,” Connor said.“We’re looking to increase representation in playing, coaching and other workforce roles. There will be three times as many professionals. Ten years ago you couldn’t earn a living as a female playing the sport, now you can. We should all celebrate that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/779da7a1ca7269f5cba6992878f975f5cde94c9f/190_382_4792_2876/master/4792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99059a0cd081918cbf3b77716ea7e343","title":"manu tuilagi honour haka england new zealand rugby world cup semi final","story":"England centre cannot wait to face New Zealand on Saturday with probably ‘the tightest group of England players there has ever been’Is the rugby world about to turn full circle? In 1995, when England last played New Zealand in a World Cup semi-final, a big man of Polynesian extraction proved the game’s dominant figure, scoring four unforgettable tries. Outperforming the late, great Jonah Lomu would be impossible but Manu Tuilagi is preparing to play the game of his life at the All Blacks’ expense on Saturday.Tuilagi was four years old and still living in his native Samoa when Lomu was tearing it up in Cape Town but, growing up, England’s nemesis quickly became his rugby hero. Now, having starred in England’s spectacular 2012 Test win over New Zealand at Twickenham he is primed to do something similar again. “This is do or die,” he murmured on Wednesday. “It’s probably the biggest game of our lives.”The 28-year-old’s playing weight is 1st 3lb (8kg) less than Lomu’s during his unstoppable heyday but New Zealand would be unwise to take him lightly. While it is almost seven years since the Leicester centre ripped open the All Black defence to help inspire a 38‑21 win for his adopted country, neither side have forgotten the impact he can have on games.For England to curtail New Zealand’s hopes of winning a third consecutive World Cup, they will certainly need a fully firing Tuilagi. Unless the All Blacks can be rocked back and challenged physically only one outcome will be likely.No England player packs more of an attacking punch than Tuilagi when he is fit and on the front foot. Even as an unused decoy runner he is a very hard man to ignore, and New Zealand’s midfield will also be bumping into an opponent for whom a World Cup semi-final against the All Blacks feels extra special after years of injury problems.Tuilagi is equally aware that any past regrets – and there have been a few – will melt away if England can squeeze past the 2011 and 2015 champions. Does it feel like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity? “Definitely, we know that. We know how important the game is but we don’t want to let that overwhelm us and affect us. You’ve just got to get the balance right. Being excited but also clear and controlled.”Whatever the number on his back – he has worn 12 and 13 during this tournament – Tuilagi will also be hoping to add to his tally of 16 tries in 38 Tests and repay the faith Eddie Jones has shown in him since he returned to full fitness. Beating New Zealand, though, is never about one superman operating alone: it will require 23 players to be at their best in Yokohama on Saturday.“2012 was a good day and a good win but it’s not about that day now. It’s about everyone doing his job, not necessarily doing anything amazing. Then the performance will take care of itself. There are going to be mistakes but you just have to move on to your next job.”Given his Pacific Islands heritage, Tuilagi is similarly looking forward to facing the All Blacks’ haka, which has always inspired him. “It’s an honour to stand in front of the haka and accept the challenge. You respect it. We grew up watching it on TV, so to finally stand in front of it is amazing. We always watched the All Blacks in Samoa. We also used to watch the All Black players playing in the Super 12 back in the day. It is exciting now to be playing against them.”Tuilagi will simply concentrate on getting himself into the right frame of mind for a game that will define the careers of him and his teammates. “We’re going in against the best in the world. It’s going to be tough but these are the games you want to play.“This group of England players is probably the tightest it has ever been. Everyone’s pulling in the same direction. The All Blacks are very physical and we’ve got to match that and try to stop them. If they get on top of you it’s very hard to stop their attack. We’ve got a massive job on that front. We’ll be trying to be ready for anything and I think we are.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2414043a699f5535ed09e307923390ea048e582d/497_238_3748_2250/master/3748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1ad3687b4b150ae47fec56f1ec663b6","title":"talking horses magical heads strong breeders cup squad aidan obrien horse racing tips","story":"Magical is expected to make the final start of her career in the Breeders’ Cup Filly \u0026amp Mare Turf at Santa Anita on Saturday weekMagical, who was hailed as the “ultimate racehorse” after winning the Champion Stakes at Ascot last Saturday, is expected to make the final start of her career in the Breeders’ Cup Filly \u0026amp Mare Turf at Santa Anita on Saturday week, Aidan O’Brien, her trainer, confirmed on Wednesday.Magical has won four of her 14 starts in Group One contests and finished second behind the outstanding Enable in three more. The Breeders’ Cup Turf, over a mile-and-a-half, is her official “first preference” for next week’s two-day meeting in California, but O’Brien will run Anthony Van Dyck, the Derby winner this year, in that race and attempt to win a first Filly \u0026amp Mare Turf with his talented and adaptable four-year-old filly.O’Brien’s runners, as so often, are the backbone of the European challenge at this year’s Breeders’ Cup, with his Ballydoyle stable likely to field runners in all seven of the meeting’s turf events. His long-standing ambition to win the Classic on dirt, however, will not be realised this year as the weekend’s feature race has no European entries.O’Brien warned that “a horse can change in 24 hours at this time of the year” but assuming that Magical lines up at Santa Anita, it will be the second year in a row that she has raced at all four of the biggest autumn meetings at Leopardstown, Longchamp, Ascot and in America. She will also be contesting a Group One race for the seventh month in a row, a sequence stretching back to her win in the Tattersalls Gold Cup in May.Magical is second-favourite at around 9-4 to end her career with a fifth top-level win, in a market headed by last year’s winner Sistercharlie at 15-8. O’Brien also has a strong hand in the Juvenile Turf where Arizona, second behind Pinatubo in the Dewhurst Stakes earlier this month, is the early favourite. Jessica Harrington’s Albigna heads the market for the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf while two more O’Brien-trained colts, Anthony Van Dyck and Circus Maximus, are favourites for the Turf and Mile respectively.In all, there are 32 horses from British and Irish stables among the likely runners at Santa Anita next week, with other familiar names including Billesdon Brook, last year’s 1,000 Guineas winner, who will give Sean Levey a first ride at the meeting in the Filly \u0026amp Mare Turf.A’Ali, the Norfolk Stakes winner at Royal Ascot, is one of two likely runners for Simon Crisford in the Juvenile Turf Sprint and a confirmed ride for Frankie Dettori, while Dr Simpson (Tom Dascombe), Dream Shot (James Tate) and Band Practice (Archie Watson) have also made it into the probable field next Friday.The Breeders’ Cup returns to Santa Anita for the first time since 2016 following a difficult time for the track in the first half of the year, when the deaths of 30 horses either during racing or training turned a harsh spotlight on welfare standards at one of America’s most famous venues.The Breeders’ Cup committee considered moving to an alternative venue but voted unanimously in June to keep the meeting at a course that has hosted the event more frequently than any other American track.Craig Fravel, the president and chief executive of the Breeders’ Cup, said that a number of new initiatives have been introduced at the course for its autumn season, which opened in September. Two horses have died during races since the start of the current season, while two more have suffered fatal injuries while training.“No jurisdiction in the world has been safer than southern California since the beginning of June,” Fravel said. “The California Horse Racing Board, horsemen in California, Santa Anita and its staff have done extraordinary work in screening horses and instituting new protocols. No stone has been left unturned to make sure that safety is the first priority.“There will be a team of 14 veterinarians at Santa Anita all week and all runners have to be there 72 hours out, so that they are available for inspection and review. There will also be 20 veterinarians on duty on the racing days.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99e72c6a508878bfbac8b4e41770490d211a43e8/0_118_4204_2524/master/4204.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89baa9b1f4ef6916ac843bc1eeaab789","title":"world series game 2 washington nationals v houston astros live","story":"Well the Nationals just walked into Houston and ripped two games away from a team that was meant to waltz to a second title in three seasons.

The end result is that they are heading home, knowing that taking two of three games will bring the franchise its first World Series title.We will have more live game action on Friday night in addition to more traditional coverage. Until then, thank you for reading, and wherever you are, good morning, good afternoon or goodnight. Marisnick bounces out to third and this ballgame is over!Springer chops to the left side of the infield and Rendon throws it away. The E5 extends the inning. Now Altuve has a base hit, and the Astros are content to waste all our time. Here is Jake Marisnick off the bench. Martin Maldonado hits a home run over the Fuddruckers sign in left, and I thought Fuddruckers were no longer with us. The train does its thing, which is admirable and sad at the same time. Now Reddick grounds out to second and the Astros are down to their final out. Javy Guerra is in, and he entices a fly ball to center out of Correa. One down. Parra skies to center. Inning over. Houston have three outs left. Michael Taylor with another blast, which leads to yet another celebration in the dugout. There’s lots to admire with these Nats, including their consistency. Turner strikes out, and Parra enters off the bench. Suzuki grounds out to cheers that are quite loud. Do they do Bronx cheers in Houston?Rainey goes 1-2-3 after striking out Alvarez. To the ninth!Oh, Rainey is in pitching now. I was getting cookies, which I think are allowed at this stage. There’s more “all they gotta do is get back to Cole and Verlander” type stuff from Smoltz, who clearly doesn’t get what is happening right now. Gurriel flies out to center, two down. Here’s Alvarez. Bregman flies to right. The Nats are building good will everywhere. Altuve makes a great tumbling stop at second to retire Zimmerman and end the inning. Cabrera’s RBI single scores Soto. Their fans are undoubtedly asking them to save some runs for Game 3.Kendrick singles, Soto moves to second, and Hinch is out to get James. We are in extensive gar-bage time, and it’s ugly. Hector Rondon is in to face Cabrera. FOX TV in the US tells us that there are just three teams to lose the first two World Series games at home and comeback to win it. They are:So I am saying there’s a chance, but that’s not a pretty picture if you live in Houston. Adam Eaton just put one in the seats leading to yet another cabaret in the DC dugout. Houston, it would seem, have more than just one problem. They are getting creamed at home and now face a long flight to DC knowing their sure thing World Series title is anything but. A wild turn of events.Robles strikes out but reaches on a past ball so he’s on first. Here’s Turner, who strikes out without reaching first. Strasburg is being hugged by four Nationals and deservedly so. Meanwhile, Altuve is popping out harmlessly to short. Two down for Brantley. Analyst John Smoltz is on FOX TV in the US giving “all Houston has to do...” type of advice to the Astros. But what he doesn’t seem to understand are the RPM’s on the the buzzsaw they’ve just run into. The Nats have barely lost since May and don’t look like starting now. Vegas need to look in the mirror. Brantley grounds out to first, inning over. Reddick walks, then Springer bounces into a 5-4 force out. One down with a man on for Altuve. Not what they were looking for out of Verlander says Captain ObviousHe was phenomenal after his rocky first, and held on through a tough sixth inning well over 100 pitches. Terrific outing. So here’s Fernando Rodney, which means Martinez is feeling really good about his chances. He faces Reddick to open the home seventh. Suzuki started this inning with a blast, and finishes it with a ground ball out to second. This inning is finally over, one that may live on in infamy for Houston and their fans!A roller to third, Bregman will have to hurry, he’s got it and he throws it away! Two more are coming in for DC! What a nightmare inning, and especially so for Bregman! He needs to put that ball in his pocket but instead, he airmailed it!Here comes Hinch to get Pressly. Josh James will enter. What a mess in Houston!Cabrera: a line shot, right up the middle, and two more runs come in for the Nats!Turner is in, so is Soto! What an inning for Washington and it’s crickets in Houston!Zimmerman steps in with two on and two out. Man, Bregman had to make that play...that’s an E-5 even if they didn’t score it that way. Ground ball to short, Bregman runs to his left and he can’t get it! Robles scores and the Nats have a two run lead! He’s gotta make that play!And the bases are still loaded for Cabrera!Rendon skies to center - is it deep enough?It is not! They won’t run on Springer and that’s just what Houston needed. That is also the argument agains the sac bunt. Anyway, now they intentionally walk Soto, which is absolutely the right move, and they will take their chances with Kendrick. Conservative: Eaton lays down a sac bunt that advances the runners. Am I allowed to like that move? Ball four! Two on, no outs. Here’s Eaton. They are reviewed, but you’re not alone in this department. Now Robles walks and here comes AJ Hinch to speak to Verlander. That will do it for Verlander, who had it for five innings tonight, but not in the first and not in the seventh. He is on the hook ands here comes Pressly in relief: heis operating with something of a balky knee. Tough sledding ahead, here comes Turner. Kurt Suzuki launches one to deep left center and that’s way out of here! There’s a dance party in the DC dugout as the visitors go on top! Wow! Astros blink first!Oh nasty! Strasburg floats a full-count curveball over the plate and Tucker can’t handle it! Strike three - huge stones from Strasburg, who is almost definitely done after 114 pitches. Great for Martinez to stick with him through late game trouble - old school!Full count: the merry-go-round will be in motion!Check swing, did he go? Yes! It’s 2-2 to Tucker...Broken bat, little fly ball a little north of second base and Strasburg survives Correa. Here’s Tucker, who will pinch hit for the catcher Chirinos. Pitching coach Paul Manhart is on the hill to chat with Strasburg. Tucker had a big hit last night as the Astros rallied in the eighth. Two on, two out. How will it end?Alvarez is intentionally walked to face Correa, which, despite the righty, righty thing, strikes me as a lotta bit crazy, regardless of his struggles. Two on, one out. Here we go!Gurriel laces a shot down the third base line, just fair! He’s at second base with a one out double and with Strasburg approaching 100 pitches, the wheels begin to turn for Nats manager Dave Martinez. Here’s Alvarez trying to cash in.

He discovered this accidentally, when trying to reprogram a rice cooker to talk.This wasn’t an idle endeavour. Koo had decided he wanted to create a play in which he could interact on stage with AI-enhanced rice cookers. As metaphors for the contemporary South Korean experience go, rice works on a number of levels: it sustains life, it bonds together – and it’s subjected to a great deal of outside heat and pressure.Yet the mechanics of this also posed a considerable challenge. For one thing, Koo had to employ an especially gifted hacker to get his cooking utensil co-stars to do what he wanted. “He told me that the most difficult hacking material is home appliances. If there is a high-temperature heating system, then it’s a real challenge,” Koo tells  Australia.This, it turns out, is an understatement. “During the try-out process, there were explosions of rice cookers,” he says. “One took out the electricity of our entire studio building.”The endeavour, though, was ultimately successful, and the talking rice cookers form part of Cuckoo, one of a trilogy of plays by Koo showing in Adelaide at OzAsia festival – a sprawling program of contemporary art which takes in everything from music to theatre. The offerings include a 20th anniversary performance of Nitin Sawhney’s Beyond Skin, the Japanese troupe Miss Revolutionary Idol Berserker’s utterly bonkers Totes Adorbs ❤ Hurricane, and a play based on the recent economic history of South Korea as told by one man and three telerobotic rice cookers.Cuckoo opens with Koo on a bare, black stage. In front of him are three high-end rice cookers: round, squat, nondescript, with wisps of steam rising up into the lights. He begins a monologue which starts with the International Monetary Fund approving a $55bn loan to South Korea and ends with a nation counting the human cost of their US-led rescue.Koo’s own visual montages and soundscape punctuate the monologue, as do the AI-enhanced machines. They interject, argue and even sing.The elements might be quirky, but Cuckoo is about something quite serious: the political and economic story of Koo’s home country and how international intervention affected people’s lives, including those of Koo and the people around him.“Around 1997, there was a severe economic crisis in east Asia including South Korea,” Koo says. “At that time, I was a middle school student and I was easily able to hear family rumours at school. For example, someone’s father was fired, someone’s family business went bankrupt, someone’s family lost their house or apartment, someone’s parents got orced.”He says when he decided to make Cuckoo, in 2014, South Koreans were not interested in interrogating what the financial crisis had meant. “But I couldn’t forget,” Koo says. “I lost many friends by suicide. The reasons were erse, but they were within the same context – depression combined with economic problems and social pressure.”This has affected the way the show has been received internationally. In some places it works almost as an idiosyncratic history lesson, but in others it’s all too familiar. A run in Athens, Greece – another country ravaged by IMF-decreed austerity – was a cathartic experience for all involved.“Some audience members came to my dressing room without permission because they wanted to talk about their stories. It was a very heavy and sad day. Their vision was also very dystopian, even apocalyptic,” Koo says.Touring the show has given Koo some curly experiences in airports, travelling through international terminals as he does with bags containing five interestingly wired devices. “Sometimes they are caught by luggage checkers at the airport,” he says. “Then we have to explain who we are and what they are.”Another problem emerged with touring. Once they’d worked out how to create the necessary AI for the show, they realised the cookers couldn’t understand Koo’s English. “It was not easy to make the program in Korean. But we have officially performed about 80 times internationally so far and there have only been computer errors for two of these.”Another – less emotional – variable in each performance is the rice itself. “For the performance, I need premium sushi rice. And sometimes they are not sticky enough, so we have to cook to check the quality of rice during rehearsal.”Koo is currently making tweaks to The History of Korean Western Theatre, the third part of what he calls his Hamartia trilogy. Cuckoo will soon be shelved, along with the first in the series, 2015’s Lolling and Rolling, to give him time to complete it. Nevertheless, he recognises the message of Cuckoo is especially potent in the current geopolitical context.And he still has plans for it.“Next year I will go to Hong Kong. I feel an urgency to share the work and participate in the civil revolution or activism.”• Cuckoo by Jaha Koo is showing at Adelaide Festival Centre as part of OzAsia on 25 and 26 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9814d4f9dd5943e526aa600aafe92b59adea6f/0_0_4469_2682/master/4469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd3b994b09719d52536da5dacd7974f5","title":"apple watch series 5 review the king of smartwatches","story":"Always-on screen completes the package kicking competitors to the curb and becoming a top reason to buy an iPhoneWhen Apple launched its smartwatch in 2015 to a lukewarm reception, some critics claimed it would never take off like the iPod or iPhone. But sales of the Apple Watch quickly eclipsed every other smartwatch and with wearable technology sales soaring it is expected this year to outsell all of the Swiss watchmakers combined.The latest Apple Watch Series 5 iteration, though still pricey at £399 and up, looks likely to continue the firm’s domination of the smartwatch market and deservedly so.If you are unfamiliar with Apple’s smartwatches, they only work if you also have an Apple iPhone 6S or newer connecting to the smartphone via Bluetooth. It’s a genius link-up that ties buyers into the Apple ecosphere, while adding an important alternative revenue stream as people hold onto their phones. But that doesn’t take away from the extraordinary qualities of this watch.The Series 5 builds on last year’s larger-screen redesign of the Apple Watch, making one small but important change: the screen now stays on all the time.It’s a feature every other smartwatch has had for years and is important for actually telling the time, which is absolutely essential for something to have a permanent place on my wrist.Until now Apple Watch owners had to either tap the face or do an elaborate wrist rotation gesture to get the screen to light up – and it never worked when I really needed it to, such as when running for a train. Now you can see the time at a glance at any time or angle. The rest of the Apple Watch has always been top notch. Equipped with the right strap – if you haven’t tried the Sport Loop or one of its many clones you absolutely must – the Apple Watch is the most comfortable timepiece I’ve had the pleasure of strapping to my wrist, beating some of the very best the Swiss watchmakers have to offer.It’s neither heavy nor light, and hides the heart rate sensor in a curved lump on its belly comfortably sitting atop your wrist. It fits easily under shirt cuffs, which some larger smartwatches don’t. It’s water resistant to depths of 50m, which means you’ll likely never have to worry about it when you take a dip in the pool.The screen is bright and crisp, clearly visible in all circumstances. I’ve never been a massive fan of the rectangular shape, preferring my watches to be of the circular variety, but the Series 5 has won me round over the last month.Apple still leads the way on haptics – the little vibrations and taps the watch makes to let you know something has happened. I loved them with the original in 2015, and they’re still miles better than anything else on the market five generations later.One thing you might not appreciate until you strap one to your wrist is that there are so many of them out there in the wild, all looking the same. I’m not one to conform to any particular fashion or club, so I often get that twinge of embarrassment you feel when you walk into a room and spot someone wearing the same shirt or dress.It’s made a little better with the Series 5 now you can have the screen on all the time and pick a slightly different face, but by putting one on you instantly become one of the Apple Watch people.Apple provides loads of watch faces, which are all infinitely tweakable in colour, with many having dial customisation. Then there’s a sizeable collection of widgets for things like timers, the weather, activity and others called “complications”. But I’ve found there’s always something not quite perfect about each face that I can’t change. I love the new Numerals Duo face, but I wish it could have the date on it too. I really like the Meridian analogue face too, but wish it had an option for numerals not just ticks.I also find the round analogue faces hard to read at a glance even on the 44mm Series 5 because they’re just bit too small. I’m being picky here, but that’s the thing about something you wear – if it’s not quite how you want it you’re going to notice it and be annoyed by it over and over.Of course the Apple Watch does more than just tell the time. Notifications are a high point. A little tap on the wrist and you know something has happened. Most you can interact with in some way. All of Apple’s apps work well, of course, but so do third-party apps. The Nest and Ring apps show photos of events from cameras for instance.Messaging apps including Signal and WhatsApp can be marked as read or replied to straight from your wrist. You can dictate what you want to Siri, draw out letters one at a time or send canned responses or emojis.Most Apple Watch apps aren’t up to much, but one that bucks the trend is the Spotify app, which gives you full control of playback on your iPhone from your wrist, including volume control using the digital crown. But it can’t store music offline unlike the Apple Music app. Apple Pay on your wrist is great too. Double press the big side button to bring up the card and then just put it near the reader as you would a phone or contactless credit card.Siri is great when it works, but can be hamstrung by poor network conditions. “Hey, Siri” works fine, but activates fairly often when I don’t want it to, ditto for raising your wrist to speak to Siri. I deactivated both features and didn’t miss them. Setting timers, reminders, alarms and other bits via Siri work great, but things start to fall apart with more complex tasks or questions. It’s the same on an iPhone, more or less.There’s no Google Maps app on the Apple Watch, which is disappointing. Apple Maps is getting better, but it’s really not that great in the UK. Citymapper offers an Apple Watch app, which is certainly better for getting around London and other major cities.Apple has slowly turned its smartwatch into one of the best multipurpose fitness trackers available. You name it, the Apple Watch can track or record it, apart from one glaring omission: sleep.The workout app has modes to track a huge list of activities and sports, from your usual running, walking, hiking, cycling and swimming to yoga, tai chi, dance, football, badminton, hockey, table tennis and even fishing.The Apple Watch automatically looks out for some workouts too. I get a notification to track an outdoor walk twice a day on my commute, which I found annoying enough to turn the feature off.For running the Apple Watch is surprisingly good, tracking everything a mid-range dedicated Garmin running watch would, including performance stats such as VO2 Max. It’s got a long enough battery life with everything going to track a marathon, but I certainly feel it more as a lump on my wrist than my go-to Garmin Forerunner 235. There’s a dedicated Strava app for the Apple Watch if that’s your jam.Day-to-day health tracking is solid. The heart rate sensor measures your beats per minute throughout the day, logging it upwards of 12 times an hour or on-demand for you to view in the newly revitalised health app on your phone. But it can also notify you of abnormal heart rates, which are typically high when you’re not doing anything.You can also manually take an electrocardiogram (ECG) by placing your finger on the crown for 30 seconds or so. The apps shows you the waveform in real time and notifies you if your heart beat looks irregular.Other daily activity tracking takes the form of Apple’s activity rings: move in calories, exercise in minutes and stand in hours, complete with nags to stand up each hour if you haven’t already. Steps and distance are also recorded, along with flights of stairs climbed, and you get awards if you beat your goals. Exporting your activity is fairly restricted, but as all the data is stored in Apple Health you can connect to third-party apps.Included too are menstrual cycle tracking and fall detection. New for the Series 5 is the noise app, which monitors environmental noise and warns you if you’re in conditions that could damage your health. It also measures headphone volume on the iPhone, which may be just as useful for those listening to music too loudly.The Apple Watch Series 5 comes in two sizes, various different materials and models with the option of 4G.Since its second generation the Apple Watch has been the best smartwatch for the iPhone. But for the Series 5 that’s changed. It’s not just the best smartwatch for the iPhone. The Apple Watch is now a solid reason to buy an iPhone in the first place.The screen being on all the time that was the last piece in the Apple Watch puzzle. What started out as a bit of a let down in 2015 has since been refined, sped up and had meaningful features added to it that make it far more than the sum of its parts.After five generations Apple has finally nailed it, but that’s not to say the Series 5 is perfect. It would be great to have sleep tracking to close the circle on health tracking. It would be better if it lasted at least two days so you could go on a weekend away without bringing the charger.I wish there was a circular version too for variety, and it would be better for everyone if they didn’t all look the same like some sort of clone army. Strap one of these to your wrist and you become part of a tribe: the Apple Watch wearers.Then there’s the price. At £399 and up the Apple Watch Series 5 is in no way cheap. The Series 3 is still on sale from £199, but doesn’t do it for me with that mostly-off screen. With the competition mostly coming in at under £300 the Series 5 has Apple’s typical premium – but it’s a premium anyone considering an Apple Watch has already paid for their iPhone.Simply put, the Apple Watch Series 5 is the best smartwatch you can buy right now. You might just need to also buy an iPhone to get it.Pros: excellent haptics, always-on screen, ECG, great health tracking, great activity tracking, solid running watch, 50m water resistance, all-day battery life, offline music, loads of watch faces, quick-swap straps, comfortable, Apple PayCons: expensive, only works with an iPhone, no sleep tracking, too popular This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

He did not answer whether the company would take down outright lies if they were in political advertisements.This month, the company declined to take down a Trump campaign ad that included a misleading portrayal of the former vice-president Joe Biden’s work in Ukraine.“Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?” Ocasio-Cortez asked.She also asked Zuckerberg about his “dinner parties with far-right figures” and if at those meetings he addressed the popular rightwing theory that Facebook cracks down on conservative speech, a question Zuckerberg also dodged.Zuckerberg’s testimony marked the first time he has appeared before Congress since April 2018, when he spoke at a hearing regarding Cambridge Analytica. The executive repeatedly acknowledged Facebook’s mistakes during the questioning on Wednesday.“I get that I’m not the ideal messenger for this right now. We’ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years and I’m sure there are a lot of people who wish it were anyone but Facebook that was helping to propose this,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d00df4ad24c0a510d5c55ab6c9c758a52bc22db6/0_3_6948_4168/master/6948.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73dc90a9556814301946561623b833ed","title":"tesla q3 earnings elon musk","story":"Results come after Elon Musk’s electric car company lost $1.1bn during the first half of 2018The electric automobile company’s revenues of $6.3bn narrowly missed analyst expectations, but adjusted earnings per share of $1.86 far exceeded expectations that the company would continue losing money.The company attributed the turnaround to cost control efforts, noting that “operating expenses are at the lowest level since Model 3 production started”. It also claimed to have “dramatically improved the pace of execution and capital efficiency of new production lines”.“Super proud of Tesla team for great execution \u0026amp support of Tesla customers greatly appreciated!!” tweeted the chief executive Elon Musk about the results.The positive results came after Tesla lost $1.1bn during the first half of the year. That had caused many investors to lose faith in the company even as it boosted sales of its vehicles.Instead, Tesla delivered a “jaw dropper”, said the Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. “The street wanted profitability and Tesla delivered in big fashion.”“We are highly focused on decisions that really make a material difference to the company, such as opening Gigafactories on other continents,” Musk said on an unusually restrained conference call with investors.The billionaire’s erratic behavior, including his infamous tweet that he planned to take the company private and baseless allegations of pedophilia against a volunteer rescue worker, have long dogged the company and resulted in investigations and fines.Development of the company’s new factory in Shanghai is ahead of schedule, Musk boasted, and trial production has already begun. He said the company will announce the location for a factory in Europe before the end of the year.Musk also advanced the timeline for production of the Model Y, a crossover SUV that was first unveiled in March, to summer 2020.Despite the strong quarterly performance, Tesla will almost certainly post yet another annual loss this year, just as it has done every year since its initial public offering in 2010. Since then, Tesla has amassed more than $5.5bn in losses.More financial potholes could still be looming on the road ahead as Tesla faces increasing competition, with more automakers rolling out their own electric vehicles to cater to the growing number of consumers looking for alternatives for fuel-burning vehicles. Many of those automakers will be able to take advantage of alluring tax incentives that are now being phased out for Tesla because of its head start in the field.“We have passed peak Tesla, it has already seen its best days,” asserted David Kudla, the chief investment strategist for Mainstay Capital Management, a financial advisory firm that focuses on the auto industry.Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, also warned of potential challenges to future demand. “The price of Teslas may be lower than in the past, but they’re still a big ticket, comparatively premium product,” he said. “That’s not a category that holds up well in a downturn – and the economic landscape is hardly rosy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5100d6d04f5edcba684b123477260c54228dc7c6/344_759_4506_2704/master/4506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca2ac4b3197f045b7d0050418f7b1a1b","title":"share tip pilgrim trail europe win 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"Routes all over the UK and Europe follow paths established by pilgrims centuries ago.

As a spectator you won’t be involved in the crossfire, but there is an incredible amount of oranges to contend with on the ground. It’s one of the largest food fights in Italy, and culminates with the funeral of the marquis. There is a huge variety of street food available at reasonable prices.

Up Helly Aa is a wild, torchlit party with costumed Norse revellers, all-night dancing and drinking, bonfires, processions and blazing ships which celebrate the island’s connections with Scandinavia. The main theme is who can be the Lord of Lerwick, apparently by being the last person standing as the festivities end. Many of the characters portrayed were real vikings with fascinating stories attached to them. The culmination of the festivities takes place on the last Tuesday in January (the 28th in 2020) the day after is a public holiday to recover.• uphellyaa.orgMike WilsonEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Over the course of one fortnight in November one of the biggest illuminated parades in the world travels around the county, warming chilly high streets with a procession of floats bearing thousands of lights, banging pop tunes, and sulky tweenagers dressed in masquerade costumes. The route takes in towns such as Bridgwater, Shepton Mallet and Weston-super-Mare, but my favourite venue is Glastonbury, if only for the conjunction of stoned hippies, drunk locals, and bemused-looking visitors. Bridgwater’s spectacular illuminated processions takes place on the first Saturday of November. • visitsomersetAlice RooneyThe Lemon festival is held at the end of winter in the south of France, in the small town of Menton (from 15 February to 3 March in 2020) to celebrate the Menton lemon. The theme changes each year, but the carnival always includes enormous sculptures made from oranges and lemons (entry costs €10). There are also multiple parades filled with citrus floats and dancers (tickets cost €25 seated, €12 standing). I found the whole experience to be unique.• fete-du-citronMilaLast November we visited the Tartófla truffle festival held in Savigno, a 45-minute drive south-west of Bologna. Aside from a brisk trade in whole white truffles and stalls selling truffle-flavoured everything, there were exhibitions, crafts and a huge pop-up restaurant tent serving a truffle-heavy menu. There was even a workshop where you could take your dog to test its truffling potential. Our highlight was the candlelit evening truffle hunting expedition (€10 adults) which took us through farmland with a truffle-hunter and his dog, finishing in woodland where the dog excitedly dug up a few truffles, though it ate half of them before we had a chance to catch a glimpse! This year the festival is being held over three weekends: 1-3, 9-10 and 16-17 November.• tartufosavignoMarthaLyon’s annual Light Festival takes place over 5-8 December this year.

There are spectacular fireworks, and street-food stalls selling mulled wine, soups and local, delicious, fare. There’s plenty to do in beautiful Lyon before dark, too.

The festival is held all over Spain, but we really enjoyed the one held in Valderrobres village, where on the night of the 16th there is a spectacular bonfire at which cakes and drinks are passed around. Early the following morning everyone is invited to participate in a community breakfast – mainly local sausages and chorizo roasted in the embers of the fire. Later in the main square locals bring their animals to be blessed. In the surrounding villages the bonfires are staggered so that people can enjoy several of them.

Now it’s payback time. As they are attacked by filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, are TV and movie superheroes fighting a losing battle against reality?Alan Moore’s celebrated 1986 series Watchmen revolved around a conspiracy to kill off masked vigilantes, and in effect that’s what it did in real life. Compared with the complex, mature, literary nature of Watchmen, most other comic-book titles looked juvenile and two-dimensional. This was at a time when “comic-book movies” meant Christopher Reeve’s wholesome Superman series, and when the only inhabitant of the Marvel movie universe was Howard the Duck. The entire industry had to up its game, and a new era of mature “graphic novels” was born.Now we appear to have come full circle – which is fitting for a story so heavy with clock symbolism. With uncanny timing, HBO’s lavish new Watchmen series arrives at a moment when comic-book movies are again in what you might call a decadent phase of the cycle. They have decisively conquered our screens and our box offices, with ever grander and more improbable forms of spectacle, to the extent that we’re now beginning to question how much more of them we need. Could Watchmen kill off the superheroes once again?The backlash has been building with surprising speed. Earlier this month, Martin Scorsese struck a nerve by confessing he’d tried to watch Marvel’s movies but did not consider them to be “cinema”. At least, not in the sense of “human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being”. Pow! His old buddy Francis Ford Coppola backed Scorsese up: “He’s right because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration … I don’t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again.” Bam! When asked, a fair number of film-makers think the same, it turns out. Earlier this week Ken Loach dismissed Marvel movies as “commodities, like hamburgers” designed to “make a profit for a big corporation”. Thwack!Alan Moore, who has distanced himself from all film and TV adaptations of his work, said pretty much the same thing in an interview a few years ago: “What are these movies doing other than entertaining us with stories and characters that were meant to entertain the 12-year-old boys of 50 years ago?” he asked, adding, “I tend to see a lot of these current figures as the focus of a kind of unhealthy escapism.”Many have rushed to the defence of comic-book content, and argued that it doesn’t have to be an eitheror debate, but there’s a sense that these fantasies can only reach so far into the real world before they’re confronted with their own absurdity. Post-Watchmen, the genre has been on a steady journey towards greater realism, at least on screen. You can mark it in the difference between Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman, set in a cartoonish Gotham City, and Christopher Nolan’s grittier Batman trilogy, set in what could be 21st-century reality. The contradictions opened up as the genre arrived at city-trashing epics like Batman v Superman (Who’s going to clean up all that destruction? How many civilian casualties were there?). Or Captain America: Civil War, where one politician describes Marvel’s superhero team as “US-based, enhanced iniduals who routinely ignore sovereign borders, who inflict their will wherever they choose, and who frankly seem unconcerned about what they leave behind.” The record-breaking Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame subsequently steered away from such complexities, and set up a fantasy good-v-evil showdown taking place far from populated areas. That could be read as a retreat back into “comic book” realms.Moore despaired of Watchmen’s effect on the comics industry, which he described as “like being in a hall of mirrors in a funfair, where you can only see ugly, distorted reflections of yourself”. He wrote Watchmen to bury the superhero genre, not to reinvigorate it. At the heart of the 12-part story was the suggestion that in reality (or a parallel version of it), those who felt compelled to dress up in costumes and inflict extrajudicial violence upon strangers might not be the most stable members of society. In Watchmen’s alternate reality, costumed vigilantes first appear in the 1940s (mirroring the rise of comic books themselves), and largely turn out to be psychopaths, rapists, sexual “deviants”, violent fascists and self-interested schemers. They become such a problem, they are outlawed in the 1970s. By the mid-1980s when the main story is set, these caped crusaders have either quietly retired, defied the ban and kept going, become shady government operatives, or leveraged their celebrity into business. There is only one genuinely superpowered being in the story: Doctor Manhattan, a physicist who gains godlike powers as the result of a nuclear accident. He helps the US win the Vietnam war, but ultimately tires of human affairs and emigrates to Mars. There are no good or evil characters and no evident “heroes” to the tale.The new Watchmen series, written by Damon Lindelof (creator of Lost and The Leftovers), takes the story in a different direction but retains the spirit of the original, not least in its jaded view of vigilantism. Just as the first Watchmen reflected the Doomsday-clock nuclear paranoia of the cold war, so this story, set 35 years later, chimes with America’s current racial tensions. The first episode begins with a re-creation of the 1921 Tulsa Massacre, in which a white mob waged war on an affluent African American neighbourhood, killing residents, burning buildings to the ground, even conducting aerial bombing raids. This is the first many viewers will have heard of this horrific real-life event. Our central character is a black, female vigilante, played by Regina King, and Watchmen goes on to incorporate lynchings, riots, institutional racism, the KKK (who were also masked vigilantes when you think about it), and a new white-supremacist terrorist group. For their own protection, the police also wear masks now. “You know how you can tell the difference between a masked cop and a vigilante?” asks Jean Thomas’s jaded FBI investigator early on. “Me neither.”Lindelof has acknowledged his status as a white man disqualifies him from speaking authoritatively about the black American experience, but clearly he is trying to push the boundaries of the genre. “The questions we wanted to explore were, why aren’t there any conversations about race happening in the superhero genre outside of Black Panther?” Lindelof recently told Variety. “In an entire century of superhero storytelling, what happened to the black superheroes? Did any of them make a go of it and because of racism they were pushed to the side? Because that is what would have happened in real life.”Watchmen is not the first sign of a superhero backlash. The recent Joker movie, for example, made a concerted effort to craft an edgier, more mature kind of comic-book story – by excising any references to superheroes and, ironically, taking its cue from the works of Martin Scorsese and Alan Moore (in particular his post-Watchmen story The Killing Joke). Explaining his rationale earlier this year, Joker director Todd Phillips said: “You can’t beat Marvel – it’s a giant behemoth. Let’s do something they can’t do.”In July we also had Amazon’s The Boys, based on Garth Ennis’s 2006 comic book, imagining a world where, behind their squeaky clean public personae, superheroes are corrupt, money-minded, corporate-controlled celebrities who abuse their powers with impunity. When naive newcomer Starlight is recruited into the elite team, she is immediately coerced into oral sex with a team member, then forced to wear a more revealing costume to up the ratings. The invisible Translucent is a pervert who hangs out in women’s toilets the lightning-fast A-Train relies on performance-enhancing drugs. There is murder, blackmail, corruption, and worse, all served with a strong shot of black comedy. They’re basically the Injustice League.In 2002, Alan Moore wrote a nuanced little story for a comic book tribute called 9-11: Artists Respond. In it, he feared the polarising effects of the attacks on the World Trade Center, the “us v them”, “crusaders v jihadists” narrative. “Dangerous, now, to simplify, to trade reality’s moral grey for comic books’ black and white,” he went on. “Writing comic book morality is embarrassingly easy,” he wrote. “Super-villains don’t need motives for doing anything – killing, maiming, whatever – they’re just evil.” He could have been talking about Osama Bin Laden or Thanos. Predictably, in his story, Moore chooses not to pick a side he comes down on the side of complexity.Perhaps it is coincidence that the current comic-book renaissance has mirrored the War on Terror and the rise of Islamic State, or perhaps such narratives thrive in times when there is a need for moral certainty. “People who wear masks are driven by trauma,” says Smart’s FBI agent in the new Watchmen. “They’re obsessed with justice because of some injustice they’ve suffered.” Maybe that’s been happening on a global level. Maybe still we need more of it. There are always arguments for and against processing reality through genre escapism and there are always “healthy” and “unhealthy” examples of it. It’s not black and white."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01a18842cbddf18288075286b22d02971b0f05fd/0_134_2261_1357/master/2261.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34014a8f2cd8a56828a02b0e7dc6f4ae","title":"alexandria ","story":"The Democrat made waves by challenging Zuckerberg.

Heck, outside of big national events, I’m going to bet you have never willingly watched C-Span.But less than one year since she entered Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has represented New York’s 14th congressional district since January, has changed that.AOC has shown a remarkable ability to extract energizing viral moments from stale bureaucratic meetings. She turns complex political concepts into snappy soundbites and boring old politics into much-talked-about spectacle.The is exactly what happened on Wednesday during her questioning of Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg about his early awareness of the disgraced political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which harvested millions of Facebook users’ personal information to influence the 2016 US election. The confrontation is uncomfortable to watch, with Ocasio-Cortez grilling Zuckerberg on key details about his knowledge back then – he denies having any – and then ending on the zinger:“You don’t know? This was the largest data scandal with respect to your company, that had catastrophic impacts on the 2016 election. You don’t know?”She is met with a squirming Zuckerberg and therein, a viral moment is made.This wasn’t her first time capturing people’s attention with her line of questioning. In fact, it wasn’t even her first time that day.Just hours before she made Zuckerberg eat his own words, AOC attended a hearing with the oil giant ExxonMobil.In the video, she shows Martin Hoffert, a consultant for the company, a graph he worked on from 1982 and asks him to describe it.

She gets the bureau’s assistant director for counter-terrorism to describe terrorism in his own terms, and then repeatedly uses his own definitions as a stick to beat him with.Ocasio-Cortez achieves the seemingly impossible: turning a discussion about the intricacies of campaign finance into a clear and immensely watchable three-minute video.

The rally had been billed as a discussion of government’s role in society, and was held in the downstairs room of a public library in Peterborough, south-east New Hampshire.It was an inauspicious start to the two days the  spent with Sestak, 67, who is spending three weeks campaigning in New Hampshire – including walking 105 miles (169km) across the state – as he seeks to build momentum for his little-known campaign to take on Donald Trump in the race for the White House in 2020.But it was also an insight into the difficulty that even seemingly well-qualified candidates have in breaking through the noise of a densely populated Democratic field, and the money and effort spent on campaigning that runs under the radar.Sestak, 67, spent four years in the House of Representatives, representing a traditionally Republican Pennsylvania district, until 2010. He announced his run for the presidency on 23 June. Before this New Hampshire sojourn, he had spent three months in Iowa, holding 235 events, driving 17,000 miles (27,000km) and, according to his campaign, “shaking nearly 30,000 hands”. He started his ramble across New Hampshire on 13 October, and is planning to cover 105 miles (169km) in eight days.On the same day, Sestak met Allen in Peterborough, the 12 leading Democratic candidates were debating in Ohio on CNN. The audience was 8.3 million: disappointing for CNN, but priceless exposure to someone like Sestak.Yet, to his credit, Sestak persevered with his one-person crowd in Peterborough. He’d walked there, after all – seven miles, from Dublin. Sestak’s staff will pick him up and drive him to some of his farther-flung New Hampshire events, but he plonks a stick in the ground at the end of each walk, and starts there again the next day.That same persistence was eventually rewarded at his Peterborough event, when, after speaking to Kath Allen and three journalists for half an hour, a second person showed up. And after listening to Sestak, Allen was impressed.He had answered her questions about senior care, and healthcare – he prefers the centrist Medicare-for-all-who-want-it-style plan, rather than the more progressive, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders proposal of Medicare for All. He had confidently fielded queries from the latecomer, about nuclear power. (He is in favor, but wants to use thorium reactors, not uranium.) But Allen wasn’t planning to vote for him, and she was skeptical about whether he will be the Democratic nominee.“I don’t think he can get it,” Allen said. “People want the flamboyant. And he’s not well-known.”“I like other candidates, I like Tulsi, I like Joe. I really like what Joe has to say on most of the things,” Allen said. “But I don’t know. I’m gonna see how this plays out.”By the time Sestak entered the race, most of the other candidates had been running for months. (John Delaney, a businessman and three-term congressman, had been running for almost two years.)Sestak announced his candidacy late because he was caring for his daughter, who had been diagnosed with cancer for a second time. Happily, she is now in recovery, but his late entry means other candidates have pulled ahead. It goes without saying that his rivals have drawn larger crowds. Some 15,000 people attended an Elizabeth Warren rally in Seattle in August, and her campaign said 20,000 came out to an event in New York City in September.As the 12 leading candidates prepped to go onstage, Sestak attended his third event of the day: a local Democratic party meeting in Goffstown, 40 minutes north-east of Peterborough.It was 6.30pm before Sestak arrived and started speaking – 10 people had shown up – and he had another event in Windham, 35 minutes away, at 7.30pm. He promised to keep it short, and started with a joke.“I’m actually in the debate tonight,” Sestak told the crowd.“Online,” Sestak said. “We’re doing a live stream, in a Dunkin’ Donuts.”Sestak had used the same gag at the Peterborough library, where Allen had been halfway out of her chair going for a high five before he dropped the punchline.As promised, that night Sestak held his own online debate. He answered the same questions posed to the candidates on stage, live from a Dunkin’. Sestak was sitting quite far away from the camera and it was difficult to hear him. At 9.57pm, just three people were watching the live stream on Sestak’s Facebook page, and the  was one of them.Part of Sestak’s problem may be that he is a centrist, white, older man, in a field with plenty of centrist, white, older men. Sestak’s USP, though, is his foreign policy experience and, given the chance, he ties it well to other aspects of the presidency.“We need someone who can unite this country and convene the world,” Sestak says, promising to bring the country together in the wake of Donald Trump’s presidency. met Sestak again the day after the debate, in Peterborough, where he had planted his stick on Tuesday. He had 18 miles (29km) to walk on Wednesday, and he expected to be on the road until 11pm. We set off walking east, uphill, at a fast pace, Sestak wearing black hiking boots. He walked across Pennsylvania in 2015, when he campaigned for the Senate – he lost in the primary – and believes the benefits outweigh any potential pain.“It seems to be catching a little bit,” he said of his campaign. As well as walking and meeting people, Sestak is running a TV ad campaign in New Hampshire.“We see people who are seeing our ads. It’s coming to a point of once you know I’m out here serving, trying to serve you, and they’re interested.”Sestak doesn’t regret entering the race late. But he agrees he missed out on early exposure.“Would my position have been enhanced if I had got in earlier? With the town halls happening, I think it would be a bit easier,” Sestak said. With his lower profile, his campaign has been told by some of the main networks that they won’t book him for interviews – even on foreign policy, despite his experience.That fundraising total, combined with his polling, means he is highly unlikely to meet the threshold for the next televised Democratic debate in November. But, marching uphill in New Hampshire, Sestak told the  he had no plans to drop out.“I wouldn’t go through this if I didn’t think we have a possibility of winning,” he said.He had an additional 16 miles (26km) to go that day – a long way, but nothing compared with the distance he has to make up if he is to be the Democrat’s choice in the race for the White House."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4060725.1571868389!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"examinations official criticises relentless pursuit of cao points","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tState Examinations Commission official Tim Desmond said it was welcome that the review of the senior cycle to date to date had highlighted a desire for a broad view of education.The “relentless pursuit of CAO points” is having an extreme influence on how students are engaging with teaching and learning, according to a senior State Examinations Commission official.Tim Desmond, head of examination and assessment, said moves by higher-education institutions to develop more specialised courses is intensifying the points race and inflating the public’s perception of certain courses.He was speaking at a recent seminar on plans to reform the senior cycle, organised by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.“I put it to you that nothing will happen in terms of changing the ‘education experience’ for the better unless the CAO system changes significantly to move the pressure point from the end of senior cycle to the end of first year in third-level institutions,” he said.“Only then can the heat be taken out of the second-level education system and its value beyond serving as an entrance examination be fully realised.”He said it was welcome that the review of the senior cycle to date had highlighted a desire for a broad view of education which included recognition of the value of achievements beyond academic attainment.But Mr Desmond said any move to reduce the volume of learning in a reformed Leaving Cert could lead to accusations that the system had been “dumbed down”.This, he said, could lead to Irish students being adversely affected by any future benchmarking against the UK system or the International Baccalaureate.Simply “making the school experience ‘nicer’ by reducing content and challenge will not serve those students well in the longer term,” he said.ChallengesMr Desmond added that suggestions such as expanding the assessment element of the Leaving Cert over two years – fifth and sixth year – or adding more projects or coursework components would pose challenges.He said this would approximately double the number of exams which, in turn, would lead to a need for greater numbers of already scarce examiners.“In a system which is very committed to external assessment where the SEC is currently struggling to appoint the required numbers of examiners for assessment events such as orals, practical examinations and interviews, a word of caution is offered here.“There is little point in blindly developing assessment structures and proposals which simply cannot be delivered within the school system and school year as they are currently configured.”He said the new junior cycle’s philosophy of broadening of the assessment was a good thing.However, looking to the years ahead, he said he was not sure if “having a multitude of assessment tasks eroding teaching time and clogging up the school year will be welcomed or beneficial”.Mr Desmond said that while no assessment system was perfect, the quality of our State exams stacks up well against what is provided in other jurisdictions.“Their high levels of fairness, equity, impartiality, openness and transparency with the viewing of scripts, access to component marks and a detailed appeals process places the service provided by the SEC at the top of the leader board in this respect,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4060687.1571861606!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"surge in number of international students attending third level","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tInternational student numbers grew by 26 per cent in the past three years, climbing to 14,412 this year. Photograph: iStockThe growth in the proportion of international students attending Irish third-level colleges is significantly outpacing that of Irish students, new figures show.International student numbers grew by 26 per cent in the past three years, climbing to 14,412 this year.Irish student numbers grew by 5 per cent over the same period, or some 122,257 in 2019.The growth in international student numbers follows a major push by third-level colleges over recent years to attract more students from abroad.These students are more lucrative to colleges, as they pay higher fees, and universities say internationalisation also enhances the quality of learning, teaching and research on Irish campuses.The statistics are contained in the 2019 Irish Survey of Student Engagement, which polled more than 40,000 third-level students.The survey of students’ experiences shows international students are less likely to report “excellent” interactions with other students.This echoes other research which has flagged a ide in colleges, with Irish students more likely to go home on weekends and internationals students more likely to remain on campus.In general, however, international students responded positively about their experiences at third level, even more strongly than Irish students.For example, international students reported significantly higher engagement in a number of indicators, including the quality of interactions with staff and the supportive environment at their institution.Postgraduate research students from overseas reported a particularly high frequency and quality of engagement in areas such as career advice, placement and internship, and training in entrepreneurship and innovation.The report says the findings suggest higher-education institutions are delivering an educational experience to international students of comparable quality to that experienced by Irish students.EngagementHowever, it flagged the issue of engagement with Irish students as a challenge that will prompt institutions to establish better opportunities for students to mix.Dr Douglas Proctor, director of UCD Global, said it had responded to concerns among international students regarding barriers to making friends locally.He said UCD had revamped its programme of support for international students with a refurbished hub for activities and events designed to foster interactions between domestic and international students.It had also hired a “global experience manager” to help with a range of initiatives.Mary Simpson, Athlone Institute of Technology’s director of international affairs, said it was now encouraging its students to “reach out and get to know our new international students as they can learn so much from each other”.“We understand that our international students come from different backgrounds, and staff encourage and motivate them, particularly during the sometimes difficult transition period of semester one on campus,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4060577.1571854361!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland exceeds greenhouse gas emissions target by 5m tonnes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe State will face substantial recurring penalties from next year for non-compliance on emissions – likely to run to hundreds of millions of euro. Photograph: John GilesPA Wire Ireland exceeded its annual greenhouse gas emissions allocation by more than five million tonnes last year, with the latest figures showing the State is far off track in meeting commitments to decarbonise the economy. Ireland has pledged to reduce emissions to 20 per cent below 2005 levels by next year but the provisional 2018 figures from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) show it is set to exceed its target by 5 to 6 per cent.The State will face substantial recurring penalties from next year for non-compliance on emissions – likely to run to hundreds of millions of euro. Based on current trends, there is no indication when emissions will be reduced in key sectors as committed to, notably under the Paris Agreement. While Ireland’s overall emissions showed a marginal decrease of 0.2 per cent last year, this was due to significant reductions in energy and power generation that were offset by growth in emissions from households, transport and agriculture.“Ireland has exceeded its annual EU emissions budget for the third year in a row,” said Dr Eimear Cotter of the EPA. “At a time of global urgency to address climate change this is a national trend that we must reverse.” Home heatingHousehold emissions increased by 7.9 per cent, which was attributed to a cold winter last year, leading to increased demand for home heating. Oil remains the predominant heating fuel used in the State, which the EPA said “reflects the scale of the challenge to increase the resilience of our housing stock to extreme weather events, in terms of energy efficiency and use of renewable energy”. Transport emissions increased by 1.7 per cent, the fifth year out of the past six where emissions in the sector have risen. “Reversing this trend will require widespread transition to electric vehicles, increased use of public transport and reducing the number of car journeys,” the EPA said.Agriculture emissions increased by 1.9 per cent driven by higher dairy cow numbers (up 2.7 per cent), reflecting national policy to expand milk production. Dairy cow numbers have increased by 27 per cent in the past five years while greenhouse gas emissions increased by 8 per cent. “While agricultural production has gained some efficiency over this period, these gains will not be sufficient to deliver overall emission reductions,” the EPA said. “Full implementation of the measures outlined in the climate action plan are required.”Energy reductions were driven by a decrease in coal use (44 per cent), largely driven by maintenance works reducing the amount of energy generated at the Moneypoint plant in Co Clare, and increases in renewable energy volumes. Electricity generated from wind increased by 14 per cent and the proportion of electricity coming from renewables sources was 32.6 per cent. Policy shift“Ireland has drifted off target and we must implement a decisive policy shift each year, every year. The 2020 budget has been an important watershed,” Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton said. “While the emissions have fallen for a second year in a row, the decrease is too small and driven by temporary occurrences. . . We have a brief opportunity to act and we must act now. The Government is determined to deliver.” Mr Bruton said the figures reinforced the importance of implementing the Government’s climate plan as it “sets out actions we need to take to ensure we meet our 2030 climate commitments, putting us on a trajectory to be net zero by 2050”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"French government says UK should examine deal \u0026lsquoas quickly as possible\u0026rsquoGovernment may challenge Data Protection Commissioner\u0026rsquos ruling restricting use of cardNational Treatment Purchase Fund pledges to cut waiting lists for common proceduresVivien Lusted: \u0026lsquoThere is no hospital . . . no medicine \u0026ndash where do you start?\u0026rsquoFigures show State is set to exceed emissions target by up to 6 per cent for 2018Siptu says planned strike this weekend will still go ahead\u0026lsquoPeople may never see orangutans but don\u0026rsquot want them to go extinct.That empathy isn\u0026rsquot there for insects\u0026rsquoPace of growth significantly outstrips number of Irish studentsAlthough primarily regarded mathematicianphysicist, George Gabriel Stokes\u0026rsquo pioneering biological experiments made a significant contribution to what became known as biophysicsDeveloping more specialised third-level courses increases pressure on senior cycle, says DesmondThere have been several cases of migrants found dead in heavy goods vehiclesCoveney appears to point to further intervention on devolved issues by UK parliamentLast year saw big increases in number of adverse reactions with 10,398 reportedEddie Og O\u0026rsquoReilly also accused of stealing notebook from journalisstTributes paid in the Seanad to businessman and politician, who died in AprilInitiative aims to help students to share ideas on how to tackle common problemsTaoiseach agrees to Tusk request to approve Brexit extension for UK until January 31stElectrician receives suspended prison term"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4060051.1571849474!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin boil water notice remains in place for at least another day","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA boil water notice is in place for some 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area.Irish Water and the HSE are to leave a boil notice in place for some 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area for at least another day. The decision was taken by the authorities at a meeting in Dublin on Wednesday and follows Tuesday’s statement by Irish Water that a mechanical breakdown had occurred in the disinfectant processes at the Leixlip water treatment plant. Irish Water said the Environmental Protection Agency will audit the plant on Thursday afternoon. , The plant supplies water to homes, schools and businesses across most of north Dublin city and the Fingal administrative area of north County Dublin, parts of southwest Dublin and parts of Cos Meath and Kildare. The boil water notice affects the largest number of people ever covered by a boil water notice. “This morning, during a meeting with the HSE we reviewed the test results and the impact of the Boil Water Notice. At the forefront of all discussions was the need to protect human health and that is why the Boil Water Notice will stay in place for now,” Irish Water customer strategy manager Yvonne Harris said on Wednesday. The areas affected include homes and businesses throught large swathes of the administrateive areas of South Dublin County Council, Celbridge, Straffan and Maynooth in Co Kildare, most of Fingal County Council, Dublin’s north city as well as parts of Co Kildare.Irish Water said the initial problem that compromised the disinfectant process of water at the Leixlip Treatment plant on Tuesday has been repaired. However, the utility said untreated water probably remained in some 20 per cent of the network.The HSE said there was a danger that untreated water in the network may contain cysts of cryptosporidium and giardia. These may cause gastrointestinal infections with symptoms such as diarrhoea and stomach cramps. It advised people who develop such symptoms to consult their general practitioners for testing and treatment. Irish Water warned there may be “residual” untreated water in the network for several days, as treated water flushes the system. A spokeswoman said the boil notice is likely to be in place for a number of days and that Irish Water will be continually testing the the supply and liaising with the HSE. Once the HSE is satisfied with the water quality, the notice will be lifted.Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrhoeal disease caused by a microscopic parasite (Cryptosporidium). Once an animal or person is infected, the parasite lives in the intestine and passes in the stool. Giardiasis is a form of gastroenteritis, characterised by diarrhoeal illness that is caused by a microscopic parasite, Giardia lamblia. Giardiasis is a notifiable disease in Ireland.‘Disastrous’ Irish Water has meanwhile opened a second investigation into the “disastrous” crashing of its website at a time when it should have been warning more than half a million people that their drinking water was polluted. The utility has blamed an “underlying problem” for the site - which it directs customers to if supplies are contaminated - being unavailable for several hours on Tuesday evening. Ms Harris said the website only “recovered” at 11pm. It crashed after a warning was issued shortly after 5pm that around 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area were at risk from their own drinking water. “The timing was really disastrous from an Irish Water perspective,” she said. “Typically when we send out alerts we would direct people to our website. The fact that the website wasn’t available yesterday evening was inconvenient again.”Caution Problems were detected at around 11am on Tuesday. After hours of testing by the EPA and the Health Service Executive, a decision was eventually taken at 4.40pm to issue a boil-water notice to hundreds of thousands of homes. Ms Harris said a “small mechanical failure” at “one of the older elements” of its Leixlip plant caused the pollution. “There may be bugs in the water that would cause a health issue for customers,” she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. Ms Harris acknowledged confusion among customers about the exact areas impacted, and she urged people to “err on the side of caution”. “If it appears from our website and the maps that you might have seen on social media that you are affected, please boil your water. We would ask customers to err on the side of caution.” Irish Water said water must be boiled for drinking drinks made with water preparation of salads and similar foods, which are not cooked prior to eating brushing teeth and making ice cubes.It said caution should be taken when bathing children to ensure they do not swallow the bathing water.For the preparation of infant feeds with water, it advises the use of water that has been brought to the boil once and cooled. Water that has been reboiled several times should not be used.It has advised caution if using bottled water for preparing baby food as some natural mineral water may have high sodium content. The legal limit for sodium in drinking water is 200mg per litre.Irish Water said it was contacting all registered vulnerable customers who are affected by this boil-water notice to advise them.It has asked anyone with queries to contact Irish Water on its helpline (1850 278 278) or to check its website (water.ie) for updates.Green Party MEP Ciarán Cuffe called on Irish Water to show what steps it is taking to ensure that such incidents “can not happen again”. He said it was accepted the water supply network was suffering from decades of under-investment but said the utility needed to reassure consumers their taxes were being used wisely in refurbishing the network and that the utility had a plan to prevent further release of untreated water.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe HSE has issued advice for how businesses and residents impacted by the ongoing boil water notice in the Greater Dublin Area should proceed. Generally, the HSE has advised that anyone developing the symptoms of gastrointestinal infections, such as diarrhoea or stomach cramps, should consult their GP for testing and treatment. Residents in affected areasThe HSE is advising that only boiled or bottled water be used in food preparation in affected areas. Those who are unsure about their water supply are also advised to follow the same advice.Boiled water should be kept in clean containers and away from any risk of contamination if not used immediately, the HSE said, adding that boiled water cannot be kept indefinitely for consumption. Ice is only to be made from boiled or bottled water, while cooking equipment, worktops and chopping boards should be cleaned using boiled or bottled water. The use of paper plates and cups is recommended as a short term measure to reduce the need for washing up. Using tanker waterMinister for Housing Eoghan Murphy on Wednesday rejected a call by Fianna Fáil deputy leader Dara Calleary to re-consider a decision not to send water tankers to affected areas. Mr Murphy said tankers were not needed because people can boil their own water.If a water tanker is provided in your area, the HSE advises that only clean containers be used to take water from it - and that containers previously used to store chemicals should not be used for this purpose. Tanker water should be brought to a rolling boil for one minute and allowed to cool before use. This applies to water for drinking and use in food preparation. For young babiesWhen preparing infant formula, the HSE is advising that tanker water, where provided, and bottled water should be brought to a rolling boil and cooled before use. It is best not to use bottled water labelled as ‘Natural Mineral Water’, as it can have high levels of salt and other minerals. If no alternative is available, natural mineral water can be used, but for as short a time as possible.For those sterilising feeding equipment, boiled and cooled tanker water can be used, as can bottled water. If bottles or feeding equipment are being sterilised by boiling, the HSE is advising that boiled and cooled tanker water, stored boiled and cooled tap water, or bottled water be used. This water should be brought to a rolling boil for one minute in a separate pan only used for boiling steralised items, before bottles or equipment is steralised in it for 10 minutes.When bathing infants, people are advised to use boiled and cooled tanker water, or bottled water. Food businesses and childcare operatorsThe supply of water by food premises and childcare operators is governed by strict European directives and regulations, which mean each buisness must have a water supply suitable for drinking purposes for use in connection with food or food equipment. These businsesses are being advised to stay away from disused private wells until the water has been tested and deemed satisfactory. Premises must supply antibacterial soap or hand sanitizer at all wash basins, including customer’s wash basins.Meanwhile, employees in these businesses have been told they must wash their hands frequently.

For many years Fr Jack Delaney was the chaplain to the Magdalene Laundry in Gloucester Street – now Seán MacDermott Street – in Dublin.He was also an amateur filmmaker of some accomplishment at a time when very few people had a camera.Over four decades between the 1920s and the 1960s he shot scenes of ordinary life in Dublin before the advent of television.Among the extraordinary footage he shot was some inside the Magdalene Laundry in Gloucester Street.The film depicts not the deprivation nor the abuse suffered by women in the laundry, but their annual concert which was described by Christine Buckley, a survivor of Goldenbridge Industrial School, as the “one happy day” in such institutions that they had every year.Fr Delaney brought his nieces and camera to the annual Magdalene concert which would take place in front of many of the clients of the laundry.The footage shows women in handmade costumes smiling and laughing as they dance around.Fr Delaney’s footage was discovered by his niece Irene Devitt in 1996. She subsequently handed the reels over to the Irish Film Institute (IFI) for preservation and dissemination.In the documentary Ms Devitt said she did not know how much her uncle really knew about what went on in the laundries.“I can tell you that I had many a night’s bad sleep thinking how much did Fr Jack knew. I think he was just not aware. In those days you never overstepped what you were supposed to do. What he would have thought? I think about it often.”Fr Delaney was born in 1906 and died in 1980. He served in some of the most deprived inner city parishes and many of them are depicted in his films. Children are seen playing amongst the rubble of Monto, the notorious brothel area, which was demolished in the 1920s.There are footage of young girls making their first communion, children running barefoot in the street and other occasions of celebration.Kassandra O’Connell, the head of the IFI archive, says priests were encouraged in the 1930s to have cameras to counteract what the Vatican saw was the immoral influence of Hollywood films on the general population.‘Sense of power’Some of the most memorable footage in the collection are shots of broadcaster Pat Kenny’s grandfather James who was the elephant-keeper in Dublin Zoo.James Kenny was something of a showman and a visit to the elephant house was a highlight for every child visiting the zoo.His grandson tells the documentary: “My grandfather created the showbizzy relationship with the public that my father really embraced because he loved meeting people and introducing the elephants to local children. He had no fear and the children had no fear.”Film director Jim Sheridan said Fr Delaney had a good idea and was a technically accomplished cameraman who knew how to compose a shot.“It’s amazing that 95 per cent are in focus and beautifully framed. There is a warmth towards people.”His brother Peter adds: “He could have been a genius filmmaker with a bit of support. That’s the feeling I get. This guy had a real sense of the power of the image.”Father Delaney, Silent Witness is broadcast on Thursday, October 24th at 10.15pm on RTÉ One "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4060737.1571898371!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"d%C3%A1il clerk s report on fianna f%C3%A1il voting incident to be published","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNiall Collins voted for his colleague Timmy Dooley, who was not in the chamber.. File photograph: Alan BetsonThe A report into the Dáil voting controversy is to be published today following discussions by the clerk of the House with four Fianna Fáil TDs involved.The Dáil’s Committee on Procedures will meet today at 9am and the report will be published soon after.The report will examine the events of last Thursday, when Fianna Fáil TD Niall Collins voted six times for his colleague Timmy Dooley, a Clare TD, while he was absent from the chamber.It is understood the clerk Peter Finnegan spoke to Mr Collins and Mr Dooley about the issue. He has also spoken with Fianna Fáil TDs Lisa Chambers and Dara Calleary, after Ms Chambers admitted accidentally voting for Mr Calleary, the deputy leader of the party, while he was doing a radio interview.Sources in Fianna Fáil said the party was braced for the findings with senior figures unsure if Mr Dooley or Mr Collins will participate in scheduled statements on the matter in the Dáil later.A separate complaint has been made to the Dáil’s internal ethics committee by Fine Gael TD Noel Rock about Mr Dooley, Mr Collins, Ms Chambers and their party colleague Barry Cowen. This committee is also due to meet today.It has the power to recommend a motion to the Dáil on the matter which could result in a potential expulsion of up to 30 days if the TDs are found to have breached ethics laws.The committee may examine CCTV footage from around the Leinster House complex to determine the location of the relevant members, one source said.Proxy votingMinister for Health Simon Harris said on Wednesday that the Constitution requires that a TD to be present in the Dáil chamber for a vote.“We need to tighten up this thing of voting in seats, I fully agree with that, but that shouldn’t be allowed distract from people heading down the M8, home to Clare, while somebody else stays in the Dáil and votes six times for them,” he said. “If you can’t vote because you are busy or you have something on, you certainly don’t ask your buddy to press the button for you.”The former clerk of the Dáil Kieran Coughlan has said the alarm expressed on the issue is understandable. He said that in the era of confidence and supply, the life of a government is no longer dependent on the result of Dáil votes and that many isions have “lost their political edge”.“The current difficulty of proxy voting experienced would be remedied if the existing rule was rigorously enforced and tellers would be able to stand over the accuracy of the vote,” he writes in an opinion piece in today’s ."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4060258.1571833031!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"d%C3%A1il told boil water notice to be lifted by the weekend","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA woman  stocks up on drinking water at a Lidl store in Leixlip. Phootgraph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinThe boil water notice should be lifted by the weekend for most of the 600,000 people affected, Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy has told the Dáil.Mr Murphy said a much smaller group of people was likely to be affected over the weekend, following the notice on Tuesday night to 600,000 homes and businesses in Dublin, Kildare and Meath.Mr Murphy said tankers were not needed because it is a boil water notice and people can boil their water.Earlier, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that the warning for people to boil their water was a precautionary notice. He said it would be a matter of days before the matter was rectified and declined to state when the all-clear would be given.“I don’t want to give a date I cannot stand over,” Mr Varadkar said.He said his own home and family were hit by the warning.Mr Varadkar said the problem arose on Monday when a flaw at the treatment plant in Leixlip allowed untreated water into the system.Mr Calleary said the latest notice from Irish Water said it would take a few more days but did not give a date or time and the website crashed when people sought further information. It was referring people to maps on its website that were difficult to read. “When an event like this happens their communications strategy needs to be robust enough to give people vital information when they need it,” he said. “It does not suggest that Irish Water has the contingency plans to deal with a situation like this.”Mr Varadkar acknowledged that Irish Water’s website crashed under pressure of use after the company advised people to consult it on Tuesday to seek further information. He said the utility’s first obligation was to protect public health. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said it was the most extensive boil water notice issued by Irish Water and asked if the incident at the Leixlip treatment plant last March was connected to this.She said the March incident led to a service audit being ordered by the Environment Protection Agency. Ms McDonald said the problem was a cause of worry as well as an inconvenience for elderly people, young children and those who were ill.“This is a matter of real stress and worry,” she said.The Taoiseach said the problem was rectified. But three “all-clear tests” had to be achieved before the boil notice could be lifted."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4060734.1571864396!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"macron objections delay efforts to secure uk brexit extension","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench president Emmanuel Macron is unwilling to wave through a three-month Brexit extension for the UK, sources in Brussels and Dublin said. Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergObjections by French president Emmanuel Macron have delayed efforts by Donald Tusk, who heads the European Council of European Union leaders, to secure agreement on a three-month Brexit extension for the UK.Mr Tusk spoke to EU leaders in recent days – including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar yesterday – in an effort to secure unanimous agreement to grant the UK an extension until January 31st.However, sources in Brussels and Dublin say Mr Macron is unwilling to wave through the extension.EU ambassadors met last night in Brussels but did not agree to the UK’s request. It is believed that the French government does not favour a three-month extension unless the UK commits to an election or a second referendum. However, it would be willing to agree a short extension of a few weeks to enable the British parliament to complete ratification of the treaty.StatementIn a statement to The , the Elysée Palace said the British parliament “should examine the withdrawal agreement as quickly as possible”.“We will see at the end of the week if a purely technical extension of a few days is necessary, to complete this parliamentary procedure,” it said. “Apart from these circumstances, an extension that is intended to gain time or to rediscuss the accord is excluded. We concluded an agreement and now it must be carried out without delay.”Other EU states, including Ireland, are worried that a short extension could result in the UK crashing out without a deal. In the Dáil yesterday, Mr Varadkar said he favoured a long extension that would also allow the UK to leave as soon as the withdrawal agreement is ratified.If there is no agreement in the coming days among EU leaders, they are likely to be summoned to Brussels for an emergency summit next week. Mr Varadkar said yesterday that his “bags are . . . packed” for such a gathering.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Pablo Martinez MonsivaisAPThe best line in Steven Spielberg’s otherwise inert biopic of Abraham Lincoln comes from one of the president’s dodgy middlemen. His job is to induce Democrats to back a constitutional amendment that would abolish slavery in the US. “It’s not illegal to bribe congressmen,” he says, as his reluctant paymaster, fresh from the White House, squirms. “They starve otherwise.”Spielberg could bank on a joke about 19th-century corruption to still raise a chuckle in 2012. There was enough cynicism around. It was there every time people said that politicians were “all the same” or ranked them below car dealers in the hierarchy of professional trust. It was there when leaders were said to have “lied” about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, when credulity and incompetence had been their truer failings.The politician as crook: there is no doubting the timelessness of the trope. The question is where it got us.Populism was not just a response to economic dispossession and ethnic grievance. It also fed on a fashionable and unwarranted cynicism about politics. In a country where politicians are mostly respected, Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy would never have been viable. In a country where they are assumed to be venal liars, he is “no worse than the rest of them”, and perhaps better for his lack of moral pretences.Public confidenceAt this juncture, it is customary to tell politicians to therefore clean up their trade, the better to restore public confidence. This is to let the rest of us off much too lightly. At some point, voters themselves must curb a mistrust of public life that is extravagantly out of proportion with its actual dirtiness.Yes, there is some civic fumigation to be done. The ease with which people flit between government and the lobbying of government is unconscionable. Campaign donations, the oil in the engine of US politics, should be more tightly controlled. Trump did not imagine the “swamp”, even if he then paddled in it with gusto.But even if all these stains are taken together, they would not warrant the negativity that for so long passed in polite company as worldliness. In 2015, 18 per cent of Americans said they trusted Washington all or most of the time. Even before the 2008 financial crash, the number was just 24 per cent. This was in a rich, tolerably well-governed country, deep into a boom, where crime was falling and corruption was low.In 2016, the US was the 18th-cleanest country out of 176, according to Transparency International. You are forced to reach for the Iraq war as the only explanation for this mistrust. But then the figure for the mid-1990s, that belle époque of peace and plenty, was 17 per cent. Suspicion has become a structural feature of US politics, not a cyclical or event-dependent one.Self-dealing banditsBritain (the 10th-cleanest country in 2016) is another nation that is convinced, against all evidence, that it has been run by self-dealing bandits since forever. Guy Fawkes was the “last man to enter parliament with honest intentions”, says any giggling banter merchant at a dinner party. And in entertaining this delusion for so long, to such corrosive effect, it has ultimately come true.The more we described as liars people who were not liars, the easier it became for liars to say they were not liars. Authentic villains got lost in the haze of indiscriminate cynicism.It is telling how few of Trump’s supporters have mounted a defence of his own behaviour of late. Instead, they make tu quoque arguments about the Democrats. It was a favourite of Soviets during the cold war, this whataboutism, which makes it all the more piquant in the mouths of US conservatives. And still, all they are doing is honouring a culture – fomented by liberals as much as the right – in which everyone in high office is held to be chin-deep in muck.It is there as far back as Chaucer, never mind Shakespeare, this idea of the corrupt churchman or senator. Democracy cannot do without a certain measure of scepticism. But cynicism is another thing, and nihilism yet another. They lead to what the historian Richard Hofstadter called “the paranoid style in American politics”, where conspiracy theories flourish and fringe elements prosper.In recent years, the answer to populism has been tougher scrutiny of politicians, hence all the fact-checking of their statements and scrutiny of their funding. But the solution also requires something counter-intuitive: a base level of respect for their trade. The idea that we all live in some great Tammany Hall of deceit and graft is not just wrong. It enables it to become true. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Home front war heroes who protected St Paul\u0026#39s Cathedral during Blitz honoured in new light showDonald Trump claims he is securing the oil in Syria for the US - here\u0026#39s the realityComment: Fatuous Remainer MPs have just become the useful idiots of the Leave causeLove will help Harry and Meghan avoid fate of Charles and Diana, ex-butler saysRose McGowan sues alleging intimidation by WeinsteinDriverless cars to carry human passengers on UK roads for first timeDon\u0026#39t make yourself comfortable: GPs to trial standing appointments to \u0026#39set an example\u0026#39Children are being sexually abused every seven minutes, NSPCC reveals as figures hit new highThousands of cyber crime reports quarantined by police after computer glitch branded them security riskEurope cannot be complacent over people smugglers and must now galvanise efforts to tackle this pernicious problemScientist who created pioneering diabetic tool awarded £2m after 13-year legal battle with former employersFurniture shop owner who deliberately caused an explosion that injured 81 people in a botched insurance job jailed for 20 yearsParents urged to vaccinate children against whooping cough as number of cases rises four-fold Labour peer who joked about a transgender campaign and sexually harassed women has been ordered to undergo \u0026#39behavioural coaching\u0026#39Comment: The Royal Opera House was supposed to open up - now it looks like a closed club  Royal Opera House facing ticket row after majority of seats for must-see show sell out day before official saleA fateful journey that led to 39 deaths in an Essex industrial park and the arrest of a Northern Irish truck driverComment: We need a general election now to clear out this Parliament of wreckersCross-party MPs hatch plot to ban fracking, with Queen\u0026#39s Speech vote facing chaotic amendmentsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed gcse grades versus fees find leading private schools","story":"With more than a thousand private schools to choose from, how do you work out which one to select? Some boast of state-of-the art sports and music facilities, while others talk up their pastoral care and wellbeing initiatives. But there is one thing that their pitch has in common: exam results.And a question often at the forefront of parents’ minds is:  Will it be worth it?With fees rising year on year, how do you know if a school is good value for money? Using information from the Independent Schools Council (ISC) as well as our own research and analysis, we have compiled a comprehensive database of private schools’ fees mapped against exam results.Find your schoolOur interactive tool allows you to search for every school in England  - where their GCSE results are publicly available - and see how they fare against others in terms of value for money. Hovering over a diamond on the graphic brings up the school’s name as well as its fees per term and the proportion of grades which were awarded As and A*, or grades 7 to 9, in GCSEs or iGCSEs in 2019.Independent schools value for money - GCSE day (behind subwall)How it worksToday we are publishing the data for GCSE results and next week we will do the same for A-level results.We have created one graphic for day schools and another for boarding schools which generally charge higher fees. Schools which have both day and boarding provision will appear in both graphics, with the appropriate level of fees reflected in each one.Independent schools value for money - GCSE boarding (behind subwall)What we foundParents are paying more than £27,000 a year to send children to a private school where just 12 per cent of their GCSE exams will be awarded top grades, according to our analysis.Bellersby College London, which charges £9,020 per term for day pupils, has emerged as one of the most expensive day schools in the country but where pupils achieve among the lowest proportions of As and A*s, or grades 7-9, in GCSEs compared with other fee-paying institutions.  Among the most costly boarding schools was DLD College in London, where fees are £17,666 a term but just 28.07 per cent of GCSEs are awarded top grades.The college was established in 1931 to provide tutoring for prospective applicants for Oxford and Cambridge universities, as well as those preparing for Colonial Service entrance exams.Search for the best independent schools for GCSE resultsSearch for the best independent schools for 2019 A-level resultsSearch for the best grammar schoolsMeanwhile, Badminton School was identified as one of the best value boarding schools as it had one of the highest proportion of top exam grades but among the lowest fees.At the all-girls school in Bristol, which charges £5,475 a term for day pupils and £10,765 for boarders, 77 per cent of pupils achieved A-A*s or 7-9s in their GCSEs this year.Rebecca Tear, the headteacher, said that her pupils do not just “jump through exam board hoops”, but get a “hands-on” approach to their education. “It’s all about community here,” Mrs Tear said.  “Within the community the girls know one another, the older and younger girls, they know the teachers, and you’ve got really strong relationships both in and out of the classroom.“I really strongly believe that to learn, you have to be a little bit uncomfortable, you have to go through your comfort zone and push yourself.  Here, because we’re all so familiar, they are prepared to take those risks, to ask their teachers and ask each other.”The school, which was founded in 1858, counts Indira Gandhi, the first female Prime Minister of India and the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnae.Badminton School in Bristol counts the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnaeWinchester College, Charterhouse and Wellington College were among the top five most expensive day schools.Winchester College, an all-boys school which charges £13,304 per term, had the best results out of the three with 87.3 per cent of GCSEs awarded top grades. Private schools have come under pressure in recent years for hiking fees. “The danger the sector is in is that it has lost the middle class,” said Martin Stephen, the former headmaster of St Paul’s Boys’ School.“Part of the reason is as simple as the fact that they have been able to put the fees up and not reduce the number of applicants.”At Winchester College,  87.3 per cent of GCSES were awarded AA* or 7-9 this yearBarnaby Lenon, the chair of the ISC and a former headmaster at Harrow School, agreed that the biggest threat for private schools is “if they don’t hold their fees down”.He said: “Although it is true that the average fee has risen faster than salaries  - which is not a good thing - nevertheless there are still a pretty large number of schools with fees around £14,000.“Secondly now many more women work so there is more money available to pay fees than in the old days when often mother did not work. Schools have greatly increased the number of bursaries which are available for families who can only afford half or three quarters of a fee.“I totally agree that independent schools have to watch out that they don’t price parents out of the market, they are very aware of that and have made a huge effort to hold fees down.”Mr Lenon said there had been a growing realisation among parents that the relationship between exam results and success in life is not as strong as people once thought. He explained that with half the population now going to university, the premium attached to it has been slightly reduced. And with the growing number of problems with pupil mental health, this is something parents care about more, he said. Let\u0027s face it if you ask parents what they want most for their children, the first thing they will say is not results. It\u0027s that they are happy, make good friends, are safe and secure.Barnaby Lenon is a former headmaster at Harrow SchoolBellersby College and DLD College both said that the majority of their pupils are from outside of the EU, and do not speak English as a first language.“Arrival at Bellerbys is often their first time away from home, meaning they have to make academic, cultural and language adjustments,” a spokesman for Bellersby College London said.“We specialise in caring for these young adults, tutoring them and preparing them for university entry and the future world of work. 399 of our 2019 graduates progressed to a top 50 UK university. We\u0027re extremely proud of every cohort.DLD College said they work with a number of students who have found education “challenging”, and success cannot be measured by looking grades alone.“Our students enjoy five-star, secure and safe boarding in the same building with a strong co-curricular programme to match, a spokesman said. “For these reasons, the cost of boarding in this part of London cannot be easily compared with the cost of a boarding school in other locations.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

She is set to be elected vice president on October 27The resurgence of Argentina’s firebrand Leftists has raised concern among Falklanders that Sunday’s election could return anti-British sentiment to the country. Cristina Kirchner, who made sabre-rattling over the Falklands a pillar of her 2007-2015 presidency, is poised to make a return to the frontlines as vice president to her successor Alberto Fernandez. “A generation of young islanders have been taught by the Kirchner regime not to trust Argentina,” said Roger Spink, a member of the Falkland Islands legislative assembly.Polls have put Mr Fernandez comfortably ahead of the centre-right President Mauricio Macri, despite the prominence of Mrs Kirchner, who has faced 13 corruption cases since she stepped down. Economic meltdown that forced the largest International Monetary Fund bailout in history and seen inflation rocket to 55 per cent has destroyed Mr Macri’s reputation, pushing Argentinians back in the arms of Peronists. The Falkland Islands, 3,000 miles off the coast of the UKMr Macri pursued a pragmatic approach to the Falklands, but Mrs Kirchner made the fate of the territory the focus of British-Argentine relations and pursued policies to disrupt its economy. During her presidency, Mrs Kirchner attempted to stop the weekly flights that cross Argentina airspace from Chile to get to the islands. She also sought to discourage cruise ships from stopping off in the archipelago, trying to prevent them from passing from Argentine ports to Falkland ones. And she made every effort to disrupt the Falklands’ burgeoning oil industry, which is scheduled to come online around 2024. “I wouldn’t say that there was universal joy when she announced her comeback,” Mr Spink told The .  “We absolutely respect the rights of the Argentine people to choose their own president, just as we expect them to respect our right to remain British, as we choose.Soldiers in battle during the Falklands War of 1982“But of course you’re always interested to find out what angle the new president is coming from.” The Falklands have been in British hands since 1833, but Argentina has waged a diplomatic battle - that spilled into economic and then actual warfare - since the 1960s to try to gain control of the archipelago.Argentine troops invaded the windswept islands for 74 days in 1982, before Britain swiftly defeated them. In 2013 a referendum was held in the Falklands, where 99.8 per cent of the 3,000 islanders voted to remain British.Of the 1,517 voters, only three said \u0027No\u0027, while one ballot was invalid. Mr Macri, Mrs Kirchner’s predecessor, has charted a “less aggressive” course, said Mr Spink.Mauricio Macri, president of Argentina, met then-foreign secretary Philip Hammond in 2017. Mr Hammond was the first foreign secretary to visit Argentina in 16 yearsHe has, of course, not renounced Argentina’s claim to the islands. But he realised that making the Falklands the focus of all encounters between London and Buenos Aires was not necessarily in his peoples’ best interests.“Over the past couple of years we have pressed forwards with our commitments,” said Mr Spink. DNA from 89 fallen Argentina soldiers was identified, 35 years after their deaths, by a mutually-agreed team.Argentine relatives in March 2018 travelled to the islands to pay their respects at graves which finally bore their loved ones’ name – a triumph of diplomacy.“This is all to the benefit of their people too,” said Mr Spink. “I think that whoever is elected we would wish to have a constructive relationship. “We’ve been through difficult times before. We have to just wait and see.” Home front war heroes who protected St Paul\u0026#39s Cathedral during Blitz honoured in new light showDonald Trump claims he\u0026#39s securing the oil in Syria for the US -

Jack Whitehall’s performance was panned by critics who said he appeared “desperate to shock” as delinquent teacher Alfie Wickers and described the whole movie as a “farce”.This 1977 film based on BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? took its inspiration from a theatre production in Blackpool.

After a rocky start when the first season was cancelled on NBC, it became the world\u0027s most-watched TV show, running in its original format for 10 years until 1999. The unnecessary big-screen version of the show starred Dwayne Johnson in Hasselhoff’s role and Zac Efron as a new recruit. Even the nostalgic cameo from the show\u0027s former star didn’t make up for the paper-thin plot.Because nose-centric glory for Nicole Kidman couldn’t happen twice, this adaptation of sparkly magical sitcom Bewitched arrived two years after the actor won her Oscar for The Hours, and promptly became a key component in her Queen of Flops reputation throughout the late-2000s. This had brilliance written all over it, from Nora Ephron behind the camera to Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman and Shirley MacLaine in the supporting cast, but still somehow managed to stink.Leigh Francis character Keith Lemon received the big screen treatment in 2012\u0027s Keith Lemon: The Film, one of the only titles to have ever received zero per cent on Rotten Tomatoes.

Most egregious, however, was the film’s failure to properly utilise Michelle Pfeiffer 20 years after she played Catwoman in Burton’s Batman Returns.Julian Fellowes took the beloved TV drama about the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and the people who serve them – and turned it into one long fawning session about the royals.

Every second paled in comparison to ever single episode of the classic BBC series.The experience of watching the first ever Pokémon film – titled Pokémon: The First Movie – can be likened to watching a YouTube tutorial of someone playing a Pokémon video game, only somehow more boring.The charming story of Postman Pat and his black and white cat in the fictional and busy village of Greendale first screened on the BBC in 1981. What a shame that Postman Pat: The Movie in 2014 – the 3D animated feature film version – managed to stray so far from its original simplicity. It sees Postman Pat (voiced by Stephen Mangan) enter an X-Factor style-singing contest, and despite featuring an impressive array of voice actors, including Rupert Grint, Jim Broadbent and David Tennant, the film was too scary for the under-fives – especially the scene that sees Pat turn into a sinister robot.2129 Sex and the CitySex and the City had all the ingredients for a great movie: starry cast, cult fanbase, glamorous setting. Alas, both films were an embarrassment to the original series. Not enough happened in the movies to warrant anything longer than a 30-minute episode and unfortunately we can never unsee Sarah Jessica Parker and co doing that bizarre slo-mo walk through the desert.The problem with 2015 film Spooks: The Greater Good is that is arrived about 10 years too late. Spooks was a decent BBC drama that ended in 2011 and that\u0027s how it should have stayed.Based on the 1975 series of the same name, this action crime thriller starred Samuel L Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, and Colin Farrell in one of his early box office hits. There was plenty of high-octane drama and Farrell was convincing as a hot-shot cop taking on a French drug lord (Olivier Martinez), but it’s also completely predictable and, ultimately, extremely pointless.An updated version of BBC crime series The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone sounds like something from spoof heaven. The finished film, released in 2012, didn\u0027t really do much to convince anyone that it wasn\u0027t. Sure, Ben Kingsley as The Hood is a great spot of casting, but practically everything else in the film version of Gerry Anderson\u0027s Thunderbirds failed to make the grade. Anderson himself was most damning he called it the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.There are some interesting things in Twilight Zone: The Movie, but it loses points for featuring one of the worst pieces of work from Steven Spielberg: a segment set in a retirement home titled Kick the Can.Just because the Veronica Mars cast and its loyal fans really wanted a movie spin-off to be made, it doesn’t mean it should have ever actually happened.

Every second paled in comparison to ever single episode of the classic BBC series.The experience of watching the first ever Pokémon film – titled Pokémon: The First Movie – can be likened to watching a YouTube tutorial of someone playing a Pokémon video game, only somehow more boring.The charming story of Postman Pat and his black and white cat in the fictional and busy village of Greendale first screened on the BBC in 1981. What a shame that Postman Pat: The Movie in 2014 – the 3D animated feature film version – managed to stray so far from its original simplicity. It sees Postman Pat (voiced by Stephen Mangan) enter an X-Factor style-singing contest, and despite featuring an impressive array of voice actors, including Rupert Grint, Jim Broadbent and David Tennant, the film was too scary for the under-fives – especially the scene that sees Pat turn into a sinister robot.2129 Sex and the CitySex and the City had all the ingredients for a great movie: starry cast, cult fanbase, glamorous setting. Alas, both films were an embarrassment to the original series. Not enough happened in the movies to warrant anything longer than a 30-minute episode and unfortunately we can never unsee Sarah Jessica Parker and co doing that bizarre slo-mo walk through the desert.The problem with 2015 film Spooks: The Greater Good is that is arrived about 10 years too late. Spooks was a decent BBC drama that ended in 2011 and that\u0027s how it should have stayed.Based on the 1975 series of the same name, this action crime thriller starred Samuel L Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, and Colin Farrell in one of his early box office hits. There was plenty of high-octane drama and Farrell was convincing as a hot-shot cop taking on a French drug lord (Olivier Martinez), but it’s also completely predictable and, ultimately, extremely pointless.An updated version of BBC crime series The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone sounds like something from spoof heaven. The finished film, released in 2012, didn\u0027t really do much to convince anyone that it wasn\u0027t. Sure, Ben Kingsley as The Hood is a great spot of casting, but practically everything else in the film version of Gerry Anderson\u0027s Thunderbirds failed to make the grade. Anderson himself was most damning he called it the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.There are some interesting things in Twilight Zone: The Movie, but it loses points for featuring one of the worst pieces of work from Steven Spielberg: a segment set in a retirement home titled Kick the Can.Just because the Veronica Mars cast and its loyal fans really wanted a movie spin-off to be made, it doesn’t mean it should have ever actually happened. The TV show was revived thanks to funds raised by star Kristen Bell on Kickstarter, but the film was criticised for making literally no sense for anyone who hadn’t watched the series.Famously bad, Wild Wild West was adapted from the 1960s TV show and was the 2000 recipient of the golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.Footage of visitors posing for photos on the staircase has gone viral online, prompting some to express concerns that this would lead to accelerated gentrification in the area.Ocasio-Cortez told\u0026nbspTMZ\u0026nbspthat she was told as a child to be careful when visiting the area where the steps are located.“When I was growing up, everyone would tell us to stay away from those steps or go with a friend,” she said, adding: “The Bronx is much safer now and I’m happy to say that.”The staircase\u0026nbspfeatures prominently in the film’s promotional materials and serves as a backdrop for a key\u0026nbspscene in\u0026nbspJoker, during which Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is seen dancing on the steps.In real life, it is located in the neighbourhood of Highbridge, where it is tucked away between two avenues.The steps are one\u0026nbspexample of “step streets” created in New York City to allow pedestrians to circulate in areas too hilly for motorised transportation.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But a line in “The 21-Second Excitation”, the eighth episode in the sitcom’s fourth season, suggests the two characters might have met much earlier than that.Sheldon, frustrated that his friends don’t want to start lining up at 5pm for a midnight movie, asks Leonard:\u0026nbsp”What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek: Nemesis?”Star Trek: Nemesis, fans might recall, came out in December 2002 in the US, meaning that it’s impossible for Sheldon and Leonard to have met in time to see it together on the day of its release\u0026nbsp(let alone bonded sufficiently to wait 14 hours in line together).The Big Bang Theory\u0026nbspwrapped up in May This year after 12 seasons, but fans are still revisiting some of the show’s earlier episodes.Another fan recently spotted a plot hole in the sitcom’s first season concerning Howard’s parents.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

US prosecutors unveiled the charges in the past week, piggy-backing on similar actions taken in France and the UK in recent years. Taken together, it’s a dramatic assault on a network of bankers and traders operating on both sides of the Atlantic who allegedly reaped tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits.And yet more is likely to come. It’s unclear from the US complaints who, if anyone, is the mastermind behind the scheme. One trader in Switzerland, who hasn’t been charged, appears in multiple indictments, but isn’t identified.While the profits were allegedly big and the scheme expansive, the basics were relatively simple.Investment bankers got information about pending mergers and acquisitions at work, according to the US Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They then sold the information to middlemen, who passed it on to traders. The bankers were repaid with cash, expensive holidays, luxury watches and other benefits, according to court filings.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Liberal leader and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau waves to supporters beside his wife Sophie after the federal election at the Palais des Congres in Montreal.

To further cover their tracks, the insiders traded using derivatives that are illegal in the US and hard to track by regulators.For example, the group traded in shares of Onyx Pharmaceuticals and Omnicare – among more than a dozen other companies – using so-called contracts for difference (CFDs), which allow investors to make big bets with just a small down payment.At the same time, members of the ring tipped off financial news organisations, including Bloomberg News, hoping to benefit from a pop in the stock price when reporters independently corroborated the information and published the news.Among the “Ocean’s Eleven” crew is George Nikas, a Greek who remains at large in his home country. He allegedly placed most of his trades using CFDs.The 54-year-old has businesses in Europe and the US, including GRK Fresh, a New York chain of Greek fast-food restaurants. Prosecutors say he got information from Bryan Cohen, a Goldman Sachs vice-president in New York. While at one of Mr Nikas’s restaurants, Mr Cohen, 33, would get information about pending takeovers by using his burner phones and would then tell Mr Nikas about deals like one tied to Buffalo Wild Wings, according to prosecutors. Mr Cohen pleaded not guilty in a Manhattan court on Tuesday.Mr Nikas allegedly had another source of intel: Telemaque Lavidas, 38, a fellow Greek, whose father was on the board of Ariad Pharmaceuticals. From his father, Mr Lavidas picked up tips about Ariad having to halt clinical trials or being in talks to sell and fed them to Mr Nikas, who made millions of dollars trading on the information, prosecutors say. Mr Lavidas was arrested in New York and has asked to be freed on bail, claiming his role in the conspiracy was “relatively small”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr El-Khouri allegedly traded on inside information obtained from the two London bankers: Benjamin Taylor, 35, who worked at Moelis \u0026amp Co and Darina Windsor, 32, who was at Centerview Partners.For a while the two bankers shared an apartment in London, were romantically involved and called each other Pops and Popsy in messages. For example, in October 2012 Ms Windsor sent an email to Mr Taylor titled “Once upon a time, there was a Pops searching for Truffles in the Forest...”, according to the indictment. Confidential information was allegedly attached to the email.They were paid at least $1m (£778,000) in cash and other benefits, according to the prosecutors. Now, Mr Taylor is in France and Ms Windsor is in her native Thailand, prosecutors said.Mr El-Khouri received tips from Mr Taylor and Ms Windsor through a friend and sent gifts back in return, knowing they would be given to the couple, prosecutors said.Mr Taylor passed price-sensitive information for 16 transactions related to US stocks that he and Ms Windsor got at work, which was passed on to a network of traders in Switzerland and London, prosecutors said.In one January 2013 deal, Mr Taylor accessed confidential merger details regarding Life Technologies, even though he wasn’t assigned to the project. Mr Taylor passed those documents to an unnamed trader who then either directly or indirectly sent them to a reporter at a Canadian newspaper, the SEC said. Days later, the outlet published that Life Technologies was exploring a sale, sending its shares soaring.Mr Lavidas’s lawyer Reed Smith points out in his bail request that the statute of limitations may have run out on some of the crimes. The statute of limitations for wire fraud is five years, unless it affects a financial institution –\u0026nbspthen it’s 10 years.“Two of the nine counts against Mr Lavidas are likely time-barred as they are for wire fraud activities that allegedly occurred in 2013,” Mr Smith wrote.US Securities and Exchange Commission\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It states that you are entitled to services to be carried out with reasonable skill and care.If they aren’t, you may claim a full refund for the time you were unable to use your phone as a result of the outage. When you break it down, it’s probably not huge amounts, unless you’re paying a crazy amount of money for your contract.The key thing to remember is that you’re also entitled to redress for any out-of-pocket expenses you incurred as a direct consequence of being unable to use any of your phone’s usual functionality.\u0026nbspFor example, if you had to use a payphone to make calls, the cost of those calls could be the subject of a refund. But it may also cover your costs if you incurred bank charges because you couldn’t transfer money.Keep a detailed note of what impact the loss of functionality had, including the times, actions and direct financial consequences and then once the system is working again calculate your losses.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued.

US prosecutors unveiled the charges in the past week, piggy-backing on similar actions taken in France and the UK in recent years. Taken together, it’s a dramatic assault on a network of bankers and traders operating on both sides of the Atlantic who allegedly reaped tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits.And yet more is likely to come. It’s unclear from the US complaints who, if anyone, is the mastermind behind the scheme. One trader in Switzerland, who hasn’t been charged, appears in multiple indictments, but isn’t identified.While the profits were allegedly big and the scheme expansive, the basics were relatively simple.Investment bankers got information about pending mergers and acquisitions at work, according to the US Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They then sold the information to middlemen, who passed it on to traders. The bankers were repaid with cash, expensive holidays, luxury watches and other benefits, according to court filings.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Liberal leader and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau waves to supporters beside his wife Sophie after the federal election at the Palais des Congres in Montreal.

Police had earlier fired rubber bullets as they struggled to stop looters who targeted businesses as unrest broke out in several spots in and around the cityThe ring had access to dozens of insider tips and used in-person meetings and “burner” cell phones to avoid detection. To further cover their tracks, the insiders traded using derivatives that are illegal in the US and hard to track by regulators.For example, the group traded in shares of Onyx Pharmaceuticals and Omnicare – among more than a dozen other companies – using so-called contracts for difference (CFDs), which allow investors to make big bets with just a small down payment.At the same time, members of the ring tipped off financial news organisations, including Bloomberg News, hoping to benefit from a pop in the stock price when reporters independently corroborated the information and published the news.Among the “Ocean’s Eleven” crew is George Nikas, a Greek who remains at large in his home country. He allegedly placed most of his trades using CFDs.The 54-year-old has businesses in Europe and the US, including GRK Fresh, a New York chain of Greek fast-food restaurants. Prosecutors say he got information from Bryan Cohen, a Goldman Sachs vice-president in New York. While at one of Mr Nikas’s restaurants, Mr Cohen, 33, would get information about pending takeovers by using his burner phones and would then tell Mr Nikas about deals like one tied to Buffalo Wild Wings, according to prosecutors. Mr Cohen pleaded not guilty in a Manhattan court on Tuesday.Mr Nikas allegedly had another source of intel: Telemaque Lavidas, 38, a fellow Greek, whose father was on the board of Ariad Pharmaceuticals. From his father, Mr Lavidas picked up tips about Ariad having to halt clinical trials or being in talks to sell and fed them to Mr Nikas, who made millions of dollars trading on the information, prosecutors say. Mr Lavidas was arrested in New York and has asked to be freed on bail, claiming his role in the conspiracy was “relatively small”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPops and PopsyThe poker-playing securities trader, Joseph El-Khouri, 52, was arrested by police in the UK on Monday. Mr El-Khouri allegedly traded on inside information obtained from the two London bankers: Benjamin Taylor, 35, who worked at Moelis \u0026amp Co and Darina Windsor, 32, who was at Centerview Partners.For a while the two bankers shared an apartment in London, were romantically involved and called each other Pops and Popsy in messages. For example, in October 2012 Ms Windsor sent an email to Mr Taylor titled “Once upon a time, there was a Pops searching for Truffles in the Forest...”, according to the indictment. Confidential information was allegedly attached to the email.They were paid at least $1m (£778,000) in cash and other benefits, according to the prosecutors. Now, Mr Taylor is in France and Ms Windsor is in her native Thailand, prosecutors said.Mr El-Khouri received tips from Mr Taylor and Ms Windsor through a friend and sent gifts back in return, knowing they would be given to the couple, prosecutors said.Mr Taylor passed price-sensitive information for 16 transactions related to US stocks that he and Ms Windsor got at work, which was passed on to a network of traders in Switzerland and London, prosecutors said.In one January 2013 deal, Mr Taylor accessed confidential merger details regarding Life Technologies, even though he wasn’t assigned to the project. Mr Taylor passed those documents to an unnamed trader who then either directly or indirectly sent them to a reporter at a Canadian newspaper, the SEC said. Days later, the outlet published that Life Technologies was exploring a sale, sending its shares soaring.Mr Lavidas’s lawyer Reed Smith points out in his bail request that the statute of limitations may have run out on some of the crimes.

Quantum computers are theoretically capable of doing work much\u0026nbspquicker than the computers we use today.IBM researchers have already criticised Google’s claims of a breakthrough, suggesting that the new discovery is not as profound as promised. But the new research has finally been published in the journal\u0026nbspNature, and lays out the workings of the long-rumoured breakthrough.The Google researchers state in the paper that their computer, known as Sycamore, is able to conduct a task in 200 seconds that would take around 10,000 years on a traditional system.Created with Sketch.Scientists claim to have achieved quantum supremacy Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realisation of quantum supremacy for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm,” the researchers write in the paper.‘Quantum apocalypse’: How super computers could cripple governmentsThe task used by Google researchers to test their system is largely useless for now, and its main function is to generate random numbers. But it is the first time that any task of this kind has ever been successfully demonstrated, and could very soon lead to more practical applications, the researchers claim.“As a result of these developments, quantum computing is transitioning from a research topic to a technology that unlocks new computational capabilities,” the researchers conclude. “We are only one creative algorithm away from valuable near-term applications.”The company now hopes to build a system that can conduct more broad operations, which could be used across a variety of different fields.“Such a device promises a number of valuable applications,” the researchers wrote in a blog post. “For example, we can envision quantum computing helping to design new materials –\u0026nbsplightweight batteries for cars and airplanes, new catalysts that can produce fertilizer more efficiently (a process that today produces over 2 per cent\u0026nbspof the world’s carbon emissions), and more effective medicines.“Achieving the necessary computational capabilities will still require years of hard engineering and scientific work. But we see a path clearly now, and we’re eager to move ahead.”Google’s breakthrough had been rumoured since an early version of the paper was leaked online last month.\u0026nbspIt had already been criticised by IBM, who argued that the paper was fundamentally flawed because Google had drastically overestimated the difficulty of the task and how long it would take on a classical computer. The task would actually take about 2.5 days on a classical\u0026nbspcomputer and would be completed more effectively than it was with Google’s quantum computer, the firm argued in a blog post\u0026nbsppublished two days before the\u0026nbspNature paper was made available, though it is yet to demonstrate the claim.The phrase “quantum supremacy” has also attracted criticism, both for its similarity to white supremacy and the fact it could encourage hyped-up reporting on the status of quantum technology. Both of those arguments were addressed by John Preskill, the scientist who coined the phrase in 2012, in a recent article where he concluded that Google’s breakthrough is nonetheless very significant.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Though quantum computing could bring profound new processing power to the world, it is also incredibly complicated both to understand and to test.The milestone is revealed in a new paper that has been long-rumoured but is now finally published in the prestigious journal\u0026nbspNature. And the world is finally scrutinising what exactly Google means by quantum supremacy, whether its claim stand up – and what happens now.Here is everything you need to know about the breakthrough.The phrase, first coined in 2012, refers to something very specific but a little complicated to define. It is the moment at which a quantum computer is able to do something that a classical computer could not.Reaching that point would be significant because it would seem to prove the promise that scientists have been making for decades: that an entirely new kind of computer could be created that would allow for wholly fresh – and vastly improved – ways of dealing with data. That, in turn, could revolutionise the world.Created with Sketch.Scientists claim to have achieved quantum supremacy Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.\u0026nbspBut it is important to note that it is also only a milestone: the real journey is much longer, and there is an awful lot left to do. Scientists are excited about the possibility of achieving quantum supremacy because of what it means about the process of creating really useful quantum computers, not necessarily as an end in itself.The phrase is also disputed for many reasons. Researchers including John Preskill, who first coined the phrase, have noted that it can give unnecessary hype around our understanding of quantum computers, and that it has an unfortunate echo of white supremacy.What\u0027s more, the very importance of the test is disputed, too. That\u0027s in part because it is difficult\u0026nbspto say exactly when quantum supremacy has been reached, because researchers could discover that any given process was actually possible to complete on a classical computer all along.To understand how a quantum computer works, it\u0027s important first to understand how a traditional one works. Everything from the phone in your pocket to the computer in your desk – and all the other places that computers appear – do so using the paradigm of classic computing, which has stayed strong for years but which quantum computers could compete with, if not displace.In a traditional computer, everything in the memory is represented as a series of bits, which work as a binary system: they are either 1 or 0, on or off. Those bits can be assembled into the vast and complex information processing systems that we use every day, by stringing them together and analysing the data they together represent.A quantum computer works instead with qubits, not bits – they are no longer binary, but instead can be in a number of different states. By exploiting the unusual behaviour described in quantum mechanics, scientists are able to build quantum computers, which operate at that more complex and therefore more powerful level.Just as in a traditional computer, those qubits can be assembled into a system and used to carry out operations. In a quantum computer, that is made up of a series of quantum gates, which can in turn be assembled into a quantum circuit.That – or a vastly longer, almost impossibly more complex version of that –\u0026nbspis how we get to a quantum computer, which is able to exploit those various strange phenomena and use them to run operations.Theoretically, those quantum computers and their entirely new paradigm should allow scientists to conduct those operations more quickly and in new ways. It\u0027s that which leads us to quantum superiority – and to the variety of other possibilities that lie after it.Google\u0027s great achievement – and it is certainly not the only company to try – is to boil down that complexity into a functioning quantum computer. The successful chip wasn\u0027t the first of Google\u0027s experiments, and there are more likely to come or probably already being used already, but it is the one that will go down in history as perhaps achieving the first great landmark in quantum computing.The Sycamore chip is a 54-qubit processor. That is relatively limited, and is one of the many reasons that the discovery is not practically useful – researchers want a 100-qubit or even 200-qubit system before they are really able to put it to the test, and see whether the dreams of quantum computing are realised.But the big breakthrough is just how high-fidelity and fast the gates that make up the computer are. Scientists have lauded the precision with which the system works, and it is that which allowed Google to make its announcement.The actual process that it did to prove its quantum supremacy was relatively simple in output: it just gave out random numbers. But it was the workings behind it that were such a breakthrough, since it used an algorithm that would take 10,000 years to give a similar output on a classical computer, but only 200 seconds on Google\u0027s Sycamore.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They went on to find the places in the universe where these are found – with the exception of one.This is the final stage of a decades-long chase to pin down the origin of the elements, said\u0026nbspthe study\u0027s lead author Darach Watson from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.We know now that the processes that created the elements happened mostly in ordinary stars, in supernova explosions, or in the outer layers of old stars. But, until now, we did not know the location of the final, undiscovered process, known as rapid neutron capture, that created the heavier elements in the periodic table.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe element that researchers saw being formed, strontium, is found naturally in the soil.

When they did, telescopes around the world turned towards its source: named\u0026nbspGW170817, it was a neutron star merger deep in space.If heavier elements were created when neutron stars collided, scientists thought they would be able to see evidence of them in\u0026nbspkilonovae, which are left behind from those mergers.It was looking in data taken at that time that researchers spotted the elements that were left behind.By reanalysing the 2017 data from the merger, we have now identified the signature of one heavy element in this fireball, strontium, proving that the collision of neutron stars creates this element in the Universe, said Watson.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It states that you are entitled to services to be carried out with reasonable skill and care.If they aren’t, you may claim a full refund for the time you were unable to use your phone as a result of the outage. When you break it down, it’s probably not huge amounts, unless you’re paying a crazy amount of money for your contract.The key thing to remember is that you’re also entitled to redress for any out-of-pocket expenses you incurred as a direct consequence of being unable to use any of your phone’s usual functionality.\u0026nbspFor example, if you had to use a payphone to make calls, the cost of those calls could be the subject of a refund. But it may also cover your costs if you incurred bank charges because you couldn’t transfer money.Keep a detailed note of what impact the loss of functionality had, including the times, actions and direct financial consequences and then once the system is working again calculate your losses.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I did report it and made my feelings clear. There were rooms facing on to the pool so there was no respite for these poor animals.“We walked along one night just to see if we could hear them and were stunned when the security guard was going to let us in. He gestured that he would tap the water and they would come. Of course we declined and again left in tears for these poor animals.”Dolphins’ trauma after being hunted for marine parks revealedDolphinariums say they invest in conservation, but the amount spent is often less than 1 per cent of profit, and dolphins bred in captivity are never released into the wild, WAP claimed.Nick Stewart, of WAP, described the industry as “sinister”, saying: “Dolphins being used as live surfboards, facing large crowds of people day in, day out with loud music and cheering, and enduring a never-ending stream of tourists seeking that perfect selfie is not education, nor is it humane entertainment. \u0026nbsp“Whether bred in captivity or captured from the wild by being torn from their mother’s side, these sociable, intelligent animals are imprisoned for life and are reduced to begging clowns performing circus tricks.“We need to make this the last generation of dolphins in captivity.\u0026nbspThe greedy dolphinarium industry has spun a web of lies, portraying themselves as carers, not captors.”In the wild dolphins swim in at least 100sq km of ocean, but in tiny barren tanks they may self-mutilate from stress, Mr Stewart said. \u0026nbspWe need to make this the last generation of dolphins in captivityAn Expedia spokesperson said the company\u0026nbsphad\u0026nbsptaken steps to remove certain wildlife interactions from its sites both in reaction to “questionable and unsafe” practices but also to feedback from travellers.“And as this cannot be done alone, we continue to work with five global, industry-leading wildlife and animal protection groups to grow our wildlife tourism education portal,” the statement said. “We are grateful for the close coordination with these organisations and our goal for the wildlife tourism education portal is to help better inform travellers about animal welfare and wildlife tourism.“The portal includes information as to whether an activity involves animal interactions, with a direct link to learn more about wildlife tourism and animal welfare and broader education around animal welfare and links to participate in the conversation and take action if a traveller is interested.”The findings came on the day that WWF revealed the development of dams and illegal gold mining that uses mercury are threatening the survival of river dolphins in the Amazon.All samples taken from mammals with satellite tags had high levels of mercury, which pollutes waterways and threatens species, WWF said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Brexit\u0026nbspday have been thrown into doubt after MPs\u0026nbspderailed Boris Johnson\u0027s chances of fast-tracking his deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament by Halloween.Sajid Javid, the chancellor, announced plans for new coins to mark Brexit\u0026nbspearlier this year – shortly before Mr Johnson\u0026nbspwon the Conservative leadership contest – following enthusiastic calls\u0026nbspfrom Conservative MPs.But with the prime minister’s Brexit timetable in doubt, and the UK awaiting a verdict from the EU on the length of a third extension, the Treasury refused to confirm whether production had begun on the first tranche of\u0026nbspcoins.The confusion came after it emerged\u0026nbspthat three million of the coins were to be imprinted with the Brexit date of 31 October and ready to spend by the end of the month.Activists threaten to boycott Brexit 50p coin as Javid draws up plansTreasury sources told the Daily  that the coins had to be approved at the privy council so the coins had legal tender status for when it is introduced on the day we leave.One source said: Three million will be ready for exit day and 10 million will be struck within the first year.The new 50p pieces\u0026nbspwere due to be emblazoned with the words “peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations” and the\u0026nbsp31 October date of the UK\u0027s anticipated departure from the EU.A further seven million were then due to be minted over the course of year – considerably more than the 10,000 commemorative coins planned by Mr Javid’s predecessor,\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond.The Royal Mint regularly issues commemorative currency, with notable coins minted in honour of\u0026nbspthe 2012 London Olympics.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from Final Say Brexit march Show all 76Created

pencilled in for 6 November to set out ambitious plans for infrastructure spending to keep the economy going in the aftermath of Brexit.But Downing Street said his plans may have to be put on hold if the Brexit process is extended, or if the UK crashes out without a deal on 31 October.Mr Javid is understood to have ruled out using the annual statement to unveil major tax giveaways, including Mr Johnson’s £8 billion pledge to cut the bills of those earning more than £50,000 a year.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from Final Say Brexit march Show all 76Created with Sketch.Created with

additional long-term capital projects to the £13.4 billion of extra spending set out in September’s spending review.Announcing the budget date last week, the chancellor made clear that the timing was dependent on the UK leaving the EU with a deal on Halloween.Boris Johnson accused of ‘misleading parliament’ over NI border checksCorbyn is running out of excuses – we’re heading for an electionUK should pay £39bn bill even if it leaves EU without deal- reportBrexit has become a dangerous game of the ‘prisoners’ dilemma’In the case of a no-deal outcome, the government would priorities swift action to support the economy, business and households, and the formal budget announcement would be pushed back by some weeks as official economic forecasters draw up new predictions for the public finances.Mr Johnson’s official spokesman made clear that the 6 November date would not necessarily be scrapped if the EU offers a Brexit extension.But he said: “The budget announcement was working towards a scenario in which we would leave the EU with a deal on 31 October, which is still what we are trying to achieve.“If, because that process has been frustrated by parliament, that is no longer possible, we will have to update you closer to the time.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Neither were they\u0026nbspable to strike a unity government deal with Blue and White – who refuse to work with the incumbent premier as he faces likely indictment charges.It is unclear if Mr Gantz will fare any better. His\u0026nbsponly hope is to form a coalition with the Likud, who continue to stick by their leader.Israel PM Netanyahu admits he cannot form governmentShortly after the ceremony Mr Gantz vowed to establish a “liberal unity government”.\u0026nbsp“The government that I will establish will serve all citizens of Israel and will benefit all citizens of Israel,” he said in a statement.\u0026nbsp“In our home, the state of Israel, there is room for all segments of Israeli society,” he added.Likud agreed to meet Blue and White negotiators shortly afterwards but, in a tweet, hinted the party would not depart from a demand for\u0026nbspa power-sharing deal between Mr Gantz, his fellow party leaders and Mr Netanyahu.Blue and White released a flurry of requests to meet party negotiators, some of which were approved.

And I think I really tried to adopt the British sensibility of a stf upper lip.“I’ve tried but I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging.“I never thought this would be easy. But I thought it would be fair and that’s the part that’s really hard to reconcile.“But I do just take each day as it comes.”Harry admitted he and brother Wills have grown apart — saying: “We’re certainly on dferent paths.”He added: “As brothers, you have good days, you have bad days.”Harry said the pressure on the royals means “inevitably stuff happens”.He continued: “But look, we’re brothers, we’ll always be brothers — and we’re certainly on dferent paths at the moment.But I’ll certainly always be there for him as I know he’ll always be there for me.Harry was askedhe worried whether Meghan may face the same pressures as his mum, the late Princess Diana, who died in  in a car crash in Paris.He said: I will always protect my family, and now I have a family to protect.So everything that she [Diana] went through, and what happened to her, is incredibly important every single day, and that is not me being paranoid, that is just me not wanting a repeat of the past.He said: I thought I was out of the woods and then suddenly it all came back, and this is something that I have to manage.Part of this job is putting on a brave face but, for me and my we, there is a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More than  per cent of voters in my mining villages voted Leave in .”She concluded rightly that the public “feel MPs should work together to resolve Brexit” instead of “slugging it out.”Her attacks at the weekend on the anti-Brexit brigade are part of a consistent pattern since , driven by her belief that the will of the British people must be fulfilled.Her approach is all the more potent because she actually voted Remain in the referendum.But, unlike too many other Remainers in Parliament, she accepted the verdict and has battled to make Brexit work.In that quest, she has had no time for the Parliamentary shenanigans and legalistic manoeuvres that have dominated the withdrawal process, with MPs always “kicking the issue down the road.”Nor, in contrast to most of Labour, does she favour membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, which she said in  would represent “staying in the EU in all but name.”For her principled stand, she has been viciously condemned by others on the left, who have called her a Tory, a turncoat and a traitor.With typical fortitude she has shown no signs of buckling.“I was not elected to Parliament to bow to threats and intimidation. I won’t now,” she says.The charge of treachery is absurd, given that she is abiding by Labour’s  manesto.Moreover, she has devoted most of her adult le to the party.Caroline Flint in  - shes been a Labour MP for  yearsHer warm but steely confidence is a reflection of her tough working-class upbringing.Her deprived background is very dferent from the worlds of privilege inhabited by so many of the affluent liberal Remainers.She was born in  in a home for unmarried mothers in London, the daughter of a -year-old typist Wendy Beasley who later died of alcohol-related liver problems.Flint never knew her biological father.At the age of two, she was adopted by a couple who lived in a one bedroom flat.“My sister and I slept on one side and my parents on the other,” she later recalled of her childhood.Her adoptive parents split up when she was .Her dficulties continued into her young adulthood.Though she was the first member of her family to go to university, she embarked in  on a disastrous marriage to Saief Zammel, a Tunisian stockbroker, by whom she had two children.The marriage fell apart after a series of incidents, including Zammel’s arrest on charges of violent disorder.He was eventually deported from Britain, and Flint was left to bring up their children alone.These were hard times, during which she was turned down for a job at Woolworth’s.But she turned her le around, partly through her involvement with the Labour movement.An MP for  years, she has been a card-carrying Labour member for  years, since she first joined when she was just .Before she was elected to the Commons, she worked as an official for the GMB trade union.“She has more integrity in her little finger than many in that place,” says her fellow Labour MP Laura Smith, referring to the barrage of criticism Flint has endured in Parliament.Despite the fury from the pro-EU mob, she seems to have her Don Valley constituency behind her, precisely because she represents its views.“I think she’s wonderful, absolutely wonderful. She has listened to her constituents, it’s as simple as that,” said Bob Davis, an engineer.Flint was reelected by her constituency Labour party last week, after a petition to throw her out got just  signatures.Part of the admiration for her stems from her capacity – as she has shown over Brexit – to speak her own mind, instead of meekly following the trendy left-wing orthodoxy.So while others in her party wailed about Tory benefit cuts, she attacked the culture of welfare dependency, where claimants expected something for nothing.Given her experience, it is a travesty to pretend she is some kind of anti-Labour hack.With her roots in the working-class, she is far more in touch with ordinary people that most posturing, preening Remainers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At the very least I think she should have been given a break when she was pregnant.I particularly feel for her about her relationship with her dad and her family as that must be hard to deal with in itself, and even worse when every communication she attempts to have with her family is all over every newspaper.For me she has done nothing wrong but seems to get a lot more bad press than Kate.In the clip where she says she’s struggling, I think the sadness in her eyes says everything.PR expert and dad-of-three Anthony Burr, , of Burr Media, lives in London. He says:Sacrices are expected from any royal and once you enter what we term ‘public le’ it is just that – you live your le in the public view.Meghan was being as open and as candid as we have seen any royal, possibly since Diana. Yet as a Royal there is protocol and there is a duty to protect the Queen and the realm.Meghan has to strike that balance.It is possible to sacrice parts of your privacy whilst also keeping other parts private. William and Kate are striking that balance perfectly.The problem with being too candid is you leave yourself open to enemies. As a dad, I will ask my girls to decide carefully when and who you should be open with.It’s not easy for Meghan, and it will take some time but she can bridge that gap between celebrity and royal andshe gets it right then she can be an icon for years to come.His daughter Tatjana Mager-Burr, , is a Year  student.She says: Its a democratic country. Meghan and Harry should be able to speak their minds.How open they should be really depends on the situation. [Perhaps not]Meghans having arguments with Harry... you dont want the royal family to be viewed as falling apart.Its unusual for royals to come clean about their situation - they usually stay reserved. I feel [this documentary] could be a way of opening up attitudes towards the royals.Biba Tanya, , is a blogger from Ribble Valley in Lancashire.She says: It’s the ‘poor me’ attitude that I just think is absurd. What was the quote  ‘We’re existing but not living’  Are you f*****g joking me There are people using food banks who are existing and not living, sweetheart, not people who are flying private jets to their baby showers. That’s not living, that’s living in style. Her line ‘thank you so much for asking’ - it’s pathetic! I got an A* in Drama Megan, I’m probably about as talented as you are!Harry threw a royal tantrum a few days ago when he was asked a rogue question by a reporter. It was a perfectly reasonable question and he completely flipped his lid.William is more of an example. He doesn’t complain at least. It’s the complaining that everyone’s finding unbearable. It does make me smile when I see that Kate’s handling this with such aplomb. Shes never complained once – she just cracks on.Who are you  You’re just these mythical creatures who live off our money without letting us know what you’re truly thinking.I once went on GMB and publicly declared that I don’t vaccinate my children – you want to see the trolling that I got. I’m a big girl – I pulled my big girl pants up and got on with it! What are they upset about Her son Sebastian Haywood is .He says: Meghans finding it hard being in the limelight as a member of the royal family, especially since she was raised like an average child and isn’t used to this.They stated that they only feel happy in Africa and don’t like being in the limelight. If they feel that it’s best for them to leave the royal family and go to Africa then they should go.Also Meghan is facing the pressure of being in the spotlight plus the hardship of being a new mother. She also has the social pressure put on her by the media always expecting her to put on a smile and act like everything is okay.School safeguarding head Jane Baldwin lives in Kent.She says: I think in their position they are a representation of our country and should not air their dirty laundry in public.I also believe in these dficult political times, when people are facing job loss etc, moaning about media coverage - which I might add is what charities need and is the purpose of their tour and not forgetting Meghan’s movie career thrived on this - is not appropriate.I have always thought Harry tried to be in touch with us common folk, following his mums approach. However this recent documentary just highlighted the disconnect between the le they lead and what his people would consider real le issues, like paying a mortgage and having a job.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Meghan is struggling with le as a new motherand the global attention that comes with joining the “The Firm”. And Harry wants to protect her.But their latest complaints seemed poorly timed and worryingly self-indulgent. How  can you describe the royal couple seeing impoverished young African girls learning to box so they can fight off sexual predators, then using air time to address their First World problems with the media The same media, I might add, that was praising Meghan’s obvious intelligence and charm and had hitherto featured glowing reports from their first official overseas tour together.Prince William is reportedly “worried” about his brother’s state of mind, and after watching the documentary Harry  Meghan: An African Journey, one could only agree and conclude that we’re seeing a man teetering on the edge.The rampant paranoia, the relentless victim narrative and a tendency towards the dramatic are all perhaps signs that Harry does indeed need to take a break from public le before he unravels even further.But during that respite, he must surely seek specialist help and ask himself this: Is his obvious angst really just down to the media occasionally writing inconvenient truths about his we’s fractured family and questioning the couple’s obvious hypocrisy at using private jets while preaching about climate change OR is it the result of unresolved issues surrounding his mother Diana’s untimely death  My money’s on the latter, not least because Harry’s escalating rhetoric around the “safety of my family” rang alarm bells with me.As a child, my husband witnessed the accidental death of his -month- old brother and was put in the ambulance with his screaming mother. When he was , his -year- old father died suddenly at home during an afternoon nap.Both were deeply traumatic events that, by the time we met in , he thought he’d dealt with. But, in late , the birth of our daughter triggered a delayed response and he became riven with anxiety that something might happen to her.He developed the now resolved habit of what psychiatrist’s might refer to as “catastrophising” where, in his mind, a cut finger would escalate to potential sepsis and, like  Harry, “the safety of my ­family”  was an oft repeated mantra to try to  quash rational debate.Put simply, he felt a loss of ­control over what happened to his brother and father, which then manested itself in a disproportionately dramatic reaction to even the simplest of le’s problems and an inability to see past them.So I can only wonder whether the birth of his son Archie has triggered the same powerful reaction in Harry, who admits he thought he was out of the woods with his mental health, “but suddenly it all came back.” It would certainly explain his tears at the recent WellChild Awards, where his speech centred on his and Meghan’s feelings since having achild rather than focusing on the stories of those being celebrated.And it was “the safety of my family” he used to explain the use of private jets when, just a few days later, William and Kate — the future King and Queen of Britain — quietly boarded a commercial flight to Scotland with their kids and the dference in attitudes was there for all to see.Both William and Harry suffered the untimely loss of their mother and — wrongly, to my mind — faced the intolerable pressure of having to walk behind her coffin while the world looked on.BUT as William has clearly learned toaround the trauma and get on with his le in a mature and rational way, Harry still seems troubled, angry and prone to irrational outbursts.“I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum,” he declared to interviewer and friend Tom Bradby.The tragic sequence of events that led to the death of his mother were going to the Paris Ritz with an international playboy, deciding to leave the safety of their hotel suite at midnight when they knew there were motorbike paps outside, unwittingly getting into a car driven by someone well over the drink-drive limit and not wearing a seatbelt.So yes, the paparazzi followed the carand, in an ideal world, they wouldn’t have.But a French inquiry cleared the bikes of involvement in the crash and, in the real world, anyone famous knows thatyou don’t want to be “papped” you live your le accordingly by maintaining a low profile and avoiding celebrity hang-outs.The Cambridges know that ­living a quiet, unremarkable le is the greatest antidote to unwanted media attention but also accept that the trade-off for the privilege le of being royal is that, ­occasionally, there will be “off message” stories and opinions they don’t like.On the South Africa tour, tetchy Prince Harry behaved like an entitled elite when he chastised Sky’s invited royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills for asking him a perfectly anodyne question about his visit.Later, while reporting from William and Kate’s hugely successful tour of Pakistan, Rhiannon praised the Cambridges for their regular and friendly interactions with the media.She observes that they clearly understand that official duty for Queen and country come first.“Compare it with the tone of the end of Prince Harry and Meghan’s tour a few weeks ago and you couldn’t have a bigger contrast,” she adds. “Harry had made it all about them by releasing a statement announcing legal action against The Mail on Sunday and criticising the Press.”EQUALLY, it’s worth noting that, like Meghan, Kate also had to adapt to royal le and, despite being mum to three young children, has never publicly complained about her lot.Probably because she understands that there are millions of people in the country with far worse problems and without the support network or finances to cushion the blow.That’s a rational outlook but, right now, Harry is clearly locked in a victim narrative where the nasty Press hunted his mother to her death and even the mildest criticism of him or his we is taken as “bullying” behaviour that threatens their very existence.I feel sympathy for him, but only he can change that self-pitying narrative, with his we’s support. Unfortunately, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have a close-knit family around her and, judging by what she said in the same ­documentary, may be enabling rather than ­calming his paranoia.She said her British friends had warned her off marrying Harry because “the British tabloids will destroy your le.” Really  Or did they rightly just advise that the Press attention would be several notches higher than she’d been used to  Particularly as she has a rather off- message family Certainly not the poor man at Wimbledon who got ticked off by “Meghan’s ­people” for trying to take a photo of her when he was actually taking a selfie.No, it’s definitely time for a ­period of rest and, ­hopefully, reflection.  And , at the end of it, they decide to step away from royal le and live as private citizens, then we wish them nothing but the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris believes in better times.Like Buzz Lightyear he punches the air and cries: “To infinity and beyond!”What do you think when you see Big Ben or a photograph of the twirly-towered Houses of Parliament standing next to the gracious River Thames Most of us, I guess, used to feel a little bounce of patriotism when we heard Big Ben’s bongs.But the bonging has long since ceased to have that effect — indeed, the bongs don’t even sound any more, owing to the repairs being done to the clock tower.The sheer sight of Parliament now, I suspect, fills many voters with feelings of irritation and boredom, and maybe worse.As Bonfire Night approaches, it may never have been easier to sympathise with Guy Fawkes and his gunpowder plotters.This is, please, not an incitement to you all to burrow into the cellars under the Palace of Westminster with barrels of explosives and fizzing fuses.But would it not be tempting to tie a stick or two of dynamite to the tail of Commons Speaker John Bercow Is there not at least a small part of you that would welcome a big, cartoon-style ka-boom in the Commons lavatories and seeing the likes of Hilary Benn and Dominic Grieve QC and Yvette Cooper and Sir Oliver Ruddy Letwin emerging with their faces sooted, their hairdos standing up on end and their trousers round their knocking knees Back in the days of the Soviet Union there was a man called Andrei Gromyko, who was almost a self-parody of grumpiness.Gromyko was foreign minister for the Soviets from - and he undoubtedly had a brilliant mind.Yet there he would stand on the Kremlin’s viewing balcony at the May Day parades, wrapped tight into his smart coat and hat, and his grim, unyielding face said it all.Gromyko wanted no change. He wanted the status quo to last forever.He became known as Mr Nyet. That’s Nyet for No, never forever. Well, the brutal Soviet empire didn’t last for ever, as we now know.Gromyko stood on the wrong side of history. Soviet Marxism was shattered and the Berlin Wall fell.Parliamentary opponents of Brexit will one day be seen to have been similarly obstructive.Like Gromyko, the only answer they have is the negative.It is not because they are stupid. Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer, and that giggling nitwit Letwin, are well-read gents.Hilary Benn is probably brighter than his old man Tony was.Grieve and Anna Soubry are both lawyers, though you might not want them defending you in a big trial in case they got up the jury’s noses with their stone-faced insistence that no one  can possibly ever be right.And then there’s Bercow. The soon-to-depart speaker is a chippy, itchy, batey little piglet and one of the most gloriously public cuckolds of the kingdom but he has a perfectly good brain on him.It’s not lack of cleverness that afflicts them. It is their inability to realise that the public wants hope.Voters crave optimism in their politicians.They want leaders who offer solutions, not dismal shroud-wavers like Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.And after three years of this inertia, the desire for some brightness and happiness has never been keener.That is why Boris is flying in the opinion polls.It may not be that we all like every dotted I and crossed T of his Brexit deal.Plenty of us would have accepted No Deal. It is not that the voters have suddenly become Tories.But they warm to the Johnsonian can-do spirit.When everyone said he would never extract concessions from Brussels, he did.When everyone said he was a shallow joker, he found a statesmanlike tone which hailed European civilisation while embracing British independence.His opponents, lips curling, said he was just a racist, sexist nationalist who would sell out to Donald Trump.Boris crinkled his eyes, spoke up for the NHS and talked of healing and progress.Britain has had enough of the grumps and glumbuckets.Parliament needs to rediscover the miraculous qualities of the words “can” and “yes”.

Civil servants have warned that a later date could force schools to cancel nativity plays to act as polling stations.It means that the next  hours are crucial in how Brexit and a general election plays out.EU ambassadors met last night to try to find a compromise and take stock of the lay of the land.Mr Varadkar has backed a three-month flextension which could be ended earlyMPs ratied the deal before January .But he suggested other leaders disagreed with him, saying: “My bags are always packed for Brussels and packed they are again.”Mrs Merkel also confirmed she would not block another delay, with her spokesman saying it would “not fail due to Germany”.But her country’s foreign minister Heiko Maas said the UK would need to provide assurances it would hold an election to get the full three months.He said: “If it’s a question of pushing Brexit back until the end of January, we’d need to know why. What’s going to happen in the interval and will there be elections in Great Britain ”French President Emmanuel Macron has taken a tougher line still, with his Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin saying the UK should only get a few days to pass the deal.Privately, French officials said the president wanted any extension capped at  days.An EU diplomat told The Sun: “It all hinges on Johnson explaining his plans. If he can’t convince leaders, we’ll need a summit.”Mr Johnson faces a battle to avoid losing on the Queen’s Speech today.He is operating without a majority in the Commons, with just  MPs taking the Conservative whip —  short of the number needed to ensure victory.Losing the Queen’s Speech would traditionally be seen as a no confidence vote and force a PM to quit.Under recent rule changes, the vote is only symbolic — but losing will still be embarrassing.There was also fresh confusion over what checks will be needed between Great Britain and Northern Ireland under the new deal.At PMQs Mr Johnson insisted there would be no checks but this was contradicted by his spokesman and Home Office officials.Border Force Official Paul Lincoln told the Home Affairs committee that minimal electronic submissions would be needed for goods going from Great Britain to Northern ­Ireland.And on Tuesday, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay admitted Northern Irish businesses moving some goods to Great Britain would require exit summary declarations.Tory MP Michael Fabricant stormed: “Jeremy Corbyn knows that he is even less popular than Michael Foot, so is running scared of an election.”MYSTERY surrounds the fate of the p Brexit coins after MPs wrecked the timetable to leave.At least , have reportedly been pressed already, and may be collectors’ items.Though the Queen doing a facepalm, right, would surely be more appropriate.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is totally understandable. But there is a risk to attempting it before delivering Brexit as he promised.There is a danger too, of course, that Remainers will kill his deal in the next fortnight via fatal amendments. Most Labour “moderates” in Leave seats cannot be trusted to back it, however much they hope to pull the wool over their constituents’ eyes.But the PM can then go to the polls promising that a Tory majority will reverse their tricks and finalise his deal.As it stands, Labour must agree to any election. And it is truly jaw-dropping to watch them running away, having screamed for so long for the chance to replace the dastardly Tories.With their ratings in freefall and in mortal fear of Boris’s popularity, they concoct ever more ludicrous excuses to dodge a reckoning. It is shredding the last remnants of their credibility.The public wants an election, by  per cent to . Labour cannot hide from it.They are stricken, ided and handicapped by the most unpopular political leader in UK history — but they will be seen too as snivelling cowards who put their party before their country.For the moment, though, Boris’s best bet is as his slogan says: to get Brexit done.IT is a scandal that the fracking revolution was strangled at birth.The Whitehall report saying it is “years behind schedule” doesn’t nearly cover the failure.Shale gas could power Britain cheaply for a generation, lower bills and create thousands of jobs. It would be far more eco-friendly than burning coal.But the Tories lost the PR war against a green social media campaign which terried the public using debunked and out-of-date US scare stories. Most people know little of fracking except that they are meant to despise and fear it.The Cameron Government could have pushed back hard. Instead it buckled and hit fracking firms with regulations making exploration all but impossible.What a calamitous missed opportunity.IT is impossible to imagine the terrying ordeal of the  migrants who died in a refrigerated truck.And we recoil at the evil and greed of the traffickers who have profited from this appalling tragedy.The only comfort is that there is every chance, from the details already known, that they will be brought to justice.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The road menace was five months into his latest three-year restriction when he was found in his beaten-up L-plate Rover  on April . Ackerman told officers he had been trying to move the car  metres from his driveway to a nearby garage - even though he was disqualied and had no MOT.    In a bizarre police interview, Ackerman accepted he was banned but claimed he simply didnapost care. He said he didnapost give a monkeys about the law, adding: The le Iaposm living is way beyond anything to do with the law. Pauline Lambert, prosecuting, told Swindon Magistratesapos Court Ackerman had ten previous convictions for driving while disqualied.    The latest, in November , saw him jailed after leading police on a chase in Cornwall that only ended when a stinger brought his vehicle to a jolting halt. Ackerman, of Acacia Grove, Swindon, Wilts, pleaded guilty to driving while disqualied, driving without insurance or a MOT. He was given a -month community order, fined £ and had six months added to his driving ban. Chairman of the bench Jane Flew said: You have an appalling history of driving whilst disqualied. You are a menace to other road users because despite y bans, prison sentences and community orders you still meddle with cars and are tempted to get behind the wheel of a car.

Helen and James Hartley, from Lincoln, were traumatised when they discovered pooch Poppyaposs tongue dangling by a thread of flesh. They had left the pooch alone as she played with a rubber ball toy when she got her tongue stuck. The tissue then turned necrotic due to restricted blood flow and Poppy was unable to eat or drink properly. As the injury developed, Helen and James took Poppy to the vets to stitch her tongue back up. Helen wrote: [It was] really traumatic for us all.    Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for looking after Poppy. Sheaposs been so well loved by everybody at the surgery and we couldnapost have asked for a more dedicated team. Well done to you all, Poppy sends sloppy kisses. With Poppy now firmly on the road to recovery, a month after the ordeal, the vets are now sharing what happened to highlight the dangers of leaving any pet unattended with toys.    The couple had ed home from work to discover Poppy had got her tongue stuck in the air hole of a rubber dog ball. After wrestling the ball from her mouth and tongue, they noticed despite seeming bright she was acting strangely so took her to the vets. There, nurses spotted that the front half of Poppyaposs tongue was very swollen and there was a red line showing where the ball had affected the blood flow. Aside from the marking, her tongue was pink and warm to the touch and Poppy was happy to eat treats so was given medication to manage the swelling and booked in for daily check-ups.    Over the course of the week the red line gradually changed into bruising, which started to smell foul and form white plaques on top. This eventually turned necrotic and died, leaving Poppy with two giant slits on either side of her tongue where the ball had been. During surgery all the dead tissue was removed and Poppyaposs tongue was stitched back together. A Foxhall Veterinary Clinic spokesperson said: The surgery was successful and our nurses couldnapost believe it when Poppy ate and drank as soon as she woke up.

Stacey, , says her daughter is still recovering from her experience and had to be treated for burns to her face and neck as well as above her backside.    According to Stacey, Emelia complained to staff twice that her skin was being burned by the slime - but was initially ignored. Stacey told the Mirror: I was in the audience at the back and she was in the slime pit when she called me down. She [Emelia] told stewards twice who didnapost even wash it off. They only gave her blue paper towels and didnapost believe it was burning her.

Lisa Adams, , stayed with husband Steven Adams, , at the hotel in Priory Marina, Bedford, during a trip to visit their grandchildren in September. They paid £ for their one-night stay but, in the morning, gran-of-three Lisa claims she found her legs and lower tummy riddled with itchy and inflamed red bites - a claim the hotel strongly denies.The angry guest reported the problem but says a member of staff promised to investigate after admitting weaposve not had any problems like this for a long time. And six weeks on, Lisa says the bites have become infected and were leaking pus, leaving her feeling itchy all over and like her blood is aposboilingapos inside her.    The grandmother, who herself is a customer service manager, said: I was gobsmacked when the pharmacist I visited said it looked like I had bed bug bites. But Premier Inn said it investigated Lisaaposs complaint but external specialists found no evidence of bed bugs in the room she was allocated. Lisa, of St Austell, Cornwall, continued: I felt a bit dirty with all these red blotches on me. I scrubbed in the shower in case anything was still on me, it didnapost make me feel very nice at all. They were on the front and back of my legs from the ankle to the top of my leg and the bottom of my stomach.    They were very itchy but I didnapost want to scratch them because they already sore and I didnapost want to make them more painful. Weaposve been to Mexico and travelled to Australia, China and lots of dferent places and Iaposve never been bitten by anything. Now I think I might have an infection because my body is itching all over and it feels like my blood is boiling inside me. Lisa, wearing a long pyjama top, got under the duvet and fell asleep after enjoying a meal out with HGV driver Steven. The room looked clean to the naked eye, there were no obvious signs of anything dirty but I didnapost pull back the sheets and check the mattress and the duvet, she said.  When you walk into a hotel you donapost expect to have to check things like that. When we got up my husband said Iaposd been a bit restless in the night - [Iaposm not sure] whether I was conscious that something was happening or whether it was because I was in a strange place. After noticing her wounds, Lisa binned their overnight suitcase and £-worth of clothing in the fear she might take any creepy crawly stowaways with her. Lisa added: The way theyaposve handled the complain is appalling. Given the severity of the bites it needed to be highlighted. If that had been an older person they may not be robust enough to fight the infection as I have, it could have been worse. To be fobbed off the way I was is just not right, I wonapost be staying with Premier Inn again after this.

He said: You allow the intrusive lens into your le, and you are out of control. No matter how much editorial control they had with their mate, Tom Bradby, he’s caused chaos. The royal family are a publicly-funded heritage business, and as anybody that has entered in to it has discovered, the rules go out of the window. Celebrities don’t have the same responsibility, don’t have the love of the nation to deal with.

Max Foster, an anchor and royal correspondent for US news network CNN, said a source close to the Sussexes told him: “The institution around the royal family is full of people afraid of and inexperienced at how to best help harness and deploy the value of the royal couple who, they said, ‘have single-handedly modernised the monarchy’.” There were reports that Prince William didnapost see the programme before it aired, however the Palace refused to comment on this.    A royal source told the Mirror that senior royals are “concerned for the couple”, and said the breakdown in their relationship was desperately sad. They’re going completely separate ways and Harry is the one who seems to be visibly struggling. “It seems the boy who walked behind their mother’s coffin, which is so vividly seared onto the nation’s consciousness, has never fully recovered, which is an utter tragedy. Charles has sought to help the young men, even that hasn’t helped.

The comments were made in response to sources close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex claiming they were dragging the family into the st century.    A senior royal staffer told The Sun: “The Queen, with the support of Prince Philip, turned it from a medieval organisation to a modern one.“ They broadcast the coronation, did the first-ever reality series on TV, opened Buckingham Palace up to the public. Friends of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex recently accused the royal family of not giving them the recognition they deserve. Sources claimed the coupleaposs advisers were incapable of “harnessing their value”.    It followed a row over the couple’s comments in a TV documentary on Sunday, in which they spoke of their “struggle” with le in the public eye. And it came as Meghan, , was seen on Tuesday night for the first time since her and Harryaposs ITV documentary aired, smiling as she attended the One Young World Summit opening ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Max Foster, an anchor and royal correspondent for US news network CNN, said a source close to the Sussexes told him: “The institution around the royal family is full of people afraid of and inexperienced at how to best help harness and deploy the value of the royal couple who, they said, ‘have single-handedly modernised the monarchy’.” The Mirror previously revealed that senior royals believed Harry and Meghan were “in a moment of crisis” after their candid comments aired on Sunday, in a documentary covering their recent tour.

The  en-suite studio pods measuring just xftwere installed last month in response to an increased demand for student accommodation at University of West of England , in Bristol. But they have been branded Purbeck Court appalling and not mentally viable by students living there - some of whom are moving out after just a month. They also claim have other students in nearby halls of residence taunt them for not living in real accommodation.  Other complaints have included there being limited communal space, thin walls, and being overlooked by an existing hall of residence.And the studio pods are costing residents £ per week - whilst campus accommodation ranges from £ to £ per week. First-year history student Joe Oakes-Monger told the BBC he had decided to move out because it was quite isolating to live in a very confined space. He said: Itaposs a strange place to spend quite a large part of your time in. Thereaposs not really anywhere  to go.    At the time [I moved in] I was desperate for accommodation, but I was pretty appalled. I couldnapost quite believe the prospect of spending a year there.He added it was not an appropriate living standard for a human being. And another student, Jack Field, who writes for the universityaposs student magazine, said he had heard complaints the housing fees were too expensive. The university has said it will be evaluating the value for money of the new units.

Jessica Yaniv, who identies as female but has male genitalia, had contacted multiple beauty salon businesses in British Columbia, Canada, requesting waxes. A tribunal heard staff refused to perform the pubic hair removal procedure after she revealed she shad a full set of male genitalia.Yaniv filed complaints against multiple beauty salons - claiming the aestheticians’ refusal to wax her scrotum was discriminatory, reports the Daily Star .   But according the tribunalaposs Tuesday decision, Yanivaposs complaint was not genuine. The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal ruled she had gone on a campaign both to enrich herself at the expense of South Asians, and to punish them for what she viewed as transphobia. Now she has been forced to pay the workers over the case- which saw one forced out of business as a result of Yanivaposs claim. The tribunal said Yaniv had had “manufactured the conditions for a human rights complaint” when she demanded bikini waxes from several salons despite still having a full set of male genitalia. A number of the salon workers voiced religious objections to carrying out the procedures. Others said they weren’t appropriately trained in waxing a scrotum. Because some of the salons in question had never offered services to wax anyone’s scrotum, the tribunal said, it could not be said to be discriminating against Ms Yaniv.    The verdict from the tribunal read: Human rights legislation does not require a service provider to wax a type of genitals they are not trained for and have not consented to wax.” Yaniv, the ruling said, “targeted small businesses, manufactured the conditions for a human rights complaint, and then leveraged that complaint to pursue a financial settlement from parties who were unsophisticated and unlikely to mount a proper defence. The evidence Yaniv herself gave was, according to the tribunal, “disingenuous and self-serving”.    Welcoming the verdict Jay Cameron, a lawyer for the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedomswhich represented five of the respondents in Vancouver targeted by Yaniv, said: “Self-identication does not erase physiological reality. The organisation said its clients were women from a erse range of ethnic backgrounds, including two beauty therapists who belonged to the Sikh faith. Most of the women who were the target of Yaniv’s complaints worked from their own home, are immigrants to Canada, do not have English as a first language, and some have small children with them in the house during the day. The JCCF said its clients had refused to provide the service for reasons including a lack of personal comfort, safety concerns, a lack of training, and in some cases religious objections. Cameron said: “Our clients do not offer the service requested. No woman should be compelled to touch male genitals against her will, irrespective of how the owner of the genitals identies.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man hides street teach girlfriend","story":"NewsMan hides in street to teach girlfriend not to walk home alone and it ends badlyA boyfriend wanted to show his partner what could happen when she walks home in the dark but got it very, very wrongShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  OCT NewsHe wanted to show her how dangerous it is \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

times a year while the rest of the time it’s something  other than a stadium for football – which is obviously most of the time.“We want the football fans to have the best possible time they can, but the other  days, we want everyone  that comes on the site to say ‘this is a great place to be, I want to go back there’.“That’s what we want to happen.”The development and construction of the project itself has been frustrating for Nelms and Dundee owner Tim Keyes, the men behind Dark Blue Property Holdings, which is driving the new stadium plans.In terms of the here and now, Nelms admits development of the project has slowed down.Lending partners have been identied and Nelms is working closely with them to find a way forward.He said: “As soon as we get confirmation of a plan of how financing will work and it works for us, we’ll press the button and all the consultants and everybody are back up to speed.“Gregor Hamiltonis patiently waiting for these documents to come through.“Because it’s so large and has so many dferent parts, our consultants have been working with the council to give them the workings in stages.“That will be based on how we’ve agreed to drop them in and ensure it’s the way they want it done.“In our pre-meetings, which were over a year ago, we met with neighbours and local groups as well as those who had concerns.“All of those things have happened – though it feels like a long, long time ago.”Nelms sees the prospect of bringing the stadium to Dundee, on land next to Dundee Ice Arena, as the next stage of the city’s re-birth.He has watched, since arriving in , the Waterfront development and the city as a whole growing as time goes on.He is sure a new stadium complex will bring in even more tourism.Nelms believes it’s important to build on the positivity surrounding Dundee by helping produce a venue hosting events which would attract people from all around Scotland.“You have to have momentum, you can’t rest on your laurels, you’ve got to build around that and add more to Dundee,” he said.“You want people to spend the night here, spend more money so we have to give them multiple things.“That’s one of our goals. Dundee is on the up and that’s one of the reasons we invested initially. When I first arrived the Waterfront was all rubble, it was hard to see it was a city on the up. But now the Waterfront is fantastic.“The focus can’t just be there, it has to be in the city centre and surrounding areas.“We need to build Dundee into a place where people want to spend more than a couple of hours.”More than  jobs could be created by a new stadium at Camperdown Park.Dundee managing director John Nelms has revealed government predictions suggest Dundonians could benefit from hundreds of jobs thanks to the project.He said: “All of these things, the hotel, the restaurants, the crematorium all bring jobs. “according to government documents, it brings about  full time jobs.#It also brings, over a two-three year period, construction jobs and part-time jobs.#It creates more opportunity for the city and that’s our goal.”Nelms also hopes a new stadium can help bring top music acts to Dundee and help Slessor Gardens to carry the load – as well as a conference centre which can attract , guests.

to Russia in Moscow and beat San Marino - at Hampden in Euro  qualying Group I.To make his Dark Blue bow was a boost, as he had come so close in the past.Reds boss McInnes was thrilled to see Devlin finally win caps for Scotland and hopes his stopper can add to them and establish himself with the national team in the same way as McKenna, his Pittodrie colleague.McKenna missed out on the last squad, having just ed from a hamstring injury, but having made his debut in March of last year, the -year-old has gone on to win  caps and become a mainstay of the Scotland defence.McInnes said of Devlin’s first two Scotland appearances: “It was two games that were in total contrast to each other.“Steve had indicated in conversations with me that he was going to cap Mikey.“It was a dficult start for him against Russia. The team had to pick themselves up from the disappointment when the game ended.“There was the high of getting his first cap, but then the disappointment of how it turned out.“However, the reaction was good from everyone, including Mikey, against San Marino.“I’m sure that lted Mikey, but it also lted the supporters of the Scotland team.“So it was good that Mikey had a convincing win and it was good he got the opportunity to go back into the team again after losing against Russia.“Certainly he came back in last Tuesday feeling good about himself and rightly so.“To get a couple of caps is great and he will see it now as a chance to establish himself in the national team in the way McKenna has done.”Former Hamilton Accies man Devlin was named in Clarke’s previous two squads, in September and June, but didn’t feature in two clashes against Belgium and encounters with Russia and Cyprus.Last season, after a bright start to the campaign with Aberdeen, he looked set to be handed his Scots debut by Gothenburg Great Alex McLeish in the Uefa Nations League double header with Albania and Israel in November.However, a foot injury sustained during training with the national team meant he missed out.That injury ended up keeping Devlin out for three months last season and after he ed to action with the Dons he struggled to recapture his early-season form.McInnes added: “He got injured away with Scotland and after that he really struggled to get any momentum again.“Mikey is someone who is hungry to get more caps and I’m sure the two caps he’s had will help that in terms of trying to get into future squads.”Devlin’s two caps were contrasting encounters.In the first, against Russia, he was up against prolic Zenit St Petersburg striker Artem Dzyuba, who scored twice as Russia thrashed the Scots -.But three days later, at Hampden, Devlin was rarely tested defensively against minnows San Marino.McInnes believes Devlin will feel the benefit of both games in his future development.He said: “Whether you see it immediately or not, I think you always get a benefit from playing with your national team.“Whether it’s a good experience or a bad experience, I think it makes you better.“He’s had to play against Russia and be asked the question a lot by a physical striker and then play against a team in San Marino where he didn’t have a lot to do defensively.“It was more about his use of the ball, which was good, as was his concentration. Mikey has sampled two dferent ends of the spectrum in international football and it’s pleasing he managed to deal with that.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/EE-KF-141019-01-02-450x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet lexi lola and harley are looking for a new home can you help1","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home. vw, px\"  This sweet girl is nine years old.She’s a friendly pup, but being a little older she doesn’t want to live with young children or other dogs or cats.Lexi loves playing with her toys, especially footballs!

It will be held at the Beach Ballroom in Aberdeen on November .She said: “I wanted to do something to mark my twins’ st birthday.“I gave birth to them at  weeks, and they spent three months in the neonatal unit.“We’re going to be having an afternoon tea and a fashion show at the Beach Ballroom, which will feature models who have been in the neonatal unit.“My daughter will also be on the catwalk.”Modelz UK will help Sylvia organise the fashion show.More than  youngsters, parents and even nurses from the neonatal ward will be taking part in the event – all in aid of the charity.A number of brands have also signed up to help clothe the models, including Tiger Lily, New Look, Matalan, John Lewis and Slaters. A similar successful event was held in April .Parents of more than  youngsters who survived against the odds at birth took part in the show to thank the staff who had cared for them.And a total of £, was raised for the Friends of the Neonatal Unit charity, which at that time was known as Friends of the Special Nursery.Some of the children who took part in the first show will be ing to the catwalk for the new event.Sylvia added: “There’s lots of people helping out, and there’s a lot of children who were cared for in the unit taking part. I’ve made many friends along the way and from being a volunteer. It’s a unique kind of fashion show. Everyone’s really happy to be involved.“I think it’s great for a lot of parents to see the bigger kids.“I remember going into the neonatal unit when my kids were about eight or nine.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

Peeblesshire News reporter Hilary Scott joined the hoedown rehearsal last Wednesday and spoke with the cast as they prepared for the upbeat cowboy classic.Rodgers and Hammersteinrsquos collaboration is uniquely adapted for youth performers who are working hard to bring you a rootinrsquo tootinrsquo, chap-slapping show.It comes from the prodigies of Innerleithen Opera, who last year brought the rags to riches tale of orphan Annie to le.The success of their debut performance led to calls for another show, and the young actors from KIYT jumped at the chance to take to the stage again.They are stepping back to a time before any of them were born. Set in the Western Indian Territory just after the turn of the th century, the spirited rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys provides the backdrop for a love story between Curly, a handsome cowboy, and Laurey, a beautul farm girl.But the road to true love is a bumpy one, especially as sinister farm-hand Jud Fry has his sights set on Laurey, and hersquoll do whatever it takes to get her.But Laurey isnrsquot the only girl in Oklahoma with cowboy troubles. Her ditzy friend Ado Annie just loves it when a fella talks purty to her! Shersquos taken up with the Peddler man who doesnrsquot want her.Meanwhile cowboy Will Parker desperately wants the irrepressible Annie to be his bride. But for him its lsquoall of nothinrsquo. However, Ado Annie has just one problem when shersquos with a fella ndash lsquoshe canrsquot say no!rsquoRiding ahead of the herd of romanticised cowboy land is Laureyrsquos wise-cracking Aunt Eller. If anyone can sort out the messy love triangle itrsquos her.As rehearsals get under way in the Library Hall Irsquom at a loose end until I can grab some of the principals for a chat.Deep within this building is the most magical wardrobe, which has been bringing characters to le in many a show performed by Innerleithen and District Operatic Society.Seamstresses Rhona McGlasson and Susan McGinn have been working the needle and thread for more years than they care to remember, but they tell me itrsquos ldquoplaytime to them, and they are often scouring charity shops for bargains.I cast my eye over the checks, neck scarfs, and long floral dresses. ldquoThe youngsters love trying on their costumes, says Rhona. ldquoItrsquos like playing dressing up.Between scenes I catch up with some of the cast. First up was Curlyhis rival Jud Fryand Andrew Carnes .Itrsquos Finrsquos first show with KIYT and hersquos looking forward to playing the lovelorn cowboy. ldquoI was hoping to play Curly, hersquos a kind guy with a big heart. Rehearsals are fun, I enjoy acting with everyone. They are a great group of people.Oliver is playing Ado Anniersquos protective father Andrew Carnes, who doesnrsquot want cowboy Will Parker to marry his daughter.ldquoHe is a bold character and fatherly figure, said Oliver. ldquoIrsquom working on the accent, itrsquos going pretty well.And the most feared character is Jud Fry, played by Nathan Pirie. I have to say, he didnrsquot strike me as the typical villain. That was until I saw him in action during rehearsal!ldquoIrsquove always wanted to be an actor and be the bad guy, he said. ldquoI have to put on quite a low voice for my character. Hersquos a dark person. Irsquom looking forward to the wedding scene when I have a fight with Curly.This yearrsquos leading lady is Neve Scott, who last year made her debut performance with KIYT as the con-woman Lily St Regis in Annie.Neve played the ditsy, whiney floozy, but this year will grace this stage as the head-strong farm girl Laurey, who secretly loves Curly.She said: ldquoThis role is the complete opposite to the character I played last year which is great. I have some fantastic solos and I have been working on expanding my vocals to hit the powerful notes. I love having to put on an accent and Irsquove been working hard to perfect it. The whole cast are great and I canrsquot wait to perform with them.Angela Grant is new to KIYT and has landed the role of the feisty Aunt Eller. ldquoI watched the film but I really started to like my character when we began rehearsing. Itrsquos my first acting role and Irsquom enjoying being part of a musical theatre group. When all the cast get together for scenes therersquos a great atmosphere.I caught up with George Brydon who is saddling up to play cowboy Will Parker. ldquoI feel very excited to play Will because hersquos a happy-go-lucky sort of guy with some sick moves, and Irsquom looking forward to learning the two-step. Irsquom loving being in Oklahoma. Itrsquos a great show with classic songs.Unfortunately I didnrsquot get the chance to catch all the cast ndash perhaps Ado Annie was too busy to peel herself away from the smooth-talking cowboys!I did, however, sneak a peek at the auction scene being rehearsed. Whilst bids of dollars, saddles and even a horse are being hollered, I make my bid and buy a ticket for this show, because this cast are doing grand in Oklahoma and theyrsquore gonna treat you great!Tickets for the shows on November ,  and  are now available from the Thrt Shop or The Hub in Innerleithen, Graham McGrathrsquos, Peebles, www.idas.org.uk booking@idaos.org.uk, Facebook inneropera, or by phoning  ."},{"url":null,"title":"end-era","story":"FOR one night, and one night only, Billy Connolly is gting us one last laugh in an exclusive screening of his last tour.Filmed during the final leg of his Australia tour in , The Sex Le of Bandagesis a stark reminder of Connollys hilarity and humanity.Viewers arent just shown Billy in his natural habitat of the stand-up stage, we also get an eye opening look into his personal le since his Parkinsons Disease diagnosis in .

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council.

forward include allowing the countyrsquos schools to switch their scheduled May holiday from May  to May  and either ldquolook sympathetically on any requests from non-school staff who want to take the day off to mark the occasion or move the September bank holiday to May  for other workers.The option of changing the school holiday would benefit the council as the Scottish Qualications Authority has scheduled exams for May  next year, which would mean some staff having to work that day.But while those options have been supported by teaching union the EIS, Unison has said it prefers another option which would see the date given as an additional holiday.A report due to be considered by councillors next week warns that adding an extra dayrsquos holiday could cost up to pound, in additional payments.It also warned that an extra holiday for the schools would require permission from the Scottish Government as it would reduce the year for pupils to  days.Councillors will be told that

to mark the day and one had granted an additional holiday.The proposals will be decided at a meeting of East Lothian Council on Tuesday."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource

Later events have undermined the wisdom of these dates even as they have increased the chance of achieving the prize.To win a referendum this time next year the SNP would have to switch from talking about how bad Brexit is and will be and start talking about what would change under independence.Those who would be persuaded by rhetoric, anti-Tory, anti-Boris sentiment have already been persuaded.

The blurring of sexual demarcation lines has long offered young eyes, often visiting a theatre for the first time, the awareness that anybody can play anybody who can fall in love with anyone.Yet,males are removed from the line-up the fear is panto becomes less about the battle between Good versus Evil, about love conquering all, and more about tick-box sexual politics.Panto queen Elaine C. Smith however reckons the removal of the Y chromosome from the line up to be immensely positive ldquoConsidering the only picture for a century or more has been of menin panto then itrsquos a great way to balance things. Edinburgh is all-male as ever, Aberdeen, again men led, and across the UK not much has changed.

Last year, an all-female cast enjoyed a runaway success with the fabulous Pride and Prejudice , featuring five females wearing frocks and Doc Martins and sometimes moustaches. Yet, Austenrsquos story was one of the battle of the sexes, exploring the very dferent sensibilities. And the Tron conceit of a woman, for example, playing a wet-shirted, stuff-shirted Darcy, offered huge comedic value.But panto isnrsquot nearly so complex. What we all want is Aladdin to get the better of Abanazar and get off with the Princess , or for Cinders to show her sisters therersquos no point in cutting off your toes to spite your face.Yet, therersquos another question thrown up by the move to remove men. If male actors donrsquot get the chance to play Uglies, is this a de facto political statement saying itrsquos now wrong to laugh at a butch man in a dress  Is Dick Emery dead to us The Tronrsquos version of the Uglies will see two women play daft men instead. That may be funny, but consider this: panto has long been moving away from the Principal Boy being played by a women, with some feminist groups saying the character objecties women.Butthe new Cinderella sees women send up masculinity, is this not equally wrong And had this all-female casting policy been around in the past fty years we would have been denied the drag talents of the likes of Stanley Baxter, Rikki Fulton and Jack Milroyand Johnny Beattie.

There has been real concern over access to Insch station for a number of years and Nestrans have been working with partners to ensure we can come to a solution.”“This is a crucial piece of work to determine the untapped potential in and around Insch and I would encourage members of the community to come along, see the possibilities and let us know their views.”The consultation event will be held on Monday, October , in the Platform  waiting room from -pm.Residents are welcome to go along to provide feedback on accessibility issues and potential options with members of the project team.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The conference is intended to address all of those requests and includes workshops on funding, disability inclusion, social media and mental health.\"  Calling all local clubs!

We are organising events around the country and I am keen to hear from a wide range of people, especially those with personal experience of the criminal justice system.“In particular, we will now engage in serious discussions on all of these findings including whether we should move to a two verdicts system. “My mind is open and we will not pre-judge the outcome of those conversations.”The research was undertaken on behalf of the Scottish Government by Ipsos MORI Scotland and researchers from the Universities of Glasgow and Warwick.Nearly  people took part in the jury research.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amThis week#s edition of The Orcadian is now available in shops and online, here.

The new agreement has been criticised by commentators for undermining the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking in the house yesterday, Mr Carmichael asked: “The creation of a customs border down the Irish Sea and the necessary declarations as a consequence of that is something about which Ruth Davidson and the former Secretary of State for Scotland warned last year.#They said then, and it’s true now, that it will undermine the Union. Why is the Secretary of State disregarding his Rt Hon Friend’s advice ”Responding in the house, the secretary of state said: “This is a deal that protects the border, this was a key priority for me as Secretary of State. It protects the peace process. The economy of Northern Ireland, I think, will benefit from this deal . . . and I would work over the implementation period to minimise any problems for Northern Ireland businesses in exporting and selling into Great Britain.”Responding after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The Secretary of State’s response was muddled and confused. It shows once again that the Conservative Party is now so fixated with Brexit that it is blind to the damage that they risk doing to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The lack of concern shown by the Government about this issue is deeply concerning.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Customers travelling from Kirkwall will now be able to fly to destinations such as Exeter, Norwich and Southampton with just one ticket.Loganair and Flybe routes to and from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Manchester – the five main airports where the airlines’ networks meet – are included. According to the companies, this means that customers making a single booking for a connecting journey between Flybe and Loganair flights will be  check-in bags right through to their final destination with the assurance that they will be re-booked to their destination free of chargeweather conditions or other delays lead to missed connections.The airlines have said that the new codeshare agreement also offers a signicant saving for customers as they no longer have to pay the multiple Air Passenger Duty charges they faced previously when buying separate tickets from Loganair and Flybe to build their own connecting itinerary.Alan Tune, Flybe’s director of sales, alliances and strategic partnerships, said: “We are pleased to add Loganair to our ever-increasing list of codeshare partners, offering customers even more flight connection opportunities by linking our route networks.#The new codeshare agreement with our Loganair partner offers unrivalled connectivity between most of the main cities, islands and regions of the UK, and onwards to several key European cities, too.”Jonathan Hinkles, Loganair’s Managing Director, added: “I’m incredibly pleased to be launching this new partnership with Flybe, which will bring tremendous benefits for customers through assured connections, reduced travel costs and convenient through check-in.#The new codeshare agreement will link all of the communities that we’re proud to serve as Scotland’s airline with major destinations throughout the UK and Europe, and I’m sure that this will be fantastic news for UK tourism, business and by making it easier to visit friends and family.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This scheme will include looking at prehistoric seafaring and what the Isles were like thousands of years ago, what travel would have been like between the isles with very dferent sea levels. Shipwrecks will also be considered — uncovering more information about wrecks around the isles, looking at any that might still be unrecorded and sharing anecdotes and stories passed down through families and between friends. One aspect of the project will look at maritime cultural landscapes and how sea links and industries have shaped the character of each isle. Maritime art will also be explored in more detail in each island including the possibility of creating an art exhibition or trail that is inspired by the maritime nature of the isles.   Andy Golightly, programme manager for the North Isles Landscape Partnership said: “If people get involved in this project as well as the opportunity to find out more about maritime history and perhaps add to the existing research there will be the chance to learn new and interesting skills including surveying, mapping and even expanding their creative and artistic abilities too”     Natalia Bain from Wessex Archaeology added: “We have arranged a series of information events across isles so people can find out more about the project, the opportunities for involvement and what they would like to research.” Information sessions about the project will be held throughout next week. This includes events at Sanday Community School on Monday, October  Westray Junior High on Tuesday, October  St Ann#s Community Room in Papa Westray on Wednesday, October  Eday Heritage Centre on Thursday, October  North Ronaldsay Community Centre on Friday, November  and at the Boathouse in Shapinsay on Saturday, November .Dates in Stronsay and Rousay, Eglisay and Wyre are to be confirmed.For further information, you can contact the North Isles Landscape Partnership Scheme via its Facebook Page.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This further three month delay is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland needed, given the ongoing uncertainty it creates.“It seems that every time Ministers make an announcement the deadline for the new contract gets pushed back. This latest delay is blamed on concerns raised by the European Commission. Given the regular dialogue between the Scottish Government and the Commission over the past year, it beggars belief that Ministers should have been caught out in this way.“Meanwhile, businesses and communities in Orkney and Shetland are left wondering when they will ever get clarity over the future of these leline ferry services.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney currently outranks every other Scottish partnership in eight out of nine of these indicators.Sally Shaw, chief officer for Orkney Health and Care, said: #In undertaking the activities set out in this plan and the developing Strategic Commissioning Implementation Plan, we are determined to use all available community assets and also to ensure our third sector colleagues become equal partners.  Equal does not just mean sitting at the same table, it means having an equal say in how, what and when we commission, amongst other things.#We also seek to ensure that we break down hierarchy and other barriers that hinder our staff in their day to day work. We want to develop imagination, innovation and a culture where staff feel engaged, enabled and are part of a learning organisation.  We see this as essential for driving forward what will be a ‘health and social care revolution’ here in Orkney.#The plan is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S ohac-strategic-commissioning-plan.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is part of , that will need to be fitted per day across the whole of the UK. The Zero Carbon Communities report, commissioned by ScottishPower, details the changes Scotland and the UK will need to make in order to cancel out greenhouse gas emissions and sets out what this will mean for society. It warns plans and investments must be put in place now for decarbonisation goals to be met and calls for more power to be devolved to local communities so they can make decisions tailored to their specic needs.It also advises that all future regulation should have climate targets at its core.Demand for electricity is forecast to double as the nation switches to greener transport and heating.The total bill for the transformation, including upgrades to the electricity grid costing £. billion, is estimated to reach £. billion by . But the report argues that much of the work and investment will need to be in place by .Frank Mitchell, chief executive of ScottishPower’s transmission and distribution arm SP Energy Networks, insists work towards decarbonisation needs to be stepped up.“To reach net zero every community will need to make changes. And each community will be unique in that journey,” he said.“This is something we’ve really got to get the pace picked up on, given the  timescale. In reality that’s not a long time.“We also need to recognise that what’s needed in Glasgow is very dferent from what’s needed in Edinburgh and what’s needed in Liverpool or London. And we must acknowledge this localisation in the decision-making process and realise a one-size-fits-all approach won’t work.“The changes should be made as efficiently and pro-actively as possible to make sure communities are able to get to the target quicker.“Current regulation means we react to demand rather than get in front of it. That was OK for history, but now we urgently need to help people to embrace a low-carbon future.”Keith Anderson, chief executive of ScottishPower, added: “We know electricity demand will more than double as we move away from the fossil fuels that power our cars and heat our homes today.“We all need to do more to address climate change, and this campaign sets out how we think government and the regulator can help communities drive their own transition to zero carbon. “More power needs to be devolved locally so that communities have a stronger voice in plans to decarbonise their neighbourhoods.” He added: “Zero Carbon targets may seem like a long way off, butwe’re to work with communities properly to ensure people aren’t left behind by the green transition, the reality is there’s no time to lose.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon very happy to have general election before christmas","story":"The First Minister said she would be ldquovery happy for the country to go to the polls in December.window.twttr However, she refused to confirm whether the SNP would work with the Conservatives to bring about an election, by bringing forward a motion of no confidenceLabour does not, or supporting a motion to get around the Fixed Term Parliaments Act.: Poll: Scottish independence voters switching to support the UnionIt came amid growing confusion over the position of both the main parties, with Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn publicly declaring they want a general election while holding private talks on passing Brexit legislation to clear the way for the UK to leave the EU.Downing Street claims Parliament brokenDowning Street sought to ramp up pressure to go to the polls, claiming that parliament was ldquobroken after MPs voted on Tuesday to scrap the governmentrsquos timetable to leave the EU on  October.The Prime Minister spoke with EU Council president Donald Tusk and German Chancellor Angela Merkel by phone yesterday, telling both that Brexit should go ahead on  October.But a Number  source admitted that it ldquolooks like Brussels will offer an extension until  January.ldquoIn that point we know what will always happen: this broken Parliament will always vote for delay rather than a deal, the source said.ldquoThereforethis Parliament is unwilling to vote for a deal then we will have to go for a general election.Corbyn, Johnson meet for talksIt emerged that Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn and their senior aides met for talks on agreeing a new timetable for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which was lsquopausedrsquo on Tuesday following a government defeat on its programme motion.: Edinburgh MP Ian Murray could run as independent candidatedeselected by LabourA Labour spokeswoman said Mr Corbyn had offered to ldquoagree a reasonable timetable to debate, scrutinise and amend the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.But a Conservative Party source claimed Mr Corbyn ldquomade clear he has no policy except more delays and to spend  having referendums ndash a reference to the Labour leader opening the door to allowing a second Scottish independence referendum.A Downing Street source added: ldquoI do not expect any further talks.Divisions within Downing StreetThere are understood to be growing isions within Downing Street over whether to seek an election.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH1110NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 11th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

He said: “With the Hallowe’en break upon us, there still unfortunately remains the threat from large volumes of often illegal fireworks in the countryside.  “These illegal fireworks, and especially the loud banger types, still pose a considerable threat to farm livestock. “In my capacity as Constituency MLA, I have welcomed any past seizures in by the police of any amounts of illegal fireworks which could have caused injury not just to others but also to the users. “I appeal to the community thatthey have any knowledge of these types of attacks to give the information as soon as possible to the police so that these people can be brought before the courts and face the due process of the law. “I also appeal to parents to ensure they know that their children are doing. Attacks on live stock are an open attack on the farmer’s livelihood and assets.  “And it’s not just farm animals which have suffered under the threat of the so-called Banger Menace.  “As a community, we have a moral duty to assist the police and the courts in eradicating the threats to le and physical attacks from these Hallowe’en Hoods.  “These socially sick iniduals often get their kicks by intimidating the more vulnerable in our society. As a community, we cannot afford to wait until a flock or herd is burned alive before taking action to help the forces of law and order stamp out the Banger Menace. “As a community, we must not be flippant about the threat of fire dangers to barns and bales, especially with the high costs of replacement fodder for the upcoming winter,” said Assemblyman Swann.

Many of her previous publications topped the book charts in the UK and Ireland, some even making on to the prestigious Sunday Times Best Seller list.In her latest publication, the experienced cook s to her roots with wholesome recipes for easy and affordable meals to suit all occasions - from quick mid-week suppers to the traditional family Sunday lunch.For Jenny, food has come full circle, and her wisdom and advice over her long career has always reflected the needs and trends of society.Since the start of her illustrious career, which has seen her present pioneering television cooking shows, appear at events, establish her cookery school and publish extensively, her personal style has evolved and changed dramatically. Jenny describes her cooking style now as more relaxed and healthier, offering great results with less fuss. She has reflected this approach in her new recipes.Fundamentally, Jenny’s guiding principals have remained the same throughout her career. She wants to empower people to create tasty, wholesome food that brings everyone to the table with a smile on their face.“I have taken familiar recipes and updated them with a modern twist drawing on influences and tastes from the full spectrum of the global cuisine,” Jenny says.“There are few people who don’t appreciate the merits of a Sunday roast dinner, a slice of cake and warm, home-baked bread served with a bowl of soup.“My roots are in the country and in my new book I want people to connect with our world-class, local produce and enjoy the bounty of nature all around us while supporting and strengthening our food infrastructure.“I understand everyone is struggling in these uncertain times. We are all juggling busy schedules, domestic budgeting and a healthy diet, so I have created a collection of streamlined recipes for lighter, fresher dishes that are easy to prepare and heartwarmingly delicious and nutritious.”At Home With Jenny features food for all seasons from Valentine’s Day to Christmas and everything in between. It’s perfect for both novice and seasoned cooks with sections covering starters, mains, outdoor cooking and wonderfully tempting sweet treats.Jenny’s experience has taught her the strong connection between a positive, balanced diet and good physical and mental health. In this new book, she is keen to promote the whole experience of a healthy food lestyle.“Food is a great way to bring people together both formally and informally. I am encouraging people to make these dishes and sit down at the table with family and friends converse and enjoy the food. “Every meal is an occasion to connect and what better to do it than over food made with love,” Jenny says.At Home With Jenny features recipes for pizza, fish dishes, steak, casseroles, cakes, salads, and lots more. Seasonal dishes include sumptuous autumnal Roasted Bramley Apple and Pumpkin Soup, as well as warming Crusted Tart with Pulled Brisketand Filo topping - just perfect for winter days.Each dish in this collection has a strong connection to nature and landscape reflecting Jenny’s love of the outdoors which she pursues by surfing on the North Coast and sparking up outdoor cooking at every opportunity – even to make Christmas dinner!It has been four years since Jenny last published a book. In that time, she has been kept incredibly busy with her cookery school in Cullybackey, and appearing at events right across Northern Ireland.Jenny says: “Over the last few years, I have been out of the home kitchen and connecting with people from all walks of le. “This has afforded me a fantastic experience to discuss and find out directly what people actually want when it comes to cooking at home.“Recently, there has been a push-back against the relentless demands of digital technology. Many people find cooking a mindful way of relaxing while nourishing their minds, bodies and souls. People want simplicity and to be connected to how their food is sourced and prepared.“In my new book, I have carefully considered all the important contemporary food issues such as dietary requirements, time and finances and I have put together a simple guide to help everyone make healthy choices that satisfy your appetite for le!”Home With Jenny is available now from jenny@jennybristow and at book signing events throughout Ireland.It is priced at pound.

But for every bad news story about young people, there are so many more good news stories with many youngsters going above and beyond for the great of their own community.One such example is a group of girls from New Lodge Youth Centre who have recently embarked on an intergenerational project with elderly people in local nursing homes and accommodated living.An intergenerational project is one designed to help build better relationships between young and old people as well as tackle issues such as bullying and bereavement.The project also creates learning opportunities for the pupils and the elderly, with young people working one-on-one with seniors and asking questions about their childhood, work, hobbies and le in general.Paul Dynes from New Lodge Youth Centre said the intergenerational project came about thanks to their great relationship with Newington Housing Association.“Basically, the project came about after work between the youth centre and Martin Hamilton from Newington Housing Association, who use our building for ious events,” he said. “They have also provided us with support for ious programmes over the last couple of years. From our work together, it sparked an idea of doing some more things together. It was actually a group of young girls that came to one of our youth workers to express a real interest and want to engage with an elderly home or accommodated living or. as it is better known, some sort of intergenerational project.”The project is now in full swing with the girls spending a couple of hours each week engaging with the elderly.“The first session was all about storytelling, sharing experiences and memories before it progressed to taking part in games and activities to spark such conversations between them,” added Paul.“They were able to build up relationships with each other and started to understand more about each other which was key to the rest of the project. Since then, they have done all sorts of things together such as baking and other fun-based activities.“They have recently decided to go on to do a shared-art piece where they will create fashionable dresses to show the evolution of fashion over the years to the modern day.”Paul is now hopeful the project will be something other communities can take note of in order to break the stigma of some young people and elderly folk’s opinions of each other.“I think the bigger issue is that some young people may have views on elderly people and vice-versa.“Some young people get a bad name by causing trouble or engaging in anti-social behaviour and this type of project helps create an understanding of one another.“There is definitely a need for it within our community and indeed, in the wider society.“If there are people and groups who want to make it happen, it certainly can.“I would like to thank Martin Hamilton , James Begleyand everyone at New Lodge Arts and the Ashton Centre for their work and help in making the project happen.”To get involved with New Lodge Youth Centre, contact   "},{"url":null,"title":"farmers kept in dark about trade after brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Chesnutt, from the Ulster Farmers Union, speaking to a Republic of Ireland parliament committee on Britain’s exit from the EU, said it was essential that free-flowing cross-border trade is protected.“The industry is completely integrated, so it goes without saying to rip this apart makes no sense at all,” he told the committee.“We have a deal on the table but we need clarity, for instance Northern Ireland produce processed in the south, can it go out in EU trade deals to the rest of the world “Becauseit can’t, companies in the south might not want it, they need to be able to access those trade deals.“We’re getting conflicting clarication from producers and the government, we’re waiting for clarication on that and the same the other way.“On qualying goods, pigs going to Cookstownto be slaughtered from Republic of Ireland, and processed into UK market, is that a qualying good Brexit presents the most serious threat to Irish farming and our agri-food sector in the history of the State.Joe Healey“These are the things we need the answers to.”Mr Chesnutt added that the dangers to agriculture are not limited to the border counties.“This is not just a border community issue, this is the whole island of Ireland, we are completely integrated, as far as the north is concerned, for the prosperity of agriculture, we need to do something sensible to get this worked out.”Mr Chesnutt added that his group, which represents farmers in Northern Ireland, and had backed Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, said the situation had “gotten very political from the start”.“We did get some quite nasty criticism but we stand by the decision,” he said.“We moved on from there, now we have a new deal on the table, some say we’ve the best of both worlds in this deal, but we’re not so sure of that, that’s something we need clarication on.”All representatives speaking to the committee were clear that the sector has already begun to see the effects of Brexit.“Brexit presents the most serious threat to Irish farming and our agri-food sector in the history of the State,” Joe Healy, the president of the Irish Farmers Union, said on Wednesday.“With .bn euro of our food and drinks exports going to the UK, no other member state and no other sector is as exposed in these negotiations.“The UK is the market for % or , tonnes of Irish beef exports.“For the beef sector, the threat from Brexit is frightening.“The reality is, even before Brexit, massive damage is already being done to Irish agriculture.“In the past year alone, Brexit uncertainty and the devaluation of sterling have had a very negative impact on Irish agriculture, with losses in the beef sector alone at m euro up to the end of September .”The committee also heard that farmers had lost confidence in the industry, and that a major concern is a fall in funding for CAP payments after Britain leaves the

A last-ditch attempt to block abortion law changes in Northern Ireland led by the DUP failed, with the law changing at midnight on Monday. Unionist parties, who oppose the upcoming liberalisation, triggered the assemblys recall with a signed petition. Members of the SDLP were also in attendance. But Speaker, Robin Newton, informed MLAs that the Assembly had to elect a speaker and deputies with cross community support before any other business could take place. That became impossible when SDLP leader Colum Eastwood declared he wasn’t willing to facilitate a “unionist talking shop” and led his party out of the chamber. As they made their way out cries of “shame” were shouted by DUP MLAs. googletag.cmd.push As a result of their leaving no nationalist representatives remained, meaning no new speaker could be elected and the sitting was suspended after less than an hour. Jim Allister accused the SDLP of thwarting the formation of an Assembly and said they were therefore thwarting legislation to protect the lives of unborn children. The DUP later walked out, vowing that this was not the end of the matter and they would seek to challenge the law. Mrs Foster said it was a shameful day which would leave Northern Ireland with Europes most liberal abortion laws. They were swtly followed by the UUP after Robin Swann labelled the day’s events a “pantomime” and called on the Secretary of State to consider whether there is any future for the NI Assembly. ‘Pantomime’ Some unionist assembly members had been attempting to introduce the Defence of the Unborn Child Bill , which they hoped to pass by midnight. Two members tabled a Private Members’ Bill in an attempt to halt the Westminster legislation decriminalising abortion. DUP MLA Paul Givan argued the point as to why it should happen having sought legal advice from the Attorney General. The DUP leader Arlene Foster implored the Speaker to share his legal advice with MLAs. However, Mr Newton - who was elected as a DUP MLA - resisted attempts to persuade him to suspend assembly rules to allow the bill to be introduced. Legal advice was sought, he said, and he was content with the guidance provided which is “confidential and privileged”. In July, MPs at Westminster passed legislation which requires the government to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Irelanddevolution is not restored by  October. Mondays sitting was the first time the assembly had sat for nearly three years.

A meeting of the NI Affairs Committee heard evidence from Secretary of State for NI Julian Smith and other government officials. During the evidence session Mr Smith acknowledged that poundm spent on MLA salaries since  is “unacceptable” when challenged by North Down MP Lady Hermon. It was also stated that relative trade flows set out in the impact assessment accompanying the Withdrawal Agreement Bill show that NI has a total trading bill of poundbn with GB, pound.bn with Ireland and pound.bn with the rest of the EU. googletag.cmd.push DUP MP Gregory Campbell therefore said trade on an East-West basis is “signicantly greater” than any other trade. He referred to a Treasury Select Committee meeting where it was mentioned that the current Brexit deal will result in administrative costs for businesses. “Can you understand that businesses will want more than a reassurance  On the other side of the equation people ask for and demand that it be written in stone, in a legislative process, because guarantees come and go and governments come and go, but the legislation is more dficult to change. “Do you understand why people would want to see that reassurance that you’ve given in the Bill ” The SoS said he does understand andthe Withdrawal Deal Bill was brought forward he would look to insert clauses to make “crystal clear” that the unfettered access commitment in relation to the flow of goods from GB to NI are laid down in law. He also said that he wants to work with every sector to minimise any challenges, adding that he sees it as a “huge opportunity” for businesses here. Labour MP Conor McGinn said unionists and nationalists have inevitably become ided on the constitutional issue of whether to have a land border on the island of Ireland or one down the Irish Sea. The St Helens North MP askedthe best way would be for the whole of the UK to be in a Customs Union with the EU. The SoS disagreed believing it would prevent the UK from striking trade deals with other countries and he feels the current deal offers the “best of both worlds” for NI. Mr McGinn put it to him that it is bad for NI to have either border. Julian Smith referred to his previous response to Gregory Campbell and sought to give assurances that there will be very little bureaucracy involved. Who made the “seismic” decision to switch policy from a border on the island to one down the Irish Sea , Mr McGinn asked. The complaint about the previous Bill was that NI would be trapped in a backstop, Mr Smith responded, and that has been done away with. He was then askedhe wished to apologise to unionists for making a promise that couldn’t be kept, but said he believes it has no impact on the constitutional position of NI or workings of the Assembly. Irish Language Act Speaking later at the meeting, East Derry MP Mr Campbell said that apart from Sinn Feacutein no other has put down an “absolute fundamental precondition” before they will go back into Stormont. In Mr Smith’s view there are a “number of issues” and he urged all parties to be “flexible”. “I understand the need for diplomacy but there is only one party saying we will not move until a pre-condition we have set arbitrarily is met and that’s Sinn Feacutein,” Mr Campbell remarked. He added that through amendments at Westminster one of their preconditions has been met and there was a “ludicrous and absurd” suggestion that the other one should be met, “the Irish Language Act”. The DUP MP said the British government has accepted this “blackmail” without asking for cross-community consent. He said either devolution is over or the rules have to be rewritten. Mr Smith responded: “There are absolutely no plans for the Irish Language Act coming from Westminster. Absolutely none. “On the issues of abortion and same sex marriage, these are devolved matters, they should be resolved in NI, the challenge I think there is, is that as the Assembly continues to be absent, no Executive, colleagues here at Westminster got frustrated and it was a free vote issue that went through.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He was killed aged just  whilst taking part in the dam busters raid in May, .Reporter: Eamon Sweeney::  Oct   addthis, Richard Bolitho was born in Derry on January ,  but was killed at the age of just  having taken part in one of the most pivotal events of World War II.Richard Bolitho was born in Derry on January ,  but was killed at the age of just  having taken part in one of the most pivotal events of World War II. William Bolitho, Richards father, was a Cornish commercial traveller in the seed business who stayed on in Ireland after marrying Jane Cuthbertson, the daughter of a local land steward, from Braehead just outside the city. In  the Bolithos moved from Derry to the town of Kimberley in Nottinghamshire where they bought a hotel. Presumably, while his mother and father got the new business up and running, Richard moved in with his aunt Emily who owned a local fruit and vegetable store. But, after her death, William Bolitho sold the hotel and took over the shop. googletag.cmd.push The young Richard Bolitho, an only child, was educated at the nearby Church Hill School and from there won a scholarship to Heanor Grammar School in . He joined the RAF in  but it wasnt until  that he was selected for aircrew training. After qualying as an air gunner Bolitho was posted to an operational training unit where he teamed with five others and they all flew together for the first time on February , . Six weeks later they were all posted to the newly formed  Squadron. Before WWII the British Air Ministry had identied the industrialised Ruhr valley as an important strategic target. The dams along the valley were the valuable source of providing hydroelectric power and pure water for steel-making as well as drinking water and water for the canal transport system in Germany. The belief was that attacks on the dams with large bombs could effectively cripple the manufacturing base heavily prized by the Nazis but at this stage the RAF had been unable to accurately hit hard enough to achieve that aim. It was calculated that a surprise nocturnal attack could work but there was no explosive device capable of achieving it. This is where Barnes Wallis came in. A scientist, engineer and inventor in early  he had begun experimenting with skipping marbles over water tanks in his garden. From this he developed a paper called Spherical Bomb-Surface Torpedo, the idea being that a bomb could skip over the surface of water, avoid torpedo nets and sink directly beside a battleship or a dam and act as a depth charge with the surrounding water concentrating the force of the explosion on the target. Wallis also developed backspin on these devices that would cause the bombs to trail behind the aircraft that dropped it and decreased the chance that the plane would be damaged by the explosion. It also increased the range of the bombs and prevented them from moving away from the target wall as it sank. After initial doubts, the RAF accepted Wallis bouncing bomb for attacks on the Mohne, Edersee and Sorpe dams in the Ruhr valley. Operation Chastise was carried out on - May,  by Squadron  which included Richard Bolitho. Using two spotlights to gauge the correct height, a modied Lancaster Bomber dropped a backspin drum shaped bomb which bounced over the dams torpedo nets hit the wall and spun down to the base before exploding. The Mohne and Edersee Dams were hit and caused catastrophic flooding of the Ruhr valley and the villages in the Eder area. The Sorpe dam sustained minor damage. Two hydroelectric power stations were destroyed and and several more damaged. Factories and coal mines were also destroyed. The human cost was also catastrophic. Overall, an estimated , civilians- Germans and , mainly forced labourers from the Soviet Union died. By necessity of achieving their aim, one plane flew so low that it hit the sea with the result that its bomb was torn off and scooped up seawater into the fuselage. Another plane was consumed by flames when it ploughed straight into high voltage electricity cables. However, some historians have argued about the levels of success that the raids achieved stating that the dams were repaired in a matter of five months. The head of the RAF, Sir Arthur Bomber Harris thought that the entire episode had been harebrained all along later wrote: I have seen nothing to show that the effort was worthwhile except as a spectacular operation. The inventor of the bouncing bomb Barnes Wallis was awarded the sum of pound, for his war work from the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors. But, because of the loss of so many peoples lives during the raids he donated the entire amount to Christs Hospital School in  which allowed the children of the RAF personnel killed or injured to attend the school. Richard Bolithos last leave from the RAF before what became known as the Dam Busters raid was spent at home in Kimberley, Nottinghamshire where he was joined by his colleagues Flyod Wile, John Kinnear and Albert Garshowitz. Days later, in the early hours of Monday, May   all of them were killed during the raid. Sergeant Richard Bolitho was rear gunner on the mission his Lancaster Bomber was sent out on the first wave of aircraft taking part in the attacks. Their plane went down near Marbeck in Germany after being hit by anti-aircraft fire and were buried at Borken. They were later reinterred at Reichwald Forest War Cemetery. In all,  men in  planes took part in the attacks on the dams- of them died and three were captured. The Derry born Dam Buster is remembered on a war memorial which was first placed at his former school, Heanor Grammar School and later moved to Marpool All Saints Church in Nottinghamshire when the school closed in . Richard Blothios name is also on the war memorial at Kimberley, the village where he grew up. In May, ,  years after the Dam Busters raids on Germany portraits of all  men painted by artist Dan Llywelyn were unveiled at the Bomber Command Centre in Lincoln and the Dambusters Inn at Scampton in Lincolnshire from where the Lancaster bombers departed. In , three years after Richard Bolithos death, his parents ed to live in Northern Ireland and saw out their days in Portrush. Thirty-one years earlier on November ,  Richard Bolithos grandmother, Jane Cuthbertson from Braehead was buried at Derry City Cemetery having passed away at the age of . Her husband, Robert Cuthbertson was buried with his we having passed away on February ,  aged . Their daughter Jane Bolitho, Richards mother, died aged  on November ,  and is buried with her parents.

The brown bear can call Ireland home again after a , year wait thanks to an Inishowen man with a big dream. This Friday, passionate wildle lover Killian McLaughlin will see his lelong dream of reintroducing some of Irelands extinct animals to their former natural habitat become a reality when the gates to his new sanctuary opens to the public. Built on a -acre site at Dundrain, Burnfoot, Wild Ireland has become home to three brown bears, three wolves, a lynx and other species of animals previously native to Ireland but now extinct here. googletag.cmd.push Among the  species of animals at the sanctuary includes a troop of Barbary Macaque monkeys.  Killian McLaughlin pictured with his wolves at the soon to be opened Wild Ireland animal sanctuary this weekend.  Speaking to the Derry Now, Killian said the purpose of Wild Ireland was to educate people on Irelands lost natural history, whilst giving a home to badly neglected animals. “If you go back thousands of years to when Ireland was covered in forest you would have found these animals roaming about,” Killian explained. “Due to humans, these creatures have been lost forever through hunting and deforestation. “What were trying to do here is to educate people that these animals belong here. We are quick to condemn other countries in Africa or Asia about the cruelty of hunting but we have already lost or native animals through hunting. “There are fossils of brown bears found in caves that show how many bears we had in Ireland thousands of years ago, the same goes for the lynx. “We have three wolves here and they only went extinct from Ireland in .” Working with several charities, Killian and his team rescued the animals from terrible conditions. “Working with Bears in Mind, we managed to persuade the Lithuanian government to give us the bears for rehoming. “They were kept in terrible conditions, they never even felt soil before, they were so used to concerte they were unsure of the ground but now they are beginning to be bears again. “We built them a three-metre deep pool so they can submerge themselves, before that the deepest water they had known was in their water dish,” Killian said. Despite being a full time job in itself, Killian has to juggle his work at the sanctuary with his day-job of being a solicitor. “Its been full on,” Killian laughed. “But I love what were doing here. Its so rewarding to see these animals have a chance of a new le.” Wild Ireland opens this weekend, on Friday, October , and will be open daily from am to pm, with last admission every day at pm, costing only € per adult and € per child. Wild Ireland is located close to White Oaks Retreat Centre, between Muff and Burnfoot. You can follow Wild Ireland on Facebook @wildirelandorg and visit the website at www.wildireland .org.

Danielle Doherty and Emma Bradley received hearftelt congratulations from across the city when photos of them at ious city centre landmarks appeared on social media on the day of their wedding. The couple also revealed that a photo of them taken at Free Derry Corner was their way of acknowledging the battle for civil rights for all at the iconic monument. googletag.cmd.push At midnight on Monday, same-sex marriage legislation in Northern Ireland fell into line with England, Scotland and Wales after Westminster enacted the laws in the continuing absence of Stormont. Same-sex marriage was recognised in the Republic of Ireland in May  after a referendum decreed a change in the constitution that marriage was legal irrespective of the gender of the partners. Danielle told the Derry News: “Having a wedding in the North wasnt an option. It wasnt anything I wanted to do, because I didnt want a civil partnership, I wanted a marriage. Im Irish, I live in Ireland and so I wanted to get married here, and it was legal here, so we went to Donegal. “I think a civil partnership made it seem that what we had was less important – it undermined the whole relationship. And, Emma said: “We didnt even consider looking at venues in the North, we werent interestedit wasnt a marriage. I thought why should other people be allowed to marrythey are in love  Why are we any dferent  We had to border hop to be treated the same. “When Danielle proposed she didnt ask will you be my civil partner, she asked will you marry me  Asked what the couple thought of the situation where it took the intervention of Westminster legislation to equalise laws on same sex marriage with England. Scotland and Wales, Danielle told the Derry News: “It just seemed asa small minority of people, the DUP, used this to keep themselves in power somehow. Its just baffling that such people exist who have such backward views about the whole thing. But, we would have never waited until it was implemented here before we got married. It was never going to stop us. Emma added: “The rest of the world is moving forward, but it seemed that Northern Ireland was just stuck in the s or s and wasnt moving forward with the rest of the UK or Ireland. I dont care whether it was Westminster or Stormont who brought the changes in the law about. It doesnt bother me how it got in. I think it needed to be taken outside of here because it needed that extra push. Up until a few days ago we were married in the south of Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales but not in our own country. We were only civil partners here.” Danielle said: “For the wedding we decided to do things unconventionally. For a start, we chose to get married on Friday th, because we both consider ourselves to be pretty unlucky,” she laughed. “We got ready together in the morning and had our hair and make-up done together. We went for photos around Derry before the ceremony. “We went to Free Derry Corner and the Museum of Free Derry, the Craft Village and into Peadar ODonnells and poured pints. We love Derry, and ideally yes, it would have been lovely to have got married in Derry but because of the laws it wasnt an option. So we got photos at landmarks that people would know and after that went done to Rockhill House in Letterkenny and got married there. “We had a spiritualist of Ireland ceremony so it was all legal because we couldnt get a registrar in time. And the reception was at Rockhill House that evening. I think we enjoyed it more because we got to spend the whole day together,” Danielle continued. Emma added: “If we had done things traditionally, we wouldnt have seen each other until .pm that day.” The couple admit that getting a wedding picture taken at Free Derry Corner was a purposeful move given the monuments iconic association with the civil rights movement over the last  years. “For me it was. Whenever we met with our photographer she wanted to know where we wanted pictures taken. The first thing we said was Free Derry Corner,” said Danielle. Emma said: “Free Derry Corner, to me is about it being called Free Derry – its about being who you want and doing what you want. People lost their lives for civil rights and we were making a stand that we deserve civil rights as well.” Both women said they had anticipated receiving a few derogatory comments and stares whilst making their way around the Bogside but in fact were overwhelmed by the kind responses of all they encountered, especially after some of the images were posted on social media. “I wasnt really expecting the feedback that it got. We were doing it for us, for our personal reasons.Then seeing the comments on Facebook of people appreciating us taking a stand for our civil rights was great. “When we got off the ten hour flight going on honeymoon and checked our phones, there were hundreds of shares and likes on the phptos that the photographer Lisa Byrne had put up. It was unexpected. Were just two wee girls from Derry that wanted to get married,” said Danielle. The Derry News also askedthe couple have ever felt let down by the political system despite regularly exercising their votes. Emma said: “Personally, sometimes Ive wondered what I am voting for. I have the right to vote and I will use it, but at the end of the day,theres nobody that speaks to me then Im really going to have to consider who I vote for. Danielle added: “There is no Stormont obviously, but thats got to with larger factors. The DUP said no to same-sex marriage and werent willing to compromise. They are obsessed with being part of the UK, but they dont want all of the UKs laws.” So, what were the thoughts when same-sex marriage passed into law in Northern Ireland earlier this week  “My thoughts were, thanks, but weve done it already. You are too late. It doesnt change that me and Danielle are married, but I am happy for the people that spent years fighting for this. We could have been people who said we are not going to get married until it was legal here. But it was legal in this country, you just had to go over the border to get it. But, its a positive thing thats happened. “Anybody in our situation who have struggled with their sexuality have felt dferent and felt that they didnt belong. The solution comes with years of trying to love yourself and trying to accept yourself and realise that you are a person and youre ok to be who you want to be. “I think for teenagers now and people who are coming out younger and younger, it is still dficult to deal with in top of all the other adolescent problems they have to go through. Danielle added: “It was going to happen eventually. It had to go down that road, it was just a matter of when. It couldnt be put off forever. Its great for future generations in that they can be themselves now. Its more acceptable now, its not that big social taboo anymore. Things have progressed a lot. “Were really fortunate with our families, our parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles who have all be really supportive.” Emma concluded: “I would never deny Danielle, or who you are to me, or my sexuality to anyone. If people dont like it, thats tough.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Danielle Doherty and Emma Bradley received hearftelt congratulations from across the city when photos of them at ious city centre landmarks appeared on social media on the day of their wedding. The couple also revealed that a photo of them taken at Free Derry Corner was their way of acknowledging the battle for civil rights for all at the iconic monument. googletag.cmd.push At midnight on Monday, same-sex marriage legislation in Northern Ireland fell into line with England, Scotland and Wales after Westminster enacted the laws in the continuing absence of Stormont. Same-sex marriage was recognised in the Republic of Ireland in May  after a referendum decreed a change in the constitution that marriage was legal irrespective of the gender of the partners. Danielle told the Derry News: “Having a wedding in the North wasnt an option. It wasnt anything I wanted to do, because I didnt want a civil partnership, I wanted a marriage. Im Irish, I live in Ireland and so I wanted to get married here, and it was legal here, so we went to Donegal. “I think a civil partnership made it seem that what we had was less important – it undermined the whole relationship. And, Emma said: “We didnt even consider looking at venues in the North, we werent interestedit wasnt a marriage. I thought why should other people be allowed to marrythey are in love  Why are we any dferent  We had to border hop to be treated the same. “When Danielle proposed she didnt ask will you be my civil partner, she asked will you marry me  Asked what the couple thought of the situation where it took the intervention of Westminster legislation to equalise laws on same sex marriage with England. Scotland and Wales, Danielle told the Derry News: “It just seemed asa small minority of people, the DUP, used this to keep themselves in power somehow. Its just baffling that such people exist who have such backward views about the whole thing. But, we would have never waited until it was implemented here before we got married. It was never going to stop us. Emma added: “The rest of the world is moving forward, but it seemed that Northern Ireland was just stuck in the s or s and wasnt moving forward with the rest of the UK or Ireland. I dont care whether it was Westminster or Stormont who brought the changes in the law about. It doesnt bother me how it got in. I think it needed to be taken outside of here because it needed that extra push. Up until a few days ago we were married in the south of Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales but not in our own country. We were only civil partners here.” Danielle said: “For the wedding we decided to do things unconventionally. For a start, we chose to get married on Friday th, because we both consider ourselves to be pretty unlucky,” she laughed. “We got ready together in the morning and had our hair and make-up done together. We went for photos around Derry before the ceremony. “We went to Free Derry Corner and the Museum of Free Derry, the Craft Village and into Peadar ODonnells and poured pints. We love Derry, and ideally yes, it would have been lovely to have got married in Derry but because of the laws it wasnt an option. So we got photos at landmarks that people would know and after that went done to Rockhill House in Letterkenny and got married there. “We had a spiritualist of Ireland ceremony so it was all legal because we couldnt get a registrar in time. And the reception was at Rockhill House that evening. I think we enjoyed it more because we got to spend the whole day together,” Danielle continued. Emma added: “If we had done things traditionally, we wouldnt have seen each other until .pm that day.” The couple admit that getting a wedding picture taken at Free Derry Corner was a purposeful move given the monuments iconic association with the civil rights movement over the last  years. “For me it was. Whenever we met with our photographer she wanted to know where we wanted pictures taken. The first thing we said was Free Derry Corner,” said Danielle. Emma said: “Free Derry Corner, to me is about it being called Free Derry – its about being who you want and doing what you want. People lost their lives for civil rights and we were making a stand that we deserve civil rights as well.” Both women said they had anticipated receiving a few derogatory comments and stares whilst making their way around the Bogside but in fact were overwhelmed by the kind responses of all they encountered, especially after some of the images were posted on social media. “I wasnt really expecting the feedback that it got. We were doing it for us, for our personal reasons.Then seeing the comments on Facebook of people appreciating us taking a stand for our civil rights was great. “When we got off the ten hour flight going on honeymoon and checked our phones, there were hundreds of shares and likes on the phptos that the photographer Lisa Byrne had put up. It was unexpected. Were just two wee girls from Derry that wanted to get married,” said Danielle. The Derry News also askedthe couple have ever felt let down by the political system despite regularly exercising their votes. Emma said: “Personally, sometimes Ive wondered what I am voting for. I have the right to vote and I will use it, but at the end of the day,theres nobody that speaks to me then Im really going to have to consider who I vote for. Danielle added: “There is no Stormont obviously, but thats got to with larger factors. The DUP said no to same-sex marriage and werent willing to compromise. They are obsessed with being part of the UK, but they dont want all of the UKs laws.” So, what were the thoughts when same-sex marriage passed into law in Northern Ireland earlier this week  “My thoughts were, thanks, but weve done it already. You are too late. It doesnt change that me and Danielle are married, but I am happy for the people that spent years fighting for this. We could have been people who said we are not going to get married until it was legal here. But it was legal in this country, you just had to go over the border to get it. But, its a positive thing thats happened. “Anybody in our situation who have struggled with their sexuality have felt dferent and felt that they didnt belong. The solution comes with years of trying to love yourself and trying to accept yourself and realise that you are a person and youre ok to be who you want to be. “I think for teenagers now and people who are coming out younger and younger, it is still dficult to deal with in top of all the other adolescent problems they have to go through. Danielle added: “It was going to happen eventually. It had to go down that road, it was just a matter of when. It couldnt be put off forever. Its great for future generations in that they can be themselves now. Its more acceptable now, its not that big social taboo anymore. Things have progressed a lot. “Were really fortunate with our families, our parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles who have all be really supportive.” Emma concluded: “I would never deny Danielle, or who you are to me, or my sexuality to anyone. If people dont like it, thats tough.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Dungiven-born GAA was the latest interviewee of Dion Fanning, who runs the Ireland Unfiltered Podcast for Joe.ie.The episode, released on Tuesday, was recorded in Derry. Speaking about the city, Brolly said that he had “always had great affection for” the late Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness. He told a story about McGuinness arriving at the Brolly home when Joe was around six or seven to be “driven across the border.” “I knew Martin for a long time. Martin used to be a visitor at our house when he was a young man,” Brolly said. googletag.cmd.push “I remember my mother putting a  beard on him and, as I recall, the story was that he was going to university and he was my older brother.” He went on to say that McGuinness appeared to have a profound effect on former DUP leader Peter Robinson but that Robinson was “destroyed by the loonies” within his party.  The late Martin McGuinness  He said that he believedSinn Feacutein and the DUP had worked together they could have “attracted money from all over the world” to the north, but this could not happen as “in the end, the DUP is about narrow self-interest.” “I dont think the DUP care about other people. I dont think that people like Sammy Wilson or Gregory Campbell have any concern for their fellow man,” he said. Brolly also spoke about encountering DUP leader Arlene Foster as a young man in Belfast. “She was in the same class as I was and I always found it extraordinary that she was perpetually enraged. I mean, I never saw her when she wasnt enraged,” Brolly said. During the interview he also spoke about his childhood in Dungiven, attending boarding school in Armagh and his work with organ donation charities. He also praised the sense of community he experienced across Ireland with members of the GAA, which he contrasted with England, “a nation of strangers.” “The starting point for any civilised society is community, a sense of community for its own sake and for the sake of prosperity and a sense of empathy with your fellow man,” Brolly said. “What we still have here and why I evangelise so strongly about the GAA, is that the starting point of community is I know you. I dont know you, but I know you. So I gave a kidney to a guy – I didnt know who he was – but he was a GAA man and he had kids that played GAA, that was good enough for me.” Brolly donated his kidney to Shane Finnegan in , after the pair had worked together as coaches for St Brigids GAA club in Belfast. He said during his recovery his mother came in with “thousands and thousands and thousands of letters and messages and cards” from supporters and well-wishers. However due to his reputation as a GAA pundit meant that the messages were not all entirely complimentary, particularly one letter from Ballintubber, Co Mayo. “It started off like all the others. Congratulations on your magnicent gesture in donating a kidney to a fellow Gael. Any chance you could donate the other one ”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Dungiven-born GAA was the latest interviewee of Dion Fanning, who runs the Ireland Unfiltered Podcast for Joe.ie.The episode, released on Tuesday, was recorded in Derry. Speaking about the city, Brolly said that he had “always had great affection for” the late Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness. He told a story about McGuinness arriving at the Brolly home when Joe was around six or seven to be “driven across the border.” “I knew Martin for a long time. Martin used to be a visitor at our house when he was a young man,” Brolly said. googletag.cmd.push “I remember my mother putting a  beard on him and, as I recall, the story was that he was going to university and he was my older brother.” He went on to say that McGuinness appeared to have a profound effect on former DUP leader Peter Robinson but that Robinson was “destroyed by the loonies” within his party.  The late Martin McGuinness  He said that he believedSinn Feacutein and the DUP had worked together they could have “attracted money from all over the world” to the north, but this could not happen as “in the end, the DUP is about narrow self-interest.” “I dont think the DUP care about other people. I dont think that people like Sammy Wilson or Gregory Campbell have any concern for their fellow man,” he said. Brolly also spoke about encountering DUP leader Arlene Foster as a young man in Belfast. “She was in the same class as I was and I always found it extraordinary that she was perpetually enraged. I mean, I never saw her when she wasnt enraged,” Brolly said. During the interview he also spoke about his childhood in Dungiven, attending boarding school in Armagh and his work with organ donation charities. He also praised the sense of community he experienced across Ireland with members of the GAA, which he contrasted with England, “a nation of strangers.” “The starting point for any civilised society is community, a sense of community for its own sake and for the sake of prosperity and a sense of empathy with your fellow man,” Brolly said. “What we still have here and why I evangelise so strongly about the GAA, is that the starting point of community is I know you. I dont know you, but I know you. So I gave a kidney to a guy – I didnt know who he was – but he was a GAA man and he had kids that played GAA, that was good enough for me.” Brolly donated his kidney to Shane Finnegan in , after the pair had worked together as coaches for St Brigids GAA club in Belfast. He said during his recovery his mother came in with “thousands and thousands and thousands of letters and messages and cards” from supporters and well-wishers. However due to his reputation as a GAA pundit meant that the messages were not all entirely complimentary, particularly one letter from Ballintubber, Co Mayo. “It started off like all the others. Congratulations on your magnicent gesture in donating a kidney to a fellow Gael. Any chance you could donate the other one ”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We have been on the receiving end of some bad luck so we’ll take a win by any means tonight. It’s the first time as manager that I’ve won in Sligo so it’s a big win for me.”Devine and his players celebrated enthusiastically in front of the City fans at the final whistle and the manager admitted that the bond between both parties has been a key element of success this year.“It’s all about the fans,” he said. “You see the players’ response to the players and the players’ response to the fans. There’s a real feel about the club at the minute. People are spending money on a Saturday to come down here and we’re very grateful for that. “We’re very grateful of the crowds we’ve had in the Brandywell this year, we’re very grateful that when we’re - down after  minutes the fans aren’t turning on us and they keep encouraging us and keep singing. “It’s all about the fans, it’s all about getting this club back to where I believe it can go. “There will be nobody happier to see us land in Europe this year but there’s still a lot of work to be done.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry City captain scored the winning goal against Sligo Rovers on Saturday night to pout his team on the verge of a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for a team which finished in eighth place in the Premier Division last year.A solitary point against St. Patrick’s Athletic at the Brandywell tomorrow night would seal the deal for Derry City and McNamee admitted that all focus is now on getting the job done. “We were watching the results on Friday night and saw that Pat’s slipped up a wee bit so and we spoke about that before the game because it was a good chance to put a gap between us,” he stated. “We need just one point now from the last two games so we’ll just focus on ourselves because we have a big game on Tuesday night again so it’s about getting ourselves right in the next two days. It’s a quick turnaround but we’ll be ready for it.”McNamee scored only his second goal of the season at Sligo to win Saturday night’s game after goalkeeper Ed McGinty hit it straight at the City captain as he attempted to clear it. For McNamee, it was just about being in the right place at the right time. “The ball was played back to the keeper and I went to put a wee bit of pressure on him but you don’t really expect anything to happen but he more or less kicked it straight at me and I just put the foot out and guided it in,” he explained.“People think I didn’t mean it but I don’t care. The team is going to come before how many goals I get. “This was a big goal which puts us a wee bit closer but whether it’s me or not it doesn’t really “We had a very sloppy start and again another slack goal was given away but credit to the boys again, all season there have been obstacles thrown at us and we’ve always answered. It was a big win and as Decky says, you don’t win too many games down here.”The Candy Stripes can still secure third place with home victories over St. Pat’s and Finn Harps this week with Declan Devine emphatic that his players give everything in these last two games, there should be plenty of entertainment at the Brandywell over the next few days. “Our aim is to win the last two games,” McNamee continued. “If Bohs win their last game it will go down to goal dference but we’re aiming for third place. “At the end of the day fourth place gets Europe so we have got to nail that down on Tuesday night andwe win that and beat Harps hopefully we’ll get third place as well. Obviously our objective is to finish third but next seasonwe’re playing in Europe no-one will careyou finish third or fourth. “The boys in there just don’t give up. You saw tonight again when we went behind we came back. Over the years at Derry whenever you went behind it wasn’t too often you came back again. “There’s a great character in the group and a never say die attitude and that’s all you can ask for.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two goals in three minutes from substitute James Doona sealed the points for the Dubliners who now move to just two points behind Derry City in fourth place with one league game remaining.  After a forgettable first half, Derry got the goal the game desperately needed on  minutes when Ciaran Coll raced into the area and as Clarke came out to narrow the angle, he simply rolled the ball across the face of goal for David Parkhouse to slot home his th goal of the season. googletag.cmd.push The game was now more open and it did not take St. Pat’s long to level the game when Ian Bermingham’s shot deflected kindly into the path of Chris Forrester who turned and fired low past Cherrie into the net to make it -. The final  minutes were extremely tense with the game in the balance but Derry came within inches of restoring their lead when Junior released McDonagh on the right and his low ball shot right across the face of goal with no Derry player there to touch it into the net. The Brandywell was stunned into silence however as St. Pat’s scored two goals in three minutes to seal the win. Substitute James Doona, on the pitch a matter of moments, raced clear of the Derry defence and sent the ball past Peter Cherrie who didn’t move as the ball rolled past him into the net. Derry tried hard to respond but they were stunned again when Pat’s broke after Darren McCauley lost the ball in an advanced position and Jake Walker picked out Doona who got in behind again and slotted the ball past Cherrie to seal the win for the visitors.  Teams:- DERRY CITY: Peter Cherrie, Grant Gillespie , Eoin Toal, Ally Gilchrist, Ciaran Coll, Ciaron Harkin , Barry McNamee , Greg Sloggett, Jamie McDonagh, Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, David Parkhouse. ST. PATRICK’S ATHLETIC: Brendan Clarke, Ciaran Kelly, Dean Clarke, Ian Bermingham, Cian Coleman , Lee Desmond, Darragh Markey , Chris Forrester, Jamie Lennon, Ronan Hale, Gary Shaw .

When funding for the bypass has been confirmed, the piece of art will be fabricated.The news comes after it was confirmed recently that the Department of Finance is expected to approve the new roadrsquos economic appraisal by December which is viewed as a critical step in the process ahead of the required capital funding being released.While the required funding has not yet been made available, local politicians are hoping that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on site.The Department of Infrastructure says the preparation of the schemersquos economic appraisal report is continuing with Department of Finance approval for the document due to be sought before the end of the year.In order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents is ongoing in a bid to minimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.As part of the proposed multi-million pound development, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road. A new bridge will be constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass mdash which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district mdash is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Roads officials are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the bypass would provide a good economic ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Children.jpg","title":"Children from integrated schools listen talk  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH school played host to a conference to mark World Mental Health Day last Thursday.Over  young people from  integrated schools across the province converged on Drumlins Integrated Primary School to take part in lsquoListeningrsquo mdash an event organised by the Integrated Education Fund.The compere was BBC presenter Jo Scott ands guest speakers included Mr Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health, and Kate Beggs, from the Northern Ireland Director of National Lottery Community Fund.Mr Pengelly said afterwards: ldquoYoung people are faced with a number of pressures including social media influences. Online bullying and exam pressure have all contributed to rising levels of anxiety and stress.ldquoIt is important we equip and educate our young people to deal with these issues and to look after their mental health.ldquoThere is support and help available for young people and their families and I urge them to avail of these services.Following talks delivered by young key note speakers, pupils discussed their views on the stresses and anxieties faced by young people.Participants were facilitated in small groups to share their thoughts and generated ideas to help develop support within their schools.Among those taking part were Kori Colgan-Murphy, a GCSE student at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, who has been a member of the schoolrsquos Gender Sexuality Alliancegroup for a number of years.ldquoThe GSA is open to all students including LGBTQ students and their allies, she said. ldquoIt is a place where students can come together to socialise, discuss issues, and support one another.Paul Collins, campaign fundraiser with the Integrated Education Fund, said: ldquoSchools in Northern Ireland have seen a dramatic increase in the number of young people with mental health issues.ldquoThese could be anxiety or panic attacks, stress and depression, eating disorders and even, as we sadly know suicidal thoughts.ldquoThe aim of this conference is to provide an open environment to listen to children and young people.ldquoTeachers and parents need to find out what mental health issues are affecting young people in order to provide them with access to the right type of support.ldquoOn the basis of the group discussions, we hope to develop and deliver a plan that can help to address the mental issues impacting on our young people and their wellbeing..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Dads.jpg","title":"Dads helping autistic children enjoy their favourite sports with new project  ","story":"FOOTBALL is often a rite of passage sport for many young boys and girls but for children with autism, taking part in mainstream clubs or school activities can be overwhelming.Two local fathers are trying to make participation a lot easier and stress-free for their children to enjoy this team sport.Gerard McCartan and Daniel Craig from Downpatrick are just two of the many fully involved members of Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group.They have been taking a group of  local children aged between six and with autism for a specially adapted football course for the last three weeks at the Ballymote Sports and Wellbeing Centre.Devised by Gerard, who works for Disability Sport NI, the course aims to build skills in incremental levels in a way which focuses on enjoyment.Gerardrsquos eldest child Cahaacuten, , has autism and was diagnosed just before he went to primary school. He and his we, who are committee members of the support group, have have always tried to integrate activities and sports for all of their three children.ldquoI didnrsquot want football to be a negative experience for my son or any other child, said Gerard. ldquoTeam sports such as football can be overwhelming for children with autism either in school or any local clubs but that doesnot mean they should not be able to participate.Gerard said that he has devised the five-week course which helps build up football skills at the appropriate level for each child.It will finish with a match of children playing against their parents in two weeks time.ldquoNinety-two percent of children with autism have a sensory processing delay so as coaches being able to communicate effectively to the children in a way that they can understand is important, explained Gerard. ldquoWe give the kids reward cards so they and their parents can see their progression which builds up to the match.ldquoThe parents are a brilliant support as some of the children would get very anxious but to have their parents there beside them makes it possible. With the added bit of theatre and drama we try to instil, it heightens the whole experience for them and helps to make memories for both.Gerard hopes to devise further sports courses for autistic children such as boxing.Aacuteine Sloan, chairperson, of the group, praised the contribution of the fathers, not just for helping their own children but for other local children with autism whose parents are members.She said: ldquoNot only is it fantastic that a programme of its kind is now available locally but that itrsquos down to two dads who took it upon themselves to fill the gap.ldquoDownpatrick Autism Family Support Group is % run by parents. Wersquore delighted that Gerard and Daniel have developed this programme so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers. The children can enjoy football in a relaxed and non-judgmental environment.Ms Sloan said that many children on the autism spectrum cannot attend the usual football sessions due to crowds, noises, dficulty following instructions and other considerations.She added: ldquoThis now gives these children the same chance as their peers.This is just one of the many programmes we have running at the minute. We currently have Lego therapy, pony therapy, occupationaltherapy and ious parent training nights.ldquoWe would urge any local families pre and post diagnosis who need some extra support to get in touch via our Facebook page at Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Down.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre goes from strength to strength  ","story":"THE success story at the new Down Leisure Centre continues with ious user targets set ahead of its official opening almost one year ago being smashed.Local council officials have revealed that user numbers are ldquoextremely high with membership of the fitness suite particularly impressive.However, the huge demand to use the ultra-modern poundm facility is causing problems for council officials. One of the issues which has arisen is the number of classes it can host and the number of people who can be accommodated in each.Council officials are going to examine the issue, alongside extending the hugely popular leisure centrersquos opening hours.In addition, they are also going to focus on expanding the health referral service which enables GPs to refer people to the leisure centre to engage in fitness-related activities.Over recent months, the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Department has been liaising with the Public Health Agency and local health trusts to look at helping address key areas including diabetes prevention.New staff are to be appointed with the posts jointly funded by the health trusts and local authority.

To allow school use of the pool the running costs would jump from pound, to pound, and receipts would only normally be expected to rise by pound,, leaving an additional deficit of pound,.Negotiations are currently in progress with the South Eastern Education and Library Board but councillors are clearly determined not to allow school use unless the Board agree to pay the additional pound, deficit.If the Board agree to pay for school use the pool will open each morning, otherwise it will be open only in the afternoons and evenings.The councilrsquos recreation committee has already accepted a timetable for pool openings and have agreed to open doors from .pm to .pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursday and Fridays.On Wednesdays it will open from .pm to .pm for public use and will re-open between .pm and .pm for the use of recognised swimming clubs.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinch Business and Professional Womenrsquos Club have written to South Down MP Enoch Powell in connection with the proposed changes in immigration procedures.The club, having been informed through the United Kingdom Federation of B and P Clubs, who were told by Baroness Lockwood of the Equal Commission, want action taken before the proposals are passed by the government.The proposals, that British women wishing to marry foreigners will have to live abroad whilst British men will still be able to marry foreign girls and live in Britain with them, were discussed at greatby the meeting, before it was decided that the secretary should contact Mr Powell.The guest speaker at the clubrsquos recent meeting was Mrs A Nixon, who gave a talk on lsquoHow to be a Good Hostessrsquo.ARDGLASS mdash Ardglass Castle has been put on the market and the asking price is around pound,.The castle, which is believed to have been built in the th century, has  bedrooms and it is thought that one of its guests was the famous songwriter and painter Percy French.Many believe that the talented Frenchman painted several views of Ardglass harbour from the Castle.Other interesting guests, this time more recently were an order of monks who stayed in the castle in the late s and early s.The current landlords, Sean and Bernadette Tracey, and their three children are sorry to be leaving the castle. Sean had ideas to convert it into a hotel and restaurant and there is already planning permission for such a venture.The Fermanagh-born hotelier is moving his interest to another establishment although this time he is tight-lipped about its whereabouts.Sean is aware that most castles are expected to have at least one respectable ghost and he admits that there are many stories locally about ghosts in the castle but during his time living there he never heard had any experience of them.ldquoAlthough the premises are licensed for spirits mdash I think they are of a dferent kind, he

in the new year, said Jim.ldquoThese will again be dferent bloodlines as a follow up to the making of a small but very well bred herd.ldquoCrossed with our own native goals they will produce a very tough healthy race of goats capable of yields upwards of two gallons, which is certainly well worthwhile.Jimrsquos present stud goat, Swaffham Salvador, was a reserve champion out of an entry of  goals at the Royal Norfolk Show.Jim has also imported a Soanen male whose dam was a Q Star goat breed champion.His other stud is a British Soanen bred over a gallon of milk with a minimum fat content of % in less than  hours.ldquoOne of the big markets has come from the growth of health food shops who are creating a demand for goals milk, said Jim.In charging pound stud fees, Jim believes that it

As you would expect, the course had become a virtual mud bath by that stage and there was a lot of fallers.Finn Gibney ran well to take th place in the same boysrsquo race, which had a field of  finishers and Ky Murray also did well to take th place out of  finishers in the girlsrsquo race.Masters trialsThe weekend saw the Masters cross-country trials take place at the Queenrsquos playing fields. The weather was almost too good for it to feel like cross country with brilliant sunshine and little wind.The well kept grounds enticed one runner to go barefoot which was slightly disconcerting for the remainder wearing spikes, but maybe that was a tactic to get clear passage as the others were afraid to cause him injury.The conditions underfoot may have been kind, but the course was taxing with four long loops and a few rises and s where tactics played a part.Mark winsIt was no surprise to see Mark McKinstry, from North Belfast, surge into the lead from the go, given his recent form, but it was still impressive to watch how hard he continued to push despite the clear gap.Second overall was Eamon White, from the same club, with Glenn Donnelly, of Acorns AC, in third. As this race was a trial for selection for the NI team for the British and Irish XC International in Southport in November, all were out to seethey could do well enough in their age groups to merit a place.Three EDAC runners were in the mix. Neil Curran ran a great race, going out hard and hanging on mdash a tactic which worked extremely well. He was th overall and fourth in his age category, so stands a good chance of making the team.Martin Willcox, a previous NI team member at the international event, also put his hat in the ring with a gutsy run, coming th and third in his category which should see him nominated to race.Confirmation was not out at the time of writing, but we will keep our fingers crossed for them both. Gareth Reilly was th overall, getting his cross country season off to a solid start.Soggy SaintfieldAs rain swept in overnight and just kept coming, there was the danger of a wash out for the long awaited Saintfield  k, but runners are a resilient lot and so they turned up nonetheless, ready to enjoy the carnival atmosphere laid on by the hardworking members of Saintfield Striders and other coned volunteers.It was no secret that this is a tough route. Described as a challenge, the k started outside the cricket club, rises up into the town, rises again up Main Street and rises yet again after the left turn which takes the runners out into the countryside.Asthat wasnrsquot enough, there are at least three more hills which take their toll, but there are occasional down hills to catch your breath and the biggest compensation of all is the final mile and a half which drops down into the finish.Edie in frontThe pacers were encouraging and the marshals were cheery, so there was plenty to keep runners on track, whether they were chasing a time or just hoping to finish.EDAC had a small, but determined army. First home for EDAC was Edie Carroll, who thoroughly enjoyed the run and finished th overall and eighth female in a time of . which is more than respectable on that course.Kevin Kelly, who has racked up some great racing en route to Dublin Marathon, ran a PBwhich is a real boost in these last couple of weeks of his prep.Clare Carson, also in taper, produced a good time of ..

to -.That victory ensured Downpatrick of a play-off spot and also ped Bryansford into the relegation mire mdash Bryansford won their first meeting at St Patrickrsquos Park - to -.Saturdayrsquos confrontation will be a no holds barred confrontation.Derby affairs between these two old adversaries are always tasty and no quarter will be asked for or given at the weekend.Bryansford will rely heavily on the experience of Davy McKibben, Conor Maginn, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Timmy Hanna, with Downpatrick looking to Gerard Collins, the Turley brothers, Peter and Damian and Jarlath Branagan.Downpatrick received a massive boost last week when Conor McGrady, who was expected to miss the rest of the season, made a remarkably early comeback as a substitute in the game against Bryansford mdash his appearance from the start could be a game-changer on Saturday.Meanwhile, Downpatrickrsquos close neighbours will take on Saval in a Division  relegation play-off, also on Saturday at St Malachyrsquos Park and will act as a curtain-raiser to the ACFL  clash.Saul looked destined a few weeks back to join Tullylish and one other team in Division  next season, but last-gasp victories in recent weeks over Saval and then Darragh Cross on Saturday have given Ronan McCartanrsquos side a leline.Darragh did Saul a favour last Wednesday night when they beat Liatroim, effectively condemning the Fontenoys to Division .Saul mdash in their first season in Division  mdash have a mixed bag of youth and experience, but could well have to beat Saval without the services of the talented Cormac Byrne, out with a knee injury.However, in Cathail Arnold, Lorcan and Ciaran Harney, Pierce Laverty and Rory Mullen they have the players capable of producing the goods when it matters most.Elsewhere, Dromara play St John Bosco tonight in a Division  relegation play-off at Tullylish with the losers joining Glasdrumman in Division  next season.Bright embark on their initial Ulster Club Championship odyssey with a game against Cavan JFC winners Killinkere at Kingspan Breffni on Sunday andthey can replicate the form shown against Aughlisnafin in the JFC final.To complete a hectic weekend, the action s to Pairc Esler on Sunday where the MFC final replay between Kilcoo and Burren takes place with a .pm start..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo recapture Frank O’Hare Cup  ","story":"CILL Chua regained the Frank OrsquoHare Cup at Pairc Esler on Sunday with a relentless and masterful display of controlled football.The hurt of last yearrsquos defeat to Burren was confined to history as the Kilcoo players and supporters celebrated with unbridled joy on the final whistle.All credit to Warrenpoint for playing their part in an intriguing contest that so could easily have gone either way, but they were made to pay for registering  wides over the hour.As expected, Niall McAleenanrsquos side took the game to Kilcoo with real authority and at times threatened to destroy their vaunted opponents.However, you just canrsquot tie Kilcoo down and they steadfastly refused to be dominated for long periods.With just two minutes on the clock Ryan Mallon gave Warrenpoint the lead with a point from play after some patient approach work. The same player then had a glorious chance for a goal when he got in behind the Kilcoo full back line, but lsquokeeper Martin McCourt made a brilliant save.The lsquoPoint continued to see plenty of the ball with corner forward Aron DrsquoArcy foraging deep, but they wasted a few kickable frees before Kilcoorsquos Ryan McEvoy brought the sides level with a free in the ninth minute.Ross McGarry then found his range and exchanged frees with Paul Devlin before the Kilcoo marksman punished Warrenpoint for another defensive indiscretion with his second point in quick succession.Ryan Johnston started seeing a lot more of the ball for Kilcoo, but it was Warrenpoint who drew level the th minute with a well-taken score from Ruairi McCormack.McGarry pointed Warrenpoint into a - to - lead after  minutes, but Kilcoo responded immediately with a m free from McCourt.Ryan Johnston then went on a searing run down the right flank and bore down on goal, but flashed his shot wide of Gary McMahonrsquos far post when he really should have tested the lsquokeeper.Devlin and McGarry swapped frees as the interval approached, but their was still time for the energetic Aidan Branagan to bomb forward from his full back berth to point Kilcoo into a - to - half-time lead.Warrenpoint were certainly not overawed by Kilcoo and started the second half the same way they attacked from the opening whistle of the game, but it was Kilcoo who edged into a - to - lead after  minutes with another score from the rampaging Ward.A McGarry free quickly negated this score before Kilcoo received a bad blow when Darryl Branagan was black carded and replaced by Shealan Johnston in the th minute.McGarry converted the resultant free to bring the sides level, but the game was really opening up at this stage and McMahon prevented a certain goal at the other end when he saved from Aiden Branagan.Warrenpoint went straight back on the attack and McGarry gave them a - to - lead with  minutes remaining. Devlin then brought the sides level with a rsquo after a Jerome Johnston shot went perilously close.Ryan McEvoy and Anton Magill swapped scores to keep it all square going into the last  minutes, but Warrenpoint kicked for home when John Boyle majestically pointed his side into a - to - lead.Kilcoo responded with venom. Conor Laverty, who had been on the periphery of the game up until this stage, suddenly took centre stage.Nothing looked on when he received the ball about m from goal. However, he checked back inside his marker and somehow spotted Wardrsquos run from deep.An improvised flick-pass, albeit with the aid of a deflection, picked out the big midfielder and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past McMahon.That should have finished Warrenpoint off, but far from it.They immediately attacked in numbers and worked an opening for McGarry, but he sent his effort wide with the goal at his mercy.A McGarry free gave Warrenpoint some consolation and left a single point between the sides with  minutes played.The game was still anybodyrsquos, but consecutive scores from McEvoy and Jerome and Ryan Johnston seemed to put daylight between the entities with  minutes gone.Another McGarry free cut the deficit to three points as the game went into added time. Warrenpoint continued to bombard Kilcoo and further points from Donagh McAleenan and McGarry left a point in it, but Kilcoo won dirty ball when it mattered and ran the clock down to run out worthy winners.Kilcoo: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Aidan Branagan , Niall McEvoy, Aaron Branagan, Darryl Branagan, Miceal Rooney, Ryan McEvoy , Dylan Ward , Anthony Morgan, Paul Devlin , Ryan Johnston , Eugene Branagan, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty.

It was crazy. Amber was born in her whole sac, she continued.ldquoI did what the midwives told me to do because she was in the water [the sac]. I was already in early labour when I went for a hospital appointment but while they wanted me to stay, I said that I would rather go back home as I wanted to do everything as natural.ldquoThey advised me not to come back in until my waters broke but they didnrsquot break. I came back around .pm and Amber was born two hours later.

The midwe had to break the sac but Amber also seemed to reach out at the same time with her hand. It was just so special to see.Amber, who is now six days old and is thriving well, is one of a number of famous people down through the centuries who share this honour of being born in the lsquocaulrsquo mdash the thin membrane which covers the baby and its amniotic fluid.Emperors and leaders such Alexander the Great, King Charlemagne, Napoleon, the poet Lord Byron and father of modern psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, and the late flamboyant entertainer Liberace, are all reputed to have been born this way.Seen in many cultures as portentously luckyborn ldquowith a veil over the face, the child is meant to have a lelong affinity with water.A spokesperson for South Eastern Trust which manages the Lagan Valley hospital, confirmed the auspicious delivery.ldquoThis patient laboured naturally and her waters remained unbroken so as a result the baby was born in the amniotic sac.

He recalls that his mystical experience revealed to him that all people are mutually interdependent and all people are essentially good.Signicantly, the revelation led to him leaving his study of medicine and immersing himself in the study of psychology, social anthropology, sociology and African languages. And, during university vacations, Stan engaged in so-called participant observation research as a nursing assistant in psychiatric hospitals.He also played music with an African group known as lsquoThe Kirela Kidsrsquo, two of whose members, Robert and Joshua Sithole were proclaimed to be a foremost penny-whistler and second best guitarist in South Africa respectively at a jazz awards ceremony.It was through these musiciansthat Stan met his future we, Selin Mahlvane, who was herself a singer of traditional African music and a jazz singer.In , the author was awarded both BA and a BSc Science degrees, also receiving a bursary for being the top sociology student which resulted in his engaging in further studies, leading to him receiving an honours degree.After this, Stan engaged in further participant observation studies, this time as a lsquopretending patientrsquo in a mental hospital in Swaziland, subsequently writing this research up as a thesis, entitled, ldquoSituations: a model for the analysis of mental hospital practicesrsquorsquo. He received PhD degree for this research.While he was in Swaziland, Stan married Selin, a black South African. Such a marriage was illegal in South Africa and was banned under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. The couplersquos son, Kenneth, was born in Swaziland and was smuggled across the border into South Africa and itrsquos this backstory which forms the genesis of his new book.Already an acclaimed author, Stan argues that the reason psychiatric hospitals and psychiatry were so signicant was because the way hospitals treated patients was equivalent to the way black people were classied and dominated in apartheid South Africa.All this is described in his new book, along with a way to evaluate the therapeutic value or lack of value in staff-patient interactions.When Stan came to Northern Ireland, he became a clinical psychologist, working in psychiatric hospitals. He was also the co-founder of a self-help group for mastering anxiety, panic and stress.Some of the background to this group is contained in his new book, as well as in another publication entitled lsquoSoul On Firersquorsquo mdash a guide to mastering anxiety, which is also available on Amazon.Together with the process of mastering anxiety, Stan also engaged in research into overcoming depression, put together in a book entitled lsquoRising from the Deadrsquo and the process of recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, contained in lsquoVictory of the Spiritrsquo.All this, he says, forms part of an understanding of the radical alternative to psychiatric colonialism.ldquoThe worst part of psychiatry lies in its process of diagnosing so-called mental illness, along with its prescribing of drugs, supposedly for correcting and lsquochemical imbalance in the brainrsquo says the author.Dr Papenfus illustrates that such a chemical imbalance does not exist. In fact, he argues that the ldquofraud involved in creating and medical basis for psychiatry is no more than a myth and there is shown in great detail in the book.Also demonstrated in great depth is what the author describes as the ldquounscientic basis of pharmaceutical companies supposed lsquotestingrsquo of prescribed psychiatric drugs.ldquoThis fraudulence results in millions of peoplersquos lives being ruined, year after year and in one country after another, said Dr Papenfus.ldquoEven children are now becoming a huge market for prescribed psychiatric drugs and some of their extremely dangerous effects are described. The research involved in this exposure calls for a dramatic and urgent response. This is what lsquoRenewing our Livesrsquorsquo provides.Between  and , Dr William Barrington was the leading psychiatrist at the Downshire Hospital in Downpatrick. According to Dr Papenfus, it was during these years that traditional bio-psychiatry was replaced with social psychiatry.ldquoUnder his guidance therapy always included a social dimension, said the author. ldquoGoals were formulated and realised. The personal empowerment of patients included regular reviews of what was going on and how everyone was making sense of everyone .ldquoThe result was that the Downshire Hospital was widely regarded as the best psychiatric facility in Europe. Because Dr Barringtonrsquos way of working was still strikingly held by many nurses, social workers and others, this is what persuaded me to come to work in the Downshire in .But, when he arrived, the author claimed that the ideology of the medical model of mental illness was in force once again and ldquothe dehumanising processes of bio-psychiatry was prominent once more.Despite this, the author says a transformation was still possible ands this is the hope behind his new book.Two copies of the new book have been placed in Downpatrick Library and it is also available on order, from Amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Roy.jpg","title":"Roy Living healthy life to win coveted NI fitness accolade  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Roy Livingstone has won the Centra Action Cancer Endeavour Award at the Northern Ireland Health and Fitness Awards.The prestigious event sponsored by Centra mdash held at Belfastrsquos Crowne Plaza and attended by  guests mdash celebrated the outstanding achievements of the local health and fitness industry.The awards were presented by TV personality and fitness advocate Vogue Williams and Q Radiorsquos Ibe Sesay.Roy has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help raise much-needed funds for Centrarsquos charity partner, Action Cancer, cycling from London to Paris and, most recently, a -mile cycle in San Francisco.Congratulating the Portaferry man on his win, Jenner Morton, Centra brand manager, said that over the years, Roy ldquoreally has gone the extra mile when it comes to fundraising for Action Cancer.She continued: ldquoFrom his cycles in Paris and San Francisco alongside local events and initiatives, Roy and the wider team at Centra in Portaferry have made a real impact with the funds they have raised.ldquoFrom everyone at Centra, wersquod like to say a big thank you to Roy.Funds raised by Centrarsquos customers go towards funding the health action programme which educates children of all ages about leading healthier lestyles as well as Action Cancerrsquos so-called big bus which travels across the Province driving home early cancer detection..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Traders.jpg","title":"Traders offered input into Irish Street scheme  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick are to be given a key input into ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy, with both organisations working alongside the Provincersquos Strategic Investment Board.Last week, the Recorder revealed that a development brief designed to transform the sprawling town centre site as part of a multi-million pound investment was being progressed, with hopes that the document could be completed before the end of the year.During Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee,council officials confirmed that town centre traders, Downpatrick councillors and relevant public agencies will be involved in discussions to guide the development brief process.When the brief has been agreed, it will be advertised, inviting developers to come forward to transform the site to kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.A formal launch of the brief is also planned before Christmas.Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains are reported to be interested in opening new premises in Downpatrick and view Irish Street as an ideal location as there are currently no other suitable sites available.The development brief will outline what the local authority would like to see developed in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Permission has also been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the Irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.It is understood that as part of the regeneration scheme, the vacant buildings adjacent to the former police base will be bulldozed to open up a huge area. The development site also includes the council-owned Irish Street car park.However, the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious regeneration plan and is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed progress on developing the brief for the Irish Street redevelopment.Cllr Curran, who has been asking for traders to be involved with helping shape the development brief, is delighted this is going to happen to help shape the future development of the Irish Street site.He said it is critical all key stakeholders are involved in what will be the biggest ever investment in the town centre.Cllr Curran believes that with everyone on board at this early stage, the planned new retail and commercial centre has a signicant chance of succeeding, providing a boost for all businesses in the town.ldquoThis planned development can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses who have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for generations, he said.ldquoWhile details of the Irish Street scheme were announced almost two years ago, signicant progress is now being made. I have no doubt that the opportunity to redevelop a major town centre will appeal to many in the construction industry.Cllr Curran said the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town cannot be overstated.Cllr Hanlon agreed that the redevelopment proposal will provide Downpatrick with a much-needed economic boost and welcomed plans to form a stakeholder group to feed into the development brief.She added: ldquoThis forum will be open to all Downpatrick businesses and I would encourage their participation and views to ensure that all ideas are heard and considered.

But such was his passion for Down that there was no way he was going to miss the game.ldquoFor me, that said much about the man he was. He ran the risk of maybe breaking down but through sheer willpower, courage and strength of character he came out triumphant.Doherty, one of the true GAA legends, said Eamonn Burns was never one to look for sympathy or seek comfort.ldquoHe stood on his own two feet and took what came at him. And when the going got tough he was always in there doing his bit for the cause. When you have a man like Eamonn in your corner, how could you fail to come out on top  he continued.Paddy Mo added: ldquoEamonn was a legend. Not just because he was a whole-hearted player who gave everything for the cause at club and county levels, but because he was as honest as the day is long.ldquoHe was a wonderful ambassador for our Association, honourable, dignied and respectful. In my book he was a true legend because of the person that he was. He has left a rich legacy both in a playing context and in the way he carried himself. His memory will linger on.Another colleague of the double All-Ireland winner, Conor Deegan, said he was left ldquonumb and devastated when he learnt of Eamonnrsquos passing.He added: ldquoWe are absolutely destroyed. Only a few weeks ago we were together at Croke Park. He took on the county job when it was not fashionable but nothing was ever about Eamonn there was just no ego with him.

There were breathtaking displays of riders with hoops and torches on fire, made all the more spectacular against the back of the floodlit castle.ldquoThe finale involved le-size inflatable horses, which were manipulated by dancers who moved with the music that filled the air. A spectacular display of culture for all to enjoy.On Sunday morning, the group viewed a historic presentation prepared by one of the historic and cultural associations in Lamorlaye.Ms Patterson explained: ldquoWe were then taken on a walking tour of the old Lamorlaye. The afternoon was free for the group to view a dressage display with ballet dancers at the Diane Stables. There was also a beautul show with Samurai warriors on horseback.ldquoThe activities just went on and on and the group was treated to a visit to a wine-making area in Gouvieux before being taken to the troglodyte quarter of Gouvieux and for a surprise dinner in a cave.The dinner was prepared by member of the committee and made all the more special because of the sing-song started by Herveacute Moula, chairwoman of the Lamorlaye Comiteacute de Jumelage, supported by Cllr Andrews and guests from Ballynahinch. The atmosphere was relaxed and this was the end to a lovely day.On the final day of the visit, the group was invited to view the facilities at the Golf du Lys, an exclusive golf course, which has facilities to host conferences, weddings and events, along with outdoor and indoor tennis courts, an outdoor pool and golf courses.Ms Patterson said: ldquoThe golf club has already hosted some players from Ballynahinch and they have asked uswe are interested in organising a reciprocal golf tournament with the local golf courses in Co Down.ldquoWe hope we will be able to take them up on this proposal when the French visit us in .ldquoOur final lunch was in a redundant factory complex which has been converted in to a stunning hotel and restaurant ndash testament to how an old property can be re-generated for the good of the community.ldquoThe programme for the weekend provided us with ample opportunity to meet up with those who had travelled over to Ballynahinch in July and to meet with some old faces from previous exchanges between Lamorlaye and Ballynahinch. It is our hope we will be able to sign a twinning charter with both the local council for the next five to ten years.Ms Patterson said that the two pilot exchange trips have shown the relationship is still as vibrant as ever, with new people getting involved on both sides.She added: ldquoWe are hoping to be in a position to host a small group over the St Patrickrsquos weekend and to take a small group out to Lamorlaye for the Bastille Day celebrations. We always welcome new families who would be interested in hosting French people and who would be interested in travelling out to France as part of the exchange.ldquoThose travelling pay for their own flights and the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group has facilitated the visits through the generous support of Newry Mourne and Down Council. We would also like to thank Cllr Robert Burgess for helping us to revive the Lamorlaye Twinning Project and Cllr Andrews for representing the local council and accompanying the group to Lamorlaye and for his rendition of the Marseillaise in French..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/9653973.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bandstand adam doherty","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whatrsquos the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band Do you have any gigs coming up Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth.
