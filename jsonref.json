This will be put in law. The police can take action against you if you leave home without a \u0027reasonable excuse\u0027, and issue you with a fine (Fixed Penalty Notice).You can be given a Fixed Penalty Notice of £200 for the first offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of £6,400.A \u0027reasonable excuse\u0027 includes:Work - you can only leave home for work purposes where it is unreasonable for you to do your job from home, including but not limited to people who work within critical national infrastructure, construction or manufacturing that require in-person attendanceVolunteering - you can also leave home to provide voluntary or charitable services.Essential activities - you can leave home to buy things at shops or obtain services. You may also leave your home to do these things on behalf of a disabled or vulnerable person or someone self-isolating.Education and childcare - You can only leave home for education, registered childcare, and supervised activities for children where they are eligible to attend. Access to education and children\u0027s activities for school-aged pupils is restricted. See further information on education and childcare. People can continue existing arrangements for contact between parents and children where they live apart. This includes childcare bubbles.Meeting others and care - You can leave home to visit people in your support bubble ( if you are legally permitted to form one), to provide informal childcare for children under 14 as part of a childcare bubble (for example, to enable parents to work, and not to enable social contact between adults), to provide care for disabled or vulnerable people, to provide emergency assistance, to attend a support group (of up to 15 people), or for respite care where that care is being provided to a vulnerable person or a person with a disability, or is a short break in respect of a looked-after child.Exercise - You can continue to exercise alone, with one other person or with your household or support bubble. This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area.You should maintain social distancing. See exercising and meeting other people.Medical reasons - You can leave home for a medical reason, including to get a COVID-19 test, for medical appointments and emergencies.Harm and compassionate visits - you can leave home to be with someone who is giving birth, to avoid injury or illness or to escape risk of harm (such as domestic abuse). You can also leave home to visit someone who is dying or someone in a care home (if permitted under care home guidance), hospice, or hospital, or to accompany them to a medical appointment.Animal welfare reasons – you can leave home for animal welfare reasons, such as to attend veterinary services for advice or treatment.Communal worship and life events - You can leave home to attend or visit a place of worship for communal worship, a funeral or event related to a death, a burial ground or a remembrance garden, or to attend a wedding ceremony. You should follow the guidance on the safe use of places of worship and must not mingle with anyone outside of your household or support bubble when attending a place of worship.Weddings, funerals and religious, belief-based or commemorative events linked to someone\u0027s death are all subject to limits on the numbers that can attend, and weddings and civil ceremonies may only take place in exceptional circumstances.There are further reasonable excuses. For example, you may leave home to fulfil legal obligations or to carry out activities related to buying, selling, letting or renting a residential property, or where it is reasonably necessary for voting in an election or referendum.Exercising and meeting other peopleYou should minimise time spent outside your home.It is against the law to meet socially with family or friends unless they are part of your household or support bubble. You can only leave your home to exercise, and not for the purpose of recreation or leisure (e.g. a picnic or a social meeting). This should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area.You can exercise in a public outdoor place:by yourselfwith the people you live withwith your support bubble (if you are legally permitted to form one)in a childcare bubble where providing childcareor, when on your own, with 1 person from another householdPublic outdoor places include:parks, beaches, countryside accessible to the public, forestspublic gardens (whether or not you pay to enter them)the grounds of a heritage siteplaygroundsOutdoor sports venues, including tennis courts, golf courses and swimming pools, must close.When around other people, stay 2 metres apart from anyone not in your household - meaning the people you live with - or your support bubble. Where this is not possible, stay 1 metre apart with extra precautions (e.g. wearing a face covering).You must wear a face covering in many indoor settings, such as shops or places of worship where these remain open, and on public transport, unless you are exempt. This is the law. Read guidance on face coverings.Support and childcare bubblesYou have to meet certain eligibility rules to form a support or childcare bubble. This means not everyone will be able to form a bubble.A support bubble is a support network which links two households. You can form a support bubble with another household of any size only if you meet the eligibility rules.It is against the law to form a support bubble if you do not follow these rules.You are permitted to leave your home to visit your support bubble (and to stay overnight with them). However, if you form a support bubble, it is best if this is with a household who live locally. This will help prevent the virus spreading from an area where more people are infected.If you live in a household with anyone aged under 14, you can form a childcare bubble. This allows friends or family from one other household to provide informal childcare.You must not meet socially with your childcare bubble, and must avoid seeing members of your childcare and support bubbles at the same time.There is separate guidance for support bubbles and childcare bubbles.Where and when you can meet in larger groupsThere are still circumstances in which you are allowed to meet others from outside your household, childcare or support bubble in larger groups, but this should not be for socialising and only for permitted purposes. A full list of these circumstances will be included in the regulations, and includes:for work, or providing voluntary or charitable services, where it is unreasonable to do so from home. This can include work in other people\u0027s homes where necessary - for example, for nannies, cleaners, social care workers providing support to children and families, or tradespeople. See guidance on working safely in other people\u0027s homes). Where a work meeting does not need to take place in a private home or garden, it should not - for example, although you can meet a personal trainer, you should do so in a public outdoor place.in a childcare bubble (for the purposes of childcare only)Where eligible to use these services, for education, registered childcare, and supervised activities for children. Access to education and childcare facilities is restricted. See further information on education and childcare.for arrangements where children do not live in the same household as both their parents or guardiansto allow contact between birth parents and children in care, as well as between siblings in carefor prospective adopting parents to meet a child or children who may be placed with themto place or facilitate the placing of a child or children in the care of another by social servicesfor birth partnersto provide emergency assistance, and to avoid injury or illness, or to escape a risk of harm (including domestic abuse)to see someone who is dyingto fulfil a legal obligation, such as attending court or jury servicefor gatherings within criminal justice accommodation or immigration detention centresto provide care or assistance to someone vulnerable, or to provide respite for a carerfor a wedding or equivalent ceremony in exceptional circumstances and only for up to 6 peoplefor funerals - up to a maximum of 30 people. Wakes and other linked ceremonial events can continue in a group of up to 6 people.to visit someone at home who is dying, or to visit someone receiving treatment in a hospital, hospice or care home, or to accompany a family member or friend to a medical appointmentfor elite sportspeople (and their coaches if necessary, or parentsguardians if they are under 18) - or those on an official elite sports pathway - to compete and trainto facilitate a house moveSupport groups that have to be delivered in person can continue with up to 15 participants where formally organised to provide mutual aid, therapy or any other form of support - but they must take place at a premises other than a private home.Where a group includes someone covered by an exception (for example, someone who is working or volunteering), they are not generally counted as part of the gatherings limit. This means, for example, a tradesperson can go into a household without breaching the limit, if they are there for work, and the officiant at a wedding would not count towards the limit.If you break the rulesThe police can take action against you if you meet in larger groups. This includes breaking up illegal gatherings and issuing fines (fixed penalty notices).You can be given a Fixed Penalty Notice of £200 for the first offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of £6,400. If you hold, or are involved in holding, an illegal gathering of over 30 people, the police can issue fines of £10,000.Protecting people more at risk from coronavirusIf you are clinically vulnerable, you could be at higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. There is additional advice for people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus. Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable should not attend work, school, college or university, and limit the time you spend outside the home. You should only go out for medical appointments, exercise or if it is essential.TravelYou must not leave your home unless you have a reasonable excuse (for example, for work or education purposes). If you need to travel you should stay local – meaning avoiding travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live – and look to reduce the number of journeys you make overall. The list of reasons you can leave your home and area include, but are not limited to:work, where you cannot reasonably work from homeaccessing education and for caring responsibilitiesvisiting those in your support bubble – or your childcare bubble for childcarevisiting hospital, GP and other medical appointments or visits where you have had an accident or are concerned about your healthbuying goods or services that you need, but this should be within your local area wherever possibleoutdoor exercise. This should be done locally wherever possible, but you can travel a short distance within your area to do so if necessary (for example, to access an open space)attending the care and exercise of an animal, or veterinary servicesIf you need to travel, walk or cycle where possible, and plan ahead and avoid busy times and routes on public transport. This will allow you to practice social distancing while you travel.Avoid car sharing with anyone from outside your household or your support bubble. See the guidance on car sharing.If you need to use public transport, you should follow the safer travel guidance.International travelYou can only travel internationally – or within the UK – where you first have a legally permitted reason to leave home. In addition, you should consider the public health advice in the country you are visiting.If you do need to travel overseas (and are legally permitted to do so, for example, because it is for work), even if you are returning to a place you\u0027ve visited before, you should look at the rules in place at your destination and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) travel advice.UK residents currently abroad do not need to return home immediately. However, you should check with your airline or travel operator on arrangements for returning.Foreign nationals are subject to the \u0027Stay at Home\u0027 regulations. You should not travel abroad unless it is permitted. This means you must not go on holiday.If you are visiting the UK, you may return home. You should check whether there are any restrictions in place at your destination.Staying away from home overnightYou cannot leave your home or the place where you are living for holidays or overnight stays unless you have a reasonable excuse for doing so. This means that holidays in the UK and abroad are not allowed.This includes staying in a second home or caravan, if that is not your primary residence. This also includes staying with anyone who you don\u0027t live with unless they\u0027re in your support bubble.You are allowed to stay overnight away from your home if you:are visiting your support bubbleare unable to return to your main residenceneed accommodation while moving houseneed accommodation to attend a funeral or related commemorative eventrequire accommodation for work purposes or to provide voluntary servicesare a child requiring accommodation for school or careare homeless, seeking asylum, a vulnerable person seeking refuge, or if escaping harm (including domestic abuse)are an elite athlete or their support staff or parent, if the athlete is under 18 and it is necessary to be outside of the home for training or competitionIf you are already on holiday, you should return to your home as soon as practical.Guest accommodation providers such as hotels, B\u0026ampBs and caravan parks may remain open for the specific reasons set out in law, including where guests are unable to return to their main residence, use that guest accommodation as their main residence, need accommodation while moving house, are self-isolating as required by law, or would otherwise be made homeless as a result of the accommodation closing. A full list of reasons can be found in the guidance on closing certain businesses and venues in England.Accommodation providers are also encouraged to work cooperatively with local authorities to provide accommodation to vulnerable groups, including the homeless.Going to workYou may only leave your home for work if you cannot reasonably work from home.Where people cannot work from home - including, but not limited to, people who work in critical national infrastructure, construction, or manufacturing - they should continue to travel to their workplace. This is essential to keeping the country operating and supporting sectors and employers.Public sector employees working in essential services, including childcare or education, should continue to go into work.Where it is necessary for you to work in other people\u0027s homes - for example, for nannies, cleaners or tradespeople - you can do so. Otherwise, you should avoid meeting for work in a private home or garden, where COVID-19 Secure measures may not be in place.Employers and employees should discuss their working arrangements, and employers should take every possible step to facilitate their employees working from home, including providing suitable IT and equipment to enable remote working.The risk of transmission can be substantially reduced if COVID-19 secure guidelines are followed closely. Extra consideration should be given to those people at higher risk.Going to school, college and universityColleges, primary (reception onwards) and secondary schools will remain open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers. All other children will learn remotely until February half term.In the circumstances, we do not think it is possible for all exams in the summer to go ahead as planned. We will accordingly be working with Ofqual to consult rapidly to put in place alternative arrangements that will allow students to progress fairly.Public exams and vocational assessments scheduled to take place in January will go ahead as planned.UniversitiesThose students who are undertaking training and study for the following courses should return to face to face learning as planned and be tested twice, upon arrival or self-isolate for ten days:Medicine \u0026amp dentistrySubjects allied to medicinehealthVeterinary scienceEducation (initial teacher training)Social workCourses which require Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Body (PSRB) assessments and or mandatory activity which is scheduled for January and which cannot be rescheduled (your university will notify you if this applies to you).Students who do not study these courses should remain where they are wherever possible, and start their term online, as facilitated by their university until at least Mid-February. This includes students on other practical courses not on the list above.We have previously published guidance to universities and students on how students can return safely to higher education in the spring term. This guidance sets out how we will support higher education providers to enable students that need to return to do so as safely as possible following the winter break.If you live at university, you should not move back and forward between your permanent home and student home during term time.For those students who are eligible for face to face teaching, you can meet in groups of more than your household as part of your formal education or training, where necessary. Students should expect to follow the guidance and restrictions. You should socially distance from anyone you do not live with wherever possible.ChildcareThere are several ways that parents and carers can continue to access childcare:Early Years settings (including nurseries and childminders) remain openVulnerable children and children of critical workers can continue to use registered childcare, childminders and other childcare activities (including wraparound care)parents are able to form a childcare bubble with one other household for the purposes of informal childcare, where the child is under 14. This is mainly to enable parents to work, and must not be used to enable social contact between adultssome households will also be able to benefit from being in a support bubblenannies will be able to continue to provide services, including in the homeCare home visitsVisits to care homes can take place with arrangements such as substantial screens, visiting pods, or behind windows. Close-contact indoor visits are not allowed. No visits will be permitted in the event of an outbreak.You should check the guidance on visiting care homes during COVID-19 to find out how visits should be conducted. Residents cannot meet people indoors on a visit out (for example, to visit their relatives in the family home). There is separate guidance for those in supported living.Weddings, civil partnerships, religious services and funeralsWeddings, civil partnership ceremonies and funerals are allowed with strict limits on attendance, and must only take place in COVID-19 secure venues or in public outdoor spaces unless in exceptional circumstances.Funerals can be attended by a maximum of 30 people. Linked religious, belief-based or commemorative events, such as stone settings and ash scatterings can also continue with up to 6 people in attendance. Anyone working is not counted in these limits. Social distancing should be maintained between people who do not live together or share a support bubble.Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies must only take place with up to 6 people. Anyone working is not included. These should only take place in exceptional circumstances, for example, an urgent marriage where one of those getting married is seriously ill and not expected to recover, or is to undergo debilitating treatment or life-changing surgery.Places of worshipYou can attend places of worship for a service.

Weariness with the 20th-century novel’s puppet-show contrivances – to which Karl Ove Knausgaard’s My Struggle series was itself a response – has incited new interest in a hitherto marginal genre. Many are having a go at it, fewer are doing it well. Knausgaard’s new collection, which covers literature, contemporary art, photography, nature writing and loose cosmic musings, does not show him to be a first-rate practitioner of the form.In the Land of the Cyclops heightens the suspicion that Knausgaard fulfilled his authorial project with the completion of his six-part autofictional epic in 2011. Everything since then has had the feel of an addendum or miscellany – not least his 400-page collaborative book of emails about football, Home and Away. The Seasons Quartet, in which glum Knausgaard considered a different concept or object each day (Pain, Buttons, Labia), left the impression that his worldwide acclaim had, as we say in Ireland, given him notions. Indulged as a wide-eyed sanctifier of the commonplace, at times he resembled the laughable writer in Martin Amis’s novel The Information, who, beneficiary of sudden success, takes to gazing performatively at apples and stones, the better to project the childlike wonder befitting a literary sage.A lengthy review here of Michel Houellebecq’s novel Submission opens with a plodding explanation of why Knausgaard has never before read the author, and labours on under the presumption that we are as interested in the underqualified reviewer as we are in his subject. He’s better on Madame Bovary, and on much surer footing in a long essay on his compatriot Knut Hamsun’s “dirty modernism”. A piece about reading Kierkegaard in Beirut also begins with an admission that Knausgaard is a newcomer to the Danish philosopher (presumably a commissioning editor liked the symmetrical headline possibilities – Knausgaard on Kierkegaard). He has little to say on Kierkegaard’s thoughts that can’t easily be found elsewhere – and none of it is as lively as an excruciating anecdote about his reading a passage from My Struggle in which he slashes his face to impress a woman to a war-shocked Middle Eastern festival audience.It’s a reminder that My Struggle’s best episodes worked on the level of scandal and salaciousness – a several-thousand-page slab of Nordic reality TV in gossipy, oversharing prose. Knausgaard can be engaging on art and photography (subjects include Cindy Sherman, Anselm Kiefer, Francesca Woodman), but as a novelist turned philosopher-critic, he often reads as an Aristotelian particularist trying to be a universalising Plato. Whenever he looks up from the concrete, sensuous and personal, he drifts into watery abstraction. His essays are wide ranging in the sense that they tend to cover too much ground. One, Idiots of the Cosmos, skips between identity politics, War and Peace, Pascal’s horror of the infinite, the northern lights and much else besides, but none of it really sticks. With no recollected or imagined world (of childhood, adolescence, manhood) to earth his perceptions, his thoughts spool out, untethered and inconsequential. At his worst, Knausgaard the essayist is a monological bore.An exception is the pugnacious title piece. It reads like an allegory of cancel culture, until you realise he’s talking about Sweden. Knausgaard’s adopted home seems to be at the vanguard of punitive, curtain-twitching philistinism. With wary indignation he details how the national press have slandered him as a paedophile, a misogynist and a Nazi, and compared him to Anders Breivik. “So what was my crime? I wrote a novel.” He rehearses commonsensical positions that now require defending even beyond priggish Scandinavia: art should convey the messily actual and not just the ideal fictive description does not entail the act of condoning, and so on. Clearly, this stuff really rankles: in Home and Away he also tore into the intolerance and self-righteousness of Swedish liberals (it was the feminist youth leagues who were having a go at him in that instance).The Knausgaard diehard will appreciate the reminiscences of childhood journeys and youthful misadventures, even if some of these are recycled. He retells a prophetic dream that was central to Some Rain Must Fall, the darkly riveting fifth volume in My Struggle, as well as the shattering event the dream augured: a malicious false rape accusation. But here we discern the core weakness of In the Land of the Cyclops: the first time round, Knausgaard locked us inside the breathless first-person cockpit of his autofiction here, the dream and the horror it prophesied are bookends to lengthy, under-controlled and largely bloodless musings on literature, schizophrenia, Dante, Tycho Brahe and the Icelandic sagas. “I hate myself,” Knausgaard announces unbidden in a diaristic piece titled At the Bottom of the Universe.

In a new year update, the thinktank said the pandemic had thrown up challenges that could not be ducked.The IFS said: “We need to do more to ensure greater economic opportunities for minority ethnic groups, and ensure that they are not consigned to low-paid and self-employed occupations. They would benefit disproportionately from policies that, for example, provided greater security for the self-employed and others in insecure work, improved pay and conditions in health and social care, and supported progress through the labour market.”The report also said that without targeted support for children who had fallen behind as a result of the crisis, the “huge educational inequalities that existed” before the pandemic were almost certain to get worse.The IFS said the risk of permanent scarring to the younger generation would be reduced if help was provided to school leavers and graduates looking for work and training. Asset prices had been bolstered by Bank of England action to support the economy, making it important for the Treasury to support the young and those without wealth.Deaton said: “As the vaccines should, at some point this year, take us into a world largely free of the pandemic, it is imperative to think about policies that will be needed to repair the damage and that focus on those who have suffered the most. We need to build a country in which everyone feels that they belong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20df7633ca88105691aeef0effaf39b0583f868e/0_0_5512_3307/master/5512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39395936ff653570df26727b0e1ef1e0","title":"market rally ends as england scotland plunged fresh lockdown covid coronavirus stocks pound sterling business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news as England and Scotland enter tough Covid restrictionsThat’s because investors are focusing on its strong Christmas trading figures instead.

But supermarkets are upbeat as they report their Christmas trading figures.Morrisons said online sales had tripled and growth was boosted by strong demand for festive favourites such as champagne and salmon as families made the most of the quieter festivities.David Potts, the chief executive, said: The pandemic has had a severe effect on people and communities around Britain for nine months now but it has been especially hard at Christmas time.I’m very pleased with the way the Morrisons team has helped our customers across the nation enjoy their Christmas in the best way they could.It comes amid further uncertainty about when international travel and tourism will return to some kind of normal.

Here are the first prints from major indexes across Europe: CBI director general Tony Danker also told the BBC that he expects that the Treasury, and the business department “will come out in the next few days” with support for businesses. But it looks like today may be the day. Cabinet minister Michael Gover just told BBC Breakfast that Chancellor Rishi Sunak will make an announcement later on Tuesday. Stay tuned. The head of the CBI business lobby group, Tony Danker, says the government cannot wait until the March budget to roll out extra support for businesses impacted by fresh Covid restrictions:We’ve seen lockdowns before, we know the impact they have, and so I’m afraid more comprehensive restrictions do require a more comprehensive economic response.Speaking to the BBC’s Today programme, Danker said there were three urgent issues that the government needed to address in its emergency response for businesses. The first is restricted cash flow, which could be helped with further VAT deferrals, tax relief, and more generous government grants.And I think the third thing is underwriting support for the duration, so that firms stay the course rather than acting precipitously. I don’t think we can wait until the budget in March to review support. Business will take a view sooner, and so I think we need to respond very soon, and not wait for the budget.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.A surge in Covid cases and concerns that health services could be overwhelmed have prompted fresh national lockdown measures in Scotland and England. While England’s measures will become legally binding on Wednesday, the prime minister Boris Johnson has asked people to start following the restrictions from Tuesday night onwards. It means most businesses will close their doors, including all non-essential retailers, hair and nail salons, gyms and leisure centres. Pubs will also no longer be allowed to offer takeaway alcohol. UK business lobby groups are now calling for more government support, including further tax relief, VAT deferral, cash grants and an extension of the low-interest bounce back loan programme for small businesses.Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said this morning that the government will review the restrictions on 15 February, with hopes of progressively lifting restrictions after that.

It happened in 2002, when his unit was ambushed by poachers with AK-47 rifles and a shotgun. He was wounded in the arm and stomach one bullet rupturing his spleen. As a wildlife police officer in Zambia’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife, his job is inherently risky.Like other wildlife protectors, he puts his life on the line every day. But not every animal needing protection is a big beast. Following the incident in 2002 in a park bordering Angola, Mubiana was transferred to Kasanka national park in central Zambia, where he now protects one of nature’s mysteries – and the biggest mammal migration in the world – from poachers and land encroachment. These poachers may be after antelope and elephants, but their actions also pose a threat to the straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum.Every year, between October and December, 8–10 million straw-coloured fruit bats descend on the park to feast on an abundance of fruit. From west Africa, over the forests of the Congo basin and on to Zambia, the bats migrate thousands of kilometres over savanna and open land, dispersing seeds into deforested areas, and reforesting and regenerating landscapes on their journey. Scientists are still trying to fathom why these fruit bats, or “flying foxes”, gather at Kasanka in numbers not seen anywhere else. Each night they leave their evergreen swamp fig roosts to fly up to 55 miles (90km) in search of wild berries and fruit.Listed as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list, the straw-coloured fruit bat is one of the largest fruit bats in Africa. There are fears that if their numbers drop below a certain amount, the colony may not be able to keep going. “If that turns out to be true, we might be in trouble,” says Dr Dina Dechmann of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, whose team has studied the bats for 12 years.With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the bats have faced a new threat from humans seeking to attack them. “These bats are being persecuted because of ongoing publicity about their role as virus hosts. Their importance completely outweighs the potential threat,” says Dechmann, adding that their role in transmitting viruses such as Covid-19 directly to humans has not been scientifically proved.But habitat loss is fast becoming the park’s chief threat. As forests where bats roost and feed are lost, they are increasingly being forced out. “Bats will either need to forage farther, or they will remain in the same location and overuse resources. So it’s a habitat and wildlife management issue just as much as an urban-human bat conflict issue,” says Taylor-Boyd.Areas surrounding the park are also critical for people who rely on the forest for food and income. The trust has helped communities gain legal ownership of 60,000 hectares of surrounding forest, supporting income-generating activities such as beekeeping. Churchill Musungwa, a voluntary forest guard, says his community decided to work with the trust after seeing land nearby destroyed.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41e4a869cfb9ac2da06bff3ecab4d7e8014f7dc3/13_0_5383_3232/master/5383.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ebff3e7d5c911f871d94284f53c5922","title":"the nature of the narwhal the one that is good at curving itself to the sky","story":"‘The whole thing that is great about the teeth of the narwhal is that nothing makes sense’There are some animals about which it is easy to forget the fact that they have teeth, so that every time they flash their grins, it is as though you are seeing a new animal. Dogs, cats of all kinds, sharks and crocodiles are not among these. Horses, rabbits, fish and geese live toothless in my mind.Narwhals are among the actually toothless, if you discount their tusks. Inside their mouths, which are shaped in a permanently sweet smile, there are no teeth as we understand teeth to be. But the males have a long, unicorn-like projection protruding – just off centre – from what might be described as their upper lip. I find them quite festive, like ornaments that should be hung on a Christmas tree. Maybe it’s their wintry, icicle-like tusk. I try to forget that this tusk is a tooth.In Moby-Dick, Ishmael describes the narwhal as having: “A very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.” He describes the “peculiar horn”, because it is not in the middle, as “giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man.”Nobody knows for sure what the beautiful tusk is for.“It is striking when you think that this animal decided to take all of its tooth-producing energy and put it into one thing,” Martin Nweeia, a Harvard dentist told the Smithsonian, where he is a member of the Department of Vertebrate Zoology. “With the amount of energy that it takes to produce that one tusk it could easily have 30 to 40 teeth in its mouth doing other things.”“Tooth-producing energy” the idea of teeth “doing other things”. It is all quite a lot to chew on.In 2014, Nweeia developed a new theory: the tooth is sensitive, a bit like our teeth when we drink ice water. But because of its spiral shape, it seems to be designed to expose the narwhal tusk to the water, rather than protect them. Nweeia believes that the tusks can sense the salinity of water, which helps them to tell whether icebergs are melting, diluting the sea, or forming, which makes it more salty. This tells them whether they need to leave in order to avoid being trapped in the ice.The Inuit name for narwhals translates as “the one that is good at curving itself to the sky”, because narwhals often point their tusks up and out of the water (the word “narwhal” comes from the old Norse nár, which means corpse, because they sometimes lie very still, the verb for which is “logging”).When they are not pointing their faces to the sky or lazing about, they e to depths of more than a kilometre.In Moby-Dick, Herman Melville also wrote that the Danish king’s throne was made from narwhal tusks, which is true. The throne chair, as it is called, is guarded by three life-sized silver lions weighing 130kg each.In England, at William the Conqueror’s castle in Warwick, there is a narwhal tusk that is said to be the rib of the Dun Cow, the most British mythical beast that ever existed: it is a very large cow that roams the heath and once belonged to a giant.“The whole thing that is great about the teeth of the narwhal is that nothing makes sense,” said Nweeia in 2012. But vikings believed narwhal tusks, whatever their purpose for the narwhals, could cure melancholia. Thinking of these porpoises with their tails and tusks pointed cheerfully at the sky, how could you not agree?“The Nature of …” is a column by Helen Sullivan dedicated to interesting animals, insects, plants and natural phenomena.

Liverpool were beaten in the league for only the second time this season but Jürgen Klopp spent much of this captivating contest, settled by a nonchalant Danny Ings strike after 112 seconds, pacing the technical area and beyond with all of the self-restraint of Basil Fawlty.For Liverpool, the painful reality is they have now dropped more points in 17 matches this campaign than they did the whole of last season. It took until the 75th minute for the off-colour visitors to manage their sole shot on target, courtesy of Sadio Mané, but Southampton deservedly savoured victory. Victory moves them to sixth and four points now separate the top seven.At the final whistle Ralph Hasenhüttl collapsed to his knees and was visibly choked. “It is the first time I have taken points against Jürgen,” Hasenhüttl said. “I was joking with him one month or two months’ ago, at the manager’s meeting, saying: ‘Maybe once I could have a chance to take a point against you.’ It was a special performance and a perfect evening.”Had the Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson – one-half of an unorthodox centre-back pairing alongside Fabinho – not cleared off the line six minutes from time, the substitute Yan Valery would have spared Southampton a nail-biting finish. Stuart Armstrong and then Jan Bednarek flung their bodies at the ball in sacrifice and, until being withdrawn late on, Ings was typically selfless, throwing himself into a ing block on halfway as if the last man.Liverpool were aggrieved not to be awarded a penalty when Georginio Wijnaldum’s shot appeared to strike the arms of the Southampton defender Jack Stephens, but Klopp recognised his team served up another wishy-washy performance. They have not scored in their past two matches and are now winless in three after draws against West Brom and Newcastle. “We worry about that,” Klopp said. “We know about the situation. We are not silly.”Klopp’s admiration for Ings is well documented but perhaps the biggest compliment was the one that awaited him here in the form of the Liverpool manager’s lineup.The Liverpool teamsheet was in effect a game of Spot the Defender and, while it was an unusual centre-back pairing, Klopp pointed towards Henderson’s telepathic relationship with Fabinho, albeit “a few yards ahead” of the Liverpool back line, in his reasoning and also insisted he would take full responsibility if his captain was to be found wanting out of position.Klopp was happy to bear the brunt of any criticism for his selections, but not for a lukewarm performance. He went ballistic as Andy Robertson was booked and fumed after Liverpool fell behind with less than two minutes on the scoreboard.James Ward-Prowse dinked a free-kick behind Trent Alexander-Arnold, who was caught ball-watching, and Ings exquisitely lobbed Alisson from the angle. Thiago Alcântara was booked a minute later and Klopp raged. “Wake up,” he roared. If it wasn’t Klopp, it was Hasenhüttl neither manager required a megaphone to make their voices heard.Liverpool, in their camouflage mint green, were conspicuous by their absence in a frenetic first half in which they huffed and puffed, failing to test Fraser Forster. When the goalkeeper, making his first appearance at St Mary’s for more than three years, was eventually called into action, the assistant referee flagged Mohamed Salah offside. Salah headed over just before half-time after meeting Mané’s lofted cross but, in truth, Southampton should have headed down the tunnel with a greater advantage.Nathan Tella, a first-half substitute for the injured Moussa Djenepo, dipped a shot wide and Henderson had to be alert to snare the ball away after Ward-Prowse again brilliantly freed Ings. There were outstanding performances across the board, from Kyle Walker-Peters to Ibrahima Diallo.By the time the fourth official, Stuart Attwell, signalled for four minutes of first-half stoppage-time, Liverpool craved the whistle. “If you play like we did tonight, you play with fire,” Klopp said.Klopp waited until 10 minutes after the interval to tweak things, introducing Xherdan Shaqiri in place of the former Southampton midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, but made his feelings known at the break.Alexander-Arnold drove forward with purpose but his cross went unmet and soon after Wijnaldum powered at goal. His shot appeared to strike the arm of the Southampton defender Stephens but the video assistant referee, Andy Madley, saw it differently. Liverpool’s assistant manager Pepijn Lijnders decried it an “unbelievable” decision as Klopp remonstrated with Attwell.Stephens was fortunate but his block to deny another former Saint, Mané, moments later was magnificent. It was that kind of full-blooded gusto that embodied a gutsy Southampton display."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a4de37f37c7c9af4ed6daf6e7ca4d15d9c9d0ba/0_304_4199_2520/master/4199.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=538778a5576fc766c175121cdbc648d2","title":"frank lampard peaks and troughs no match for self belief chelsea manager","story":"The Chelsea manager is staying calm amid a slump but he must be proactive and not simply wait for hard work to pay offFrank Lampard’s autobiography is called Totally Frank. It was written in 2006 when the then Chelsea midfielder was 28, rendering it – at best – Partially Frank, Prematurely Frank, Avariciously Hasty Frank.Anyway, there is a passage in the book from the summer of 2005, when Lampard gets wind of a rumour that the winner of the club’s player of the year award gets invited on to Roman Abramovich’s yacht. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, Lampard tells himself. And so at one home game he musters the courage to ask the Chelsea owner if the rumour is true. Abramovich laughs hard. Lampard gulps. But eventually, his brazenness is rewarded.A few days later, the director Eugene Tenenbaum approaches Lampard at training and asks how many days he wants. “A week,” Lampard blurts out. Then he thinks: “‘Fuck it, I’ve got this far.’ … ‘I’ll have two weeks.’” Arrangements are made. Dates are fixed. Flights are booked.Lampard’s fortnight on the Abramovich yacht is recounted in lascivious, longing detail. (By contrast, the Champions League semi-final defeat against Liverpool a few weeks earlier is dispensed with in a few sentences.) He marvels at the luxurious trappings, the spacious bedrooms, the courteous staff who bring him unbidden platters of fruit. One evening the Formula One tycoon Eddie Jordan pulls up in his boat and casually invites Lampard and his girlfriend for dinner with Bono. “I’m not a huge music fan,” Lampard admits, which may explain why the pair get on so well.“It all seemed too good to be true,” Lampard writes. “Me? The lad who struggled to get into the West Ham team, now about to holiday on Sussurro, one of the most expensive private boats at sea? Are you sure? Not bad for a boy from Romford!”There are two quietly revealing aspects to how Lampard recounts the yacht story and how he rationalises much of his career to date. The first is the rags-to-riches ornamentation, the trope of the humble Essex boy done good: albeit one with a famous footballing father, private schooling and an elite academy background.The second is a steadfast belief in the ultimate economy of the universe, that what you put in equals what you get out (“nothing ventured, nothing gained”). Luck is something you make for yourself. Put the hours in, approach life with the right attitude and over time the arc of history will always bend towards justice, order and an all-expenses-paid holiday on a billionaire’s yacht.Paradoxically, this is a trait you glimpse most strongly in times of adversity. As Lampard’s Chelsea currently endure a mid-season slump, with four defeats in their past six games, it is worth examining the steps that brought them to this point. Early in the season Chelsea were a freewheeling, free-scoring attacking circus. Then in October Lampard moved to tighten up the defence, conceding two goals in nine games.Now, although results have taken a downturn, Lampard remains supremely calm. “I’m relaxed about peaks and troughs of form,” he said after Chelsea’s 3-1 home defeat against Manchester City on Sunday. Based on the underlying numbers, he has a point. Since the start of December, Chelsea’s expected goal difference is second only to City’s, though they have taken seven points from seven games. A tweak or two, a few days’ rest and before long the inherent rightness of the universe will reassert itself.The issue is that when you actually watch Chelsea, you realise they need more than a tweak. There was one attacking move in the second half on Sunday that epitomised this. Mason Mount darted into the left channel and rolled an inviting cross along the six-yard line. But Timo Werner had come short anticipating the cutback, Hakim Ziyech was lurking in his usual position near the corner of the box and so the cross proved harmless.Three inidual players, all doing what came most naturally to them. The result: a shambles. And the logical culmination of a model in which Chelsea have assembled some of the world’s greatest attacking talents without much of a clue of how they might fit together. They make nice runs. They do clever things. Often, it all clicks and everyone looks like a genius. But it does not feel like a sustainable formula and you wonder if a more restless and curious coach than Lampard would be more worried about it.Instead, his public-facing strategy seems to have been one of displacement, such as when he turned on his own players after losing against Arsenal. This, perhaps, is only to be expected. For much of his career Lampard played in strong, title-challenging teams where most weeks you do your jobs, and you win. If you don’t win, by extension, then someone didn’t do their job.Were he the sort of manager prone to introspection or self-analysis, this might be an appropriate moment for Lampard to reflect that the qualities that earned him the Chelsea job may not necessarily be those best suited to keeping it. After all, this is not a club, and Abramovich not an owner, that cares to endure peaks and troughs for very long.And yet, the overarching logic of Lampard’s life to date suggests the best course of action is simply to work hard, brazen things out and hope for the best. After all, it all seems too good to be true. Me? A rookie manager who struggled in vain to get Derby promoted, now managing one of the biggest clubs in the world, with some of the world’s most expensive attacking players? Not bad for a boy from Romford!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8a6ffb075dc49f67a2b1e80b1d70b03f352c0bd/375_395_1669_1002/master/1669.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e5ffc1f47b07d62811d93b47c55aedf0","title":"uk music festivals face cancellation without government support insurance coronavirus","story":"Industry calls for measures including insurance scheme similar to one for TV and filmSummer music festivals face cancellation unless the government steps in to provide support, the British music industry has warned.The call for action came as Emily Eavis, who co-organises Glastonbury festival with her father, Michael, turned to social media to deny that this year’s event has been cancelled. “There’s no news this end yet, we haven’t cancelled,” she tweeted on Monday after the Spice Girls singer Mel B said Glastonbury was not happening this June.Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, Mel B said: “I know that Glastonbury has been cancelled so a lot of big stage performances are on hold again this year. It’s sad, but we’ve got to get this virus under control.”However, UK Music, the umbrella organisation representing the commercial music industry, said the government needed to act fast to support the live music industry – including guaranteeing cancellation insurance – or festivals would have to be cancelled.“Government is rolling out the vaccine and is openly speculating about returning to normal by the spring,” said Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, the chief executive of UK Music. “But there is a serious risk that even if this proves to be a reality, lack of notice and available insurance options will mean much of the 2021 summer music season can’t go ahead.

There will need to be a concerted effort from industry and the government together.”UK Music’s plan, which is detailed in a report entitled Let the Music Play: Save Our Summer, highlights six key actions the government must take to support the industry.The most important is a government-backed indemnity scheme that operates as a form of Covid insurance by providing financial support if festivals are affected by coronavirus, similar to a scheme that has kept film and TV production rolling in the UK. Last month, Germany announced a €2.5bn (£2.3bn) event cancellation fund.In addition, UK Music is asking for an “indicative” date for when venues and events can move back to full capacity, and an extension to a VAT rate reduction on tickets and business rates relief. In November, it said tens of thousands out of the almost 200,000 people who worked in the industry were at risk of losing their jobs.In June, Michael Eavis, said Glastonbury festival could go bankrupt if it had to be cancelled again this year. Last month, Emily Eavis said Glastonbury lost “millions” in 2020, adding: “We’re still quite a long way from being able to say we’re confident 2021 will go ahead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a36e29c46f268828a2732cf3e6474bc2c586a8/0_340_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80c6fdf0f8965e8cd70d3524f8fce50c","title":"burning the furniture my life as a consumer","story":"Some thoughts on buying a house, white privilege and homewares for the apocalypseWhat does it say about capitalism, John asks, that we have money and want to spend it but we can’t find anything worth buying? We’re on our way home from a furniture store, again. We almost bought something called a credenza, but then John opened the drawers and discovered that it wasn’t made to last.I think there are limits, I say, to what mass production can produce.We just bought a house but we don’t have furniture yet. We’ve been eating on our back stoop for three months. Last week a Mexican woman with four children rang our doorbell and asked if our front room was for rent. I’m sorry, I said awkwardly, we live here. She was confused. But, she said, it’s empty.It is empty. I hang curtains to hide the emptiness, but it remains empty. There wasn’t any furniture in the house where I grew up until a German cabinetmaker moved in with us. He arrived in a truck so heavy that it made a dent in the driveway. He filled our dining room with his furniture, and then he made tiny replicas of that furniture with the machines he brought in the truck. I still have the tiny corner cabinet with lattice doors, the tiny hutch with brass knobs and the tiny dining room table with expertly turned legs. They’re in the basement, wrapped in newspaper. The tiny dresser sits atop my dresser, which is from Ikea.The apartment we just left was furnished with shelves that John made out of cheap pine. They’re in the basement now, reduced to lumber. The ammunition box that I found on the kerb and made into a coffee table is in the back yard, planted full of marigolds. I hate furniture, my father once murmured. He had just visited a warehouse full of furniture made of unfinished pine. This was after the cabinetmaker went to a nursing home and his furniture went away, too. As a child, I burned a hole in the dining room table. The cabinetmaker, who smoked a pipe, supplied me with matches. I loved to burn things, but I felt remorse over the table, which I also loved.The lyric “I burned a hole in the dining room table” is tethered, in my mind, to the liner notes of a Billie Holiday album that I borrowed from the library in college. She was singing songs written by someone else, the notes explained, but she rewrote them with the way she sang. Her delivery transformed a banal portrait of moneyed life into a wry critique of that moneyed life.In the furniture stores we visit, I’m filled with a strange unspecific desire. I want everything and nothing. The soft colours of the rugs, the warm wood grains, the brass and glass of the lamps all seem to suggest that the stores are filled with beautiful things, but when I look at any one thing I don’t find it beautiful. “The desire to consume is a kind of lust,” Lewis Hyde wrote. “But consumer goods merely bait this lust, they do not satisfy it. The consumer of commodities is invited to a meal without passion, a consumption that leads to neither satiation nor fire.”In the end, all the furniture we buy will feel like lyrics written for someone else’s song, except the dining room table made by the Amish. This table will be solid cherry, a beautiful wood. It will be well made, but not quite as well made as the table I grew up with, the table I burned. To get a table like that, we would need to spend much more money. Or we would need a German cabinetmaker to move in with us.“I once had a girl  Or I should say, she once had me,” the car radio sings. John and I both fall silent. It’s been a long time since I’ve heard this song. And I don’t know if I’ve ever really listened to the ending. What happened there, I wonder. Did he make a fire in the fireplace while the girl was at work? No, John tells me, he burned her place down. He is sure of this, but I am not so sure.I can’t stop thinking about it. Norwegian Wood. It bothers me. Soon I’m reading interviews with the Beatles. “It was pine really, cheap pine,” McCartney said about the wood panelling that inspired the title. About the ending, he said: “It could have meant I lit a fire to keep myself warm, and wasn’t the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn’t, it meant I burned the fucking place down.”Our house is a brick bungalow, nearly identical to the house next door. These houses were built by brothers, both dead now. I learn this from my neighbour, who lives in the other brother’s house. He’s a retired postal worker and a saxophone player who still practises every day, though his health is now too poor for him to perform. The interiors of our houses are the same, he tells me, except for my attic, which the former owners of our house renovated. He would like to renovate his attic, too, but he doesn’t have the money. Some relatives of his are in prison and all his extra money goes to supporting their families. I guess God, he says, doesn’t want me to have money. I’m not sure, but I think he’s joking about God.He has told me, already, about attending the same elementary school my son attends, and of being beaten up in the playground.He has told me that he couldn’t, in those days, risk a conversation with a woman like me. He had to keep his head down when he passed a white woman on the sidewalk, he said, and just respond Yes, ma’am if she spoke to him. He has told me, also, of refusing a holiday turkey offered to him by the owner of a mansion by the lake, a rich man who demanded that he wade through deep snow to deliver packages to the service entrance at the back of the house.The former owners of our house, who were white, made extra money by allowing the house to be used as a set for commercials. John discovers this when he gets a call from a casting director who wants to know if the house is available. It’s not available – we live here. But then we learn how much we will be paid. All we have to do is leave the house for three days and two nights and we will earn $8,000.The commercial is going to be for Walmart, the corporation that produced the fortunes of three of the 20 richest people in this country. Walmart couldn’t build stores in Chicago for years but they’re here now, despite ongoing protests over low wages, and they want their commercial set in a classic Chicago bungalow. We don’t own anything from Walmart, but this doesn’t matter because Walmart furniture is moved into the house, Walmart curtains are put up, and some Walmart prints are hung on the walls in Walmart frames. A white set designer and a white director work to create an authentic African American interior. The commercial, they tell us, is going to feature an African American grandmother serving a holiday turkey.Next door, in the house just like ours, lives an actual African American grandmother, the wife of the retired postal worker.We’re getting paid to have our house made over to look like what a set designer imagines their house looks like so that Walmart can try to sell things to people who look like them.John tells all this to his friend Dan, who says, I think that’s the definition of white privilege. I don’t understand, my mother says. How is that the definition of white privilege? This isn’t the first punchline she’s ruined. My mother dropped out of high school and later, after college and a orce, she nearly dropped out of the middle class. She still has white privilege, but she often does not have hot water.I admire how thoroughly she has discarded the life she was born into, the silver in the sideboard and the opera on the record player. She has kept only the books.In one of the fairy tales she told me as a child, a girl is pursued by a witch. As the girl runs, she throws behind her the things she carries in her pockets, the things her mother has given her. She throws down a hairbrush that becomes a thick forest. She throws down a hand mirror that becomes a lake between her and the witch. You must throw away everything you’ve been given, my mother might say. That much I understand. But it has only just occurred to me to wonder what witch she’s running from. And if her witch will be my witch, too.She used to trade eggs from her chickens to a neighbour for expired bread, still good. And when she drove us home from school she would stop at a dumpster behind a restaurant to salvage fruit, also still good. I once asked my mother if she had a retirement account and she laughed at me. I’ve never had anything like that, she said. And then she said, after a pause, My children are my retirement account. You were my investment.She had four children by the time she was 30, but she had no income, no contributions to social security. I was without children at thirty and already working for the university. I have a retirement account, which puts me in a poor position to explain privilege to my mother. Nobody understands privilege as well as those who don’t have it. I guess, I tell her, I don’t understand, either.I’m taking possession of the house by painting it, every room. And the question of what colour in what room is consuming me. I think maybe I should start with historical colours, but I can see the original colour of the walls under the layers of chipped paint: cloying pink. Maybe memory, not history, is the place to start. Buttered Yam, from my mother’s garden. Evening Blue, an old bottle half-buried in the dirt. Forest Moss, the colour of my mother’s little living room, which smelled like woodsmoke.Color(ed) Theory Suite, a work in which artist Amanda Williams painted houses slated for demolition on the South Side of Chicago, began as a collection of colours: Harold’s Chicken Shack Red, Crown Royal Purple, Pink Oil, Ultrasheen Blue, Flamin’ Hot Orange, Currency Exchange Yellow. “This palette combined my Ivy League academic training as an architect with my lived sensibility as a South Side native,” she says. Each house was painted a single colour, from the bricks of the foundation to the shingles on the roof. She painted only houses that weren’t worth anything to anyone – not to dealers, not to squatters, not to neighbourhood teenagers. “Zero-value” was her term. And she painted these zero-value properties in colours drawn from products sold to black people. Every colour, she says, is a code.I’m having trouble finding the right white. I don’t like Opulence White or Chantilly Lace or French Manicure. This conversation is boring, my sister complains. Maybe I’ll give up on white, I tell her, and paint the living room peach. Peach is problematic, she says, laughing at me now.I’ve discovered a brand of paint that I can’t afford. But I could buy it. To afford something like paint, for someone of my class, is to announce your values, most often, not your financial capacity. I can’t admit to valuing paint that costs $110 a gallon. But I find this paint unbearably luminous, and undeniably better than any other paint. At night, when my family is asleep, I study paint swatches from the hardware store and then I open the heavy folds of the catalogue from Farrow \u0026amp Ball and run my fingers over the small squares of paint, slightly raised in estate emulsion. Even the names are better: Matchstick, String, Cord, Skimming Stone. These are not aspirational whites – these whites can afford to be modest. One is even called Blackened.I remember the great revelation of moving up from acrylic paints in high school to oil paints in college. First just black and white on paper, and then a full set on canvas. They were worth the expense, those silken oils in their slim metal tubes. I loved all the colours, especially the cadmium orange, which was slightly toxic. Flamin’ hot. This is the closest I’ve come to painting in years, shopping for paint.I send a swatch of Sulking Room Pink to Robyn, knowing she’ll appreciate the name. “To sulk” in French is bouder, the source of boudoir, a woman’s private room. A room of one’s own, in a dusty, moneyed pink. And then there’s Etiquette, a white described as “a well-mannered hue”. It’s a white that’s hiding behind its own whiteness. Another line for this white poem. My mind is on paint now more often than poetry. I’ve found a new literature: Crisp Linen, Collector’s Item, White Zinfandel, Pashmina, Fine China, Ivory Tower, Mirage White, American White.The paint company Benjamin Moore has declared Simply White the Colour of the Year. This, in 2016, the year a white man will be elected to the White House. The selection of white as the Colour of the Year was “inevitable,” the creative director of Benjamin Moore says. “The colour white is transcendent, powerful, and polarising – it is either taken for granted or obsessed over.”I obsess, which solves nothing. Deep in Thought is my favourite name for a white, but I don’t really like the colour. I wouldn’t want my walls Deep in Thought. On my way to a parent-teacher conference I stop in the hallway of the elementary school to photograph a huge box of institutional toilet paper, the colour listed on the label as Empathy White. Maybe that’s the colour I’m looking for. Or a variant, a concerned off-white like All Apologies. Or something more revealing, like Paperwork White or Payroll White. Or maybe I should just paint it all Property.The catalogues keep coming. I don’t know how they find us, or how to make them stop. Sometimes, two of the same catalogue arrive on the same day. They accumulate in piles, outdoing each other with heavier paper and richer colours. Then the Restoration Hardware catalogue arrives, like a parody of the whole problem, in two volumes, each the size of a telephone book. These are bigger and heavier than my grandfather’s two-volume set of Illustrated English Social History. We put the Restoration Hardware catalogues near the fireplace and sit on them.The Ikea catalogue has a message on the front: “Designed for people, not consumers.” In the photograph, some young people are having a fun, unfussy dinner at a crowded table. There are dirty dishes piled on a cart and a guitar is leaning against the wall. The Ikea catalogue sits on top of a pile of catalogues with photographs of sterile rooms showcasing furniture that has never been touched. This other, messier way of life, Ikea suggests, is not just less expensive, it is more human.John and I have a set of two dressers from Ikea, and Nick and Robyn have the same two dressers. Nick’s is his second of this dresser – the bottoms dropped out of all the drawers in the first one. It was like a building with a perfect facade, Robyn said, where all the floors had collapsed into the basement. I remember a brownstone in New York City like that, with trees growing inside. And a foreclosure in the suburbs still pristine on the outside, but stripped of all its fixtures inside, even the wires and the pipes.The dresser is simple and Shaker in its design. Shakers believed that the end of the world was near, which would seem to be an argument for temporary furniture, but making something built to last was, for them, an act of prayer. “Do all your work as if you had 1,000 years to live,” Mother Ann Lee told her brethren, “and as you would if you knew you must die tomorrow.”There aren’t many Shakers left. Their furniture has outlasted them, as it was meant to. Their values, I was told by a tour guide at the village where Ann Lee died, which I visited as a school child, were embodied in their furniture. I wonder if a Shaker dresser, taken out of the context of Shaker life, still embodies the Shaker dedication to celibacy and hard work. Perhaps it whispers to its owner at night. Maybe my dresser is where my doubts come from.In that village, I saw Shaker chairs hung on pegs and I was taught to sing a Shaker song. The furniture didn’t interest me, but I was captivated by the song, especially the last two lines: “To turn, turn, will be our delight  Till by turning, turning, we come round right.”In my 20s I moved 10 times. On the fourth or fifth move, when I was leaving New York, I left behind a bed frame that my mother had made. It was simple and spare with no headboard – Shaker almost – and designed for celibacy in that it was narrower than a single bed. My mother was upset when she learned that I had abandoned it. I tried to explain that I wasn’t leading a life that allowed for furniture.In California, I slept on a slab of foam that could easily be rolled up and moved anywhere. My boyfriend, who kept his clothes in a large cardboard box, suggested that we make all our furniture out of cardboard boxes. It was an idea that had already been pioneered by Ikea, who made chipboard end tables with hollow interiors. “The ease of self-invention that Ikea enables is liberating,” Lauren Collins wrote, “but it can be sad to be able to make a life, or dispose of it, so cheaply.” Within a year, I had rolled up my mattress and moved my boxes to Iowa, where I found my furniture on the street.“A better everyday life for the many people” is Ikea’s mission, on paper. I think of all the Ikea furniture that I have seen eaten by life. The end tables with broken legs, the cracked slats of futon frames, the chipboard desks left out on the kerb and destroyed by the rain before they can be taken to a new home. Ikea, one of the largest consumers of wood in the world, has made furniture into something that gets used up. It is furniture for the apocalypse. But what I like – what makes me laugh a little about “for people, not consumers” – is the implication that consumers are not people.‘A metaphor is all this really is,” David Graeber wrote. He means consumption, which was once the name for a wasting disease, and is now the word anthropologists use for almost everything we do outside of work – eating, shopping, reading, listening to music. Consume, he notes, is from the Latin consumere, meaning “to seize or take over completely”. A person might consume food or be consumed by rage. In its earliest usage, consumption always implied destruction.Consumption was the opposite of production in Adam Smith’s Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. He made this inquiry in 1776, when work was being relocated into factories and lives were newly ided between home and work. We still use the maths of that time to subtract what is consumed at home from what is produced at work. In that crude equation, only work that earns money is productive.And as long as there’s no third quantity, like reproduction, the equation works out to zero.She ate it, my father told my sister years ago, when she wondered what happened to my stereo. This was during my first year in New York, and the money for the stereo was a gift from my father, who had told me that he would pay for my college tuition and nothing else, ever. He had three more children to send to college. The stereo was an exception, a surprise for my birthday, and I did eat it. I wanted a stereo but I needed food.Food is destroyed by our consumption, but silverware is not, though the metaphor behind the word suggests that we eat up even our own silverware and dishes, too. “We should think about how far we want to extend the metaphor,” Graeber warned. Yes, we consume fossil fuels, in the “eat up, devour, waste, spend” sense of the word. But we don’t consume music.Music becomes part of us, as food does, but it isn’t destroyed in the process.What is destroyed when we think of ourselves as consumers, Graeber suggested, is the possibility that we might be doing something productive outside of work. • This is an edited extract from Having and Being Had by Eula Biss, published by Faber \u0026amp Faber and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, sign up to the long read weekly email here, and find our podcasts here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4608e0462b20002432926f3d090b46882ce28c9/0_2_6048_3627/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa47d7879695a5d8544bb51ba605e4fe","title":"how greenhouse gases are actually cooling earths upper atmosphere","story":"At high altitudes, carbon dioxide releases energy into space, making the atmosphere contractIn all the discussions about climate change, one thing is often overlooked – the upper atmosphere of Earth is actually cooling while the lower atmosphere grows warmer, and this strange paradox is a clear fingerprint of greenhouse gases at work.Carbon dioxide in the lower atmosphere helps trap heat from the sun’s solar energy reflected off the Earth’s surface and so, like a greenhouse, the lower atmosphere grows warmer. But at high altitudes it is a different story, because the upper atmosphere is so thin that the carbon dioxide releases its energy into space and so the upper atmosphere cools. And that cooling is also making the upper atmosphere contract.Past studies have shown that the cooling trend is driven by greenhouse gases, as well as shifts in the Earth’s magnetic field and the roughly 11-year cycle in the sun’s solar activity. A recent study disentangled these different factors by simulating the upper atmosphere at 100-500km altitude from 1950 to 2015. The results confirmed that rising carbon dioxide levels were the main driving force cooling the upper atmosphere. Shifts in the Earth’s magnetic field and variations in the solar cycle played much smaller roles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/627a7ae7cf3e229bcd01f53ad25ca7700df2329f/0_0_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=936c017d55c77a3fbdf42349e3ef4b1c","title":"today in focus revisited the clitoris coverup why do we know so little podcast","story":"Medical textbooks are full of anatomical pictures of the penis, but the clitoris barely rates a mention and many medical professionals are uncomfortable even talking about it.

To my mind, it’s the only way of getting back to normal life.”Pinker, who is a dialysis patient from Oxford, said he was only told on Saturday that he would be getting the jab on Monday.The government hailed the first injection outside clinical trials of the Oxford vaccine as a “pivotal moment” in the fight against the virus, but senior medics cautioned against over-optimism amid continuing alarm about record new cases.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “This is a pivotal moment in our fight against this awful virus and I hope it provides renewed hope to everybody that the end of this pandemic is in sight.”The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, urged the public not to get carried away. He tweeted: “Vaccines give us a route out in the medium term. The NHS is, however, under very considerable and rising pressure in the short term. We must all follow social distancing for now.”Prof Andrew Pollard, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group who was among others who also received the shot on Monday morning, echoed this caution. “It gives us a bit of hope, but I think we’ve got some tough weeks ahead,” he said.He said that with record daily case numbers, the next few weeks would be a challenge despite the optimism provided by the distribution of Oxford’s vaccine.“This is a really critical moment. We are at the point of being overwhelmed by this disease,” he said.Boris Johnson, who watched health workers get the vaccine at London’s Royal Free hospital on Monday, has promised that tens of millions of people will be vaccinated by spring. Hancock admitted that only 530,000 doses of the vaccine were ready for use this week, but promised the distribution programme was being accelerated.Speaking to the BBC, he said: “It’s a matter of getting the vaccine as soon as it’s manufactured, and then goes through the crucial safety checks, which obviously are very important and getting it into the NHS and delivered into people’s arms.”Sam Foster, Churchill hospital’s chief nurse, who administered the first Oxford vaccine, said: “It was a huge privilege. There’s nothing more that the NHS wants to do now is to get this programme going at real scale across the NHS.”NHS England’s medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said: “The NHS’s biggest vaccination programme in history is off to a strong start, thanks to the tremendous efforts of NHS staff who have already delivered more than one million jabs.“Throughout the pandemic their response has been phenomenal, from introducing world-leading treatments for coronavirus, which have saved patients’ lives as well as delivering the very first Covid-19 vaccines outside of a trial in a landmark moment in history, and now rolling out the new OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, chalking up another world first that will protect thousands more over the coming weeks.”Oxford University denied that Pollard, who is 55, had jumped the queue in getting the vaccine of the first day. It said: “In line with the JCVI’s priority list, any member of the Oxford University vaccine trials team who are frontline healthcare workers, will be eligible for vaccination. Prof Pollard had been waiting to receive a vaccination in line with this policy.”Pollard said: “It was an incredibly proud moment for me to have received the actual vaccine that the University of Oxford and the AstraZeneca teams have worked so hard to make available to the UK and the world.“As a paediatrician specialising in infections, I know how important it is that healthcare workers along with other priority groups are protected as soon as possible – a crucial role in defeating this terrible disease.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bb8de9238fa1eb216518cc4afdbff7aa8c8a6b4/0_371_7287_4372/master/7287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cae5f836848b6f0d3d6bb0ba461fe607","title":"unease among doctors as follow up doses of uk covid jab delayed","story":"Survey finds medics have concerns about scrapping of second appointmentsDoctors are having their second dose of the Covid vaccine delayed, amid concern from medical organisations about the policy to widen the gap between injections and the threat to medics and their patients if they are not fully protected.A survey of doctors across the UK by the campaign group Everydoctor found that medics in many places who had had their first dose of a Covid vaccine had since had their appointments for the second dose cancelled.The government announced last Wednesday that it was shifting its vaccination policy to delay the period between administering the two doses from the recommended three to four weeks to 12 weeks, as it made frontline health and care staff a key priority group for vaccination.The change aims to give as many people as possible some immunity from one jab as soon as possible, rather than half that number maximum immunity with two.However, doctors’ organisations and patients have voiced unease about the strategy, which has led to many hundreds of thousands of people having their booked second appointments scrapped.While there is evidence from trials of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, circulation of which began on Monday, of greater efficacy among people who were given the second shot later, PfizerBioNTech have said there is no evidence for the efficacy of a single shot of their vaccine beyond three weeks. Dr Julia Patterson, the lead for Everydoctor, said doctors fear that delaying the second dose they need to obtain full immunity could lead to them becoming ill or infecting colleagues or patients.“The Covid-19 crisis is escalating and we need to urgently protect those who are working on the frontline. If healthcare workers are left unprotected, they are at risk themselves, and they may also pass coronavirus on to vulnerable patients,” said Patterson.“We were pleased to see last week that healthcare staff would now be vaccinated as a priority. However, five days on, many staff members are still in the dark about when they will receive vaccines.” Hospitals should now lay on clinics to immunise as many staff as fast as supplies of both vaccines allow, she added.Karoline Lamb, 84, said she was “absolutely fuming” that she might not be able to get the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine: “I was so elated when I had the first one. I had no side-effects and I’m booked in for the second one on 21 January, but I’m extremely worried it will be cancelled.”Lamb, from Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire, is concerned that the first dose risks “becoming ineffective”. “If I don’t get the second one within three weeks, I’m worried the first dose could do more harm than good. Had I known the government might not let me have the second dose in time, I would not have accepted the first one.”Meanwhile, close to 3.5m doses of the Oxford vaccine are awaiting release after undergoing checks by medical regulators, the  understands, amid calls for the rollout of the jab to be accelerated in what Labour has described as “a race against time”.The government has said that it already has a batch of 530,000 doses to be administered this week and Sir John Bell, Oxford University’s regius professor of medicine, had said a further 450,000 were due to be available at the start of the week. Several million more doses of the vaccine are understood to have been manufactured in the UK but are yet to be bottled in vials.The NHS will need to start delivering at least 2m jabs a week from next week if it is to fulfil the Boris Johnson’s plan to vaccinate everyone in the four highest-priority groups by mid-February. The four groups the prime minister said will have a first dose amount to 13.9 million people in England, according to Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister.Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, said on 30 December that his company would be able to provide 2m doses a week. But Matt Hancock, the health secretary, appeared to play down the possibility of reaching that level when the figure was put to him on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday. Hancock said: “John Bell is a great man, but he is not responsible for AstraZeneca’s manufacturing facility.”Labour’s shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, said: “Ministers should be going hell for leather to get 2m jabs a week distributed as soon as possible and then scale up further. We know this virus can mutate and could well do so again. We are in a race against time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edcfa74037b0d0f767a213f22edc7f642634c52d/0_150_4492_2695/master/4492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d068ad77acec6ae8f923a240ea19533e","title":"european chiefs consider altering covid tests to save competitions","story":"European rugby chiefs are investigating how testing procedures might be altered to prevent Covid-19 causing more disruption to the Champions and Challenge Cup group phases this month. Some French clubs had threatened to boycott the rest of the competition but, for now, organisers are still hoping next week’s round of fixtures will proceed as scheduled.The French clubs have been asking for testing rules to be standardised across the European leagues following recent cancellations on both sides of the Channel. The Top 14 sides are used to their players being tested 72 hours before games, with three or more positive tests for a club leading to the match being called off. A different system is in place in England where Premiership club players are routinely tested on Mondays and contact tracing is more prevalent.With infection rates rising again across Europe, a meeting of the EPCR Medical Advisory Group, comprising medical representatives of its shareholder leagues and unions, broke up without reaching a final resolution on Monday but it is understood that British players may well end up being tested closer to match day.Contact tracing, matchday risk assessment, cross-border travel and protocol compliance were also discussed, with independent input from a Swiss-based physician and virologist, Dr Daniel Koch. Despite reports in France that Bayonne have withdrawn from their remaining two Challenge Cup pool games against Leicester and Zebre, EPCR insists it has received no official word from any participating club that it does not intend to fulfil its remaining fixtures.The bigger picture remains a concern, however, with tighter lockdown restrictions now being put in place across Europe. If cross-border travel, even for professional athletes, becomes trickier it will make life even tougher for the organisers, with no room available within a packed calendar to reschedule the final two rounds of the preliminary stages.Further widespread group stage cancellations would clearly threaten the integrity of the entire tournament, with defending champions Exeter already struggling to qualify for the knockout phase after a raft of positive tests forced the cancellation of their game in Toulouse before Christmas.There are also growing calls for Premiership Rugby to scrap relegation this season on the grounds the bottom end of the table might be unfairly skewed by points awarded for unplayed games. A PRL spokesman insisted there had been “no votes taken or any decisions made” and said the outlook remained unclear: “It is a very difficult situation and people aren’t in control at the moment. The virus is in control and will dictate what happens”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1fd5e424295699de3fcbf3e5de6e8727b658152/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a6b517ea1474cda52190f7efd4c7e8d4","title":"elon musk new tesla gigafactory germany","story":"The Tesla project will put Grünheide on the map, but some say it is doing ‘irreversible’ harm to the environmentFor the past 10 months, Silas Heineken has been flying a drone over one of Germany’s biggest building sites and posting the images on YouTube.The 14-year-old self-named “Tesla Kid” has built a significant following, as tens of thousands tune in each week to see the latest developments in Elon Musk’s GigaFactory as it emerges at speed from the sandy ground of Brandenburg, south-east of Berlin.“He is a huge visionary who has great ideas, which he has managed to realise,” Heineken said in an interview.Having hung out on his bicycle to see Musk when he recently visited, the schoolboy sees an electric car factory close to his home in the sleepy town of Grünheide as a huge opportunity for the region.It is by far the biggest industrial settlement in the area in a century and Brandenburg’s economics minister, Jörg Steinbach, has called it a chance for the region “to become a leading energy revolution location in Germany and Europe”. Musk has promised to create 10,000 jobs and turn out about 500,000 cars a year, starting with its Model Y, and construct the world’s largest battery plant at the site. His vision will put the region on the map.Politicians talk off the record of their debt towards Musk, who they say could have easily gone to Asia instead, where labour costs are lower and environmental controls and construction standards less stringent.But while landowners are among those rubbing their hands with glee, having seen land prices increase tenfold since Musk made public his intentions in November 2019, there are many opponents. Most of them say they like the bosky backwater of Grünheide precisely because it is not on the map, and are horrified when they see – particularly on Heineken’s videos, depicting the emergence of the foundry, the pressing plant, the paint shop and the assembly plant – the speed at which the project is coming along, and the extent of the woodland it has already swallowed up.“Grünheide is just a small place of 9,000 souls, bordering a conservation area. Musk’s plans will turn it into a town of 40,000 – it will become like Wolfsburg,” says Werner Klink, referring to the city west of Berlin purpose-built in the 1930s around the production of the VW motorcar.Klink is a member of the Grünheide’s citizens’ initiative, a group of locals who are campaigning to stop the project. Construction projects in Germany, he says, usually take time “due to all the permits you need and regulations you must abide by before you even put a shovel in the ground”. Musk has instead chosen the very un-German route of starting the work first and then securing the permits.“Even if they told him he would not be allowed to continue, he will have already caused so much damage there’s no way he can take the site back to its original state,” Klink argues. “Immense, irreversible harm has been done to the nature, potentially to the groundwater, to the forest, the flora, fauna.”One hundred hectares of pine trees (the equivalent of approximately 26 football fields) have already been felled, and a further 86 hectares are likely to follow, after a court ruling last month.The barriers to Tesla come in the form of the sand lizard and European smooth snake, species that live in the woodland, Germany’s Nature Protection Union (NABU) has pointed out, and are at the heart of the legal battle to stop the project.There is also the matter of an outstanding downpayment to the local environment agency of €100m to cover possible remediation costs, which a court also ruled on 18 December was reason to halt the project. Lawyers for Tesla have filed to extend the deadline for payment, the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel has reported.Despite 360 objections to the project having been lodged, authorities have effectively allowed it to go ahead by telling Musk he does so at his own risk. The practice is not so unusual in Germany, though on this scale it is unprecedented.“Musk is a risk-taker, that’s what he does, and he’s banked on the fact they’ll never tell him to demolish his building, particularly when so many jobs are at stake,” says Klink, a retired geophysicist.He says the speed with which the site has sprung up has left no time to properly inspect the site. “There’s a considerable danger that the digging will contaminate the groundwater. Just one metre below the surface there is salt water and there are signs it’s rising. If it mixes with the fresh water we’ll have a huge problem on our hands.”A protest in December in front of Axel Springer House in Berlin over the German publisher’s tribute to Musk’s “ambition to make the world a better place” with its eponymous award drew climate activists and environmentalists, including NABU, the Society for Species Protection and the Grüne Liga (green league).Norbert Heß, the Brandenburg spokesman of the Ecological Democrats (ÖDP), a small political party, has accused the larger Green party of “violating their oath of office” by helping to accelerate the project.Heß says many aspects of the project have been poorly thought through. Why was consideration not given to the brown coal mining area of Lausitz in the south of Brandenburg, looking for a new raison d’etre after Germany’s planned brown coal phase-out, he asks. “The land where the opencast mines are is already stripped of nature,” Heß says.The Greens, in government in Brandenburg, say they welcome the project because it offers a viable alternative to the diesel motor, as well as creating much-needed local jobs. Tesla shies away from talking to the media. It has tried to express that it is well-intentioned in the form of projects such as pledging to plant three times as many trees as it fells, and building fences to protect the lizards and snakes.It also set up an information kiosk in the town, but that has been sparsely staffed. The coronavirus has reduced communication further.Most statements come in the form of succinct tweets from Musk himself, such as one in the run-up to Christmas, which simply said: “Thank you Brandenburg and Grünheide” after the mayor doubled his commitment to the project by signing off plans to create a transport system around the plant, which is also to include a park-and-ride facility to transfer workers to and from the factory.Klink said he has not yet met Musk, who occasionally turns up to see the progress of his project.“I don’t have any need or desire to meet him,” he said. But he does have a nickname for the Musk sycophants and flunkeys: “‘SchließMuskelkriecher’, a play on Musk’s name, mixed with the German both for sphincter and brown-noser. “At least that’s how our initiative sees it, even if I admit it’s rather rude,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c591bbea37e7352d23de9c4958ecdf94e0e3402/0_113_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4f058550e127a7c9f83986307158158","title":"take time off and move office functions online 10 ways to win at the new way of working","story":"The global pandemic has transformed work in a way many employees and executives want to maintain. So what can managers do today to ensure these different working practices remain a success in future?As each day passes, we’re constantly adjusting to the realities of our “new normal”. And in the unsettled world of work, worries about health and safety are compounded by other anxieties – with companies concerned about employee wellbeing, workplace services, and business continuity. Indeed, the need for organisations to continue operating has been one of the few constants of 2020.The good news is that new practices have evolved to keep businesses up and running and to protect employees. Here are 10 strategies and measures business leaders can implement to ensure this new way of working keeps working for everyone:1. Companies need to recognise the importance of supporting employees’ mental healthBusinesses have long known the importance of financial resilience. But this year, many have learned the importance of “emotional resilience” – something that can only be achieved by being supportive of employees’ mental health. Businesses need to acknowledge that Covid-19 has affected us all – and has caused a rise in mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Business leaders need to support employees through a variety of measures, including keeping in regular contact, focusing on work-life balance, and promoting access to support services. Above all, managers need to show understanding and flexibility.2. Guard against the emergence of a two-tier workforceSome employees may be happier to come into the office more regularly, while others might prefer heeding government advice to work from home where possible. But it’s important to guard against the emergence of an inefficient two-tiered workforce, where teamwork can be hampered by feelings of resentment.After all, work isn’t a one-size-fits-all proposition. Workplaces are erse – comprising traditional offices, call centre operations, manufacturing floors, retail locations, and more.6. Be aware of burnout Unfortunately, working from home can make people even more anxious about booking time off work. Leadership needs to stress that time off is essential and encourage employees to take time away from the office – even if that office is in their kitchen. Burnout leads to decreased productivity, so it is beneficial for both employees and employers to encourage a work-life balance.7. Employees’ working hours need to be respectedFor some employees, working from home translates into working all the time. They may feel like they need to overwork themselves to prove they’re doing a good job or simply have a hard time stopping without the ritual of leaving a physical office. Managers should emphasise that work done during normal office hours is valued, and model this behaviour by working reasonable hours themselves.8. Respect your employees’ work preferencesWhile it should go without saying that staff shouldn’t be pressured into the office against government advice, there are other reasons to remain flexible about office working. Some people are high-risk for Covid-19 or may live with someone who is. No one should be made to feel that this will impact their job security or career prospects. Equally, however, some employees who don’t have homes conducive to remote work may want to get back into the office as soon as possible. By supporting each inidual’s personal preference, business leaders demonstrate the caring and respect that leads to lasting employee loyalty.9. Safety measures beyond government requirements are a good moveSince the launch of the ServiceNow Safe Workplace suite, more than 550 organisations have downloaded the apps. This includes employee readiness surveys, health and safety testing, and automated contact tracing to help businesses reduce workplace transmission of Covid-19.10. Provide the digital tools that make it easy to get work doneCovid-19 accelerated the need for digital transformation for companies across the board. This was especially true as businesses scrambled to support the abrupt transition to remote work. Employees whose companies already had digital workflows and platforms in place were able to keep working far easier than those that still relied on manual, offline processes.By delivering employees the right digital experience, business leaders can increase engagement, improve productivity, and maintain business continuity. Just as importantly, by leaning into digital transformation now, companies will be better equipped to survive and thrive during the current crisis – and whatever disruptions come next.If your business has yet to adapt a digital workflow platform to support cross-functional collaboration, now is the time.However work works right now, you can do it confidently with the ServiceNow Safe Workplace suite.

But Hamburg in summer is a different story.On a sweltering day in August, I hired a bike and went west, out of the city centre, along the River Elbe. I had been told there were urban beaches along the river and I was keen to take a look.Away from the city’s hustle, I stopped to admire a cheerful-looking red lighthouse at the water’s edge. A terrace of cafes and restaurants looked over the river, with waiters rushing to and fro with large trays of beer and snacks for their many customers. Over the other side I could see a long stretch of sand, teeming with sunseekers.A narrow path led behind the restaurants, parallel to the beach. On my right were dainty, picture-perfect wooden houses, with roses around the door and parasols peeking jauntily from windows. Gardens belonging to the houses were on the other side of the path to my left, with families playing on the grass and elderly couples sipping cool drinks in the shade.Beyond the gardens was a beach scene like no other. A strip of sand, maybe 50 metres wide, was packed with people sunbathing, building sandcastles, playing beach games and generally doing what people do on beaches. It seemed like all of Hamburg was on the beach that day. But what made it extraordinary was the backdrop. Immense container ships cruised past, causing waves to crash on the shore for excited young children to jump over. And on the far side of the river stood colossal industrial cranes, like giant metal beasts, surveying the sun-drenched spectacle.I walked a little further, past the Ahoi Strandkiosk, and found a spare metre of sand to myself. A group of friends were enthusiastically playing volleyball in the water in front of me. I took a crafty shot, thinking they might not appreciate having their photo taken. But it soon became apparent that no one on this gorgeous summer’s day gave a hoot about some woman taking photos on a crowded beach. I snapped away at everything and everyone. This scene is a favourite because of the moment of carefree happiness captured between friends, against the backdrop of the city’s harbour giants – those majestic metal cranes.• Celia Topping is a photographer and journalist based in Berlin and London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8af29eeffd3f8f1fa3608befebd45468972572d/0_96_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d8ae0a3249fc387995179152535a8dfc","title":"wisconsin pharmacist covid 19 vaccine doses steven brandenburg","story":"Officers say Steven Brandenburg told investigators he intentionally tried to spoil the doses because he believed the vaccine could change DNAA Wisconsin pharmacist who was convinced the world was “crashing down” told police he tried to ruin hundreds of doses of coronavirus vaccine because he believed the shots would mutate people’s DNA, according to court documents released on Monday.Police in Grafton, about 20 miles north of Milwaukee, arrested Steven Brandenburg of Advocate Aurora Health last week after an investigation into the 57 spoiled vials of the Moderna vaccine, which officials say contained enough doses to inoculate more than 500 people. Charges are pending.“He’d formed this belief they were unsafe,” Adam Gerol, the Ozaukee county district attorney, said during a virtual hearing. The prosecutor added that Brandenburg was upset because he was in the midst of orcing his wife, and an Aurora employee said Brandenburg had taken a gun to work twice.A detective wrote in a probable cause statement that Brandenburg, 46, was an admitted conspiracy theorist and that he told investigators he intentionally tried to ruin the vaccine because it could hurt people by changing their DNA.Misinformation about the Covid-19 vaccines has surged online with false claims circulating on everything from the vaccines’ ingredients to possible side-effects.One of the earliest false claims suggested that the vaccines could alter DNA. The PfizerBioNTech vaccine as well as the Moderna vaccine rely on messenger RNA or mRNA, which is a fairly new technology used in vaccines that experts have been working on for years.Such vaccines help train the immune system to identify the spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus and create an immune response. Experts have said there is no truth to the claims that the vaccines can genetically modify humans.Jeff Bahr, the Advocate Aurora Health Care chief medical group officer, has said Brandenburg admitted that he deliberately removed the vials from refrigeration at the Grafton medical center overnight on 24 December into 25 December, returned them, then left them out again on the night of 25 December into Saturday.A pharmacy technician discovered the vials outside the refrigerator on 26 December.Brandenburg’s attorney, Jason Baltz, did not speak on the merits of the case during the hearing. Gerol held off on filing any charges, saying he still needed to determine whether Brandenburg actually destroyed the doses.Judge Paul Malloy ordered Brandenburg held on a $10,000 signature bond on the condition that he surrender his firearms, not work in healthcare and have no contact with Aurora employees.Brandenburg is in the process of orcing his wife of eight years. The couple has two small children.According to an affidavit Brandenburg’s wife filed, he visited her on 6 December and dropped off a water purifier and two 30-day supplies of food, telling her the world was “crashing down”.He had also said the government was planning cyber-attacks and was going to shut down the power grid.She added that he was storing food in bulk along with guns in rental units and she no longer felt safe around him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afcf923802ff34c7a5c528f2877e618d6f695736/0_196_2790_1674/master/2790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3415be1cd27f7e96e2e69c97f747f9c","title":"share your experiences of expanded coronavirus testing in the uk","story":"We’d like to speak to contact tracers working in the NHS’s test and trace system, and those who have been reached by tracersWith news that contact tracers in England are under pressure and failing to meet targets, there are continued concerns around the effectiveness of the UK’s test and trace system.We would like to hear about your experiences of the test and trace system, from contact tracers working in the system to those who have been reached.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

All non-essential shops were told to close from Monday night.The lockdown will last for at least seven weeks, with measures to be reviewed during half-term week. Any relaxation would not come into effect before 22 February.Just a day after urging millions of pupils to return to the classroom, Johnson announced all schools would switch to remote learning until the February half-term, and GCSE and A-level exams were unlikely to go ahead as planned.The prime minister said parents would “reasonably ask why we did not make this decision sooner”, adding: “I completely understand the inconvenience and distress this late change will cause millions of parents and pupils up and down the country.”In an 8pm address to the nation, the prime minister said he hoped that 12.2 million of the most vulnerable in society – care home residents and staff, frontline health and social care workers, all over-70s and the clinically extremely vulnerable – would get their first vaccinations by mid-February. The vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, later said these four groups added up to 13.9 million people in England.The UK was entering “the last phase of the struggle”, Johnson said, adding: “With every jab that goes into our arms, we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people.” The crackdown comes amid catastrophic figures for hospital admissions in England and warnings of a grim death toll by the end of the month. Johnson said:According to a  analysis, there have been 91,453 deaths in the UK with Covid-19 on the death certificate or within 28 days of a positive test. Given the current trajectory, the UK could reach the grim milestone of 100,000 deaths before the end of the month, experts warned.On Monday, the UK’s chief medical officers recommended that the Covid alert move to its highest level, from 4 to 5, meaning there is a “material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed” and necessitating extremely strict social distancing.“We are not confident that the NHS can handle a further sustained rise in cases and without further action there is a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days,” the chief medical officers of the four nations said, while urging those who still need emergency care for other illnesses to seek treatment.Other UK leaders also announced new restrictions. All schools in Wales will be closed until at least 18 January, while mainland Scotland will be placed in full lockdown from midnight on Monday for the duration of January. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said it was “no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year”.Northern Ireland also looks set for new curbs, with Arlene Foster, the first minister of Northern Ireland, saying the region faces a “very dire situation”.In his address to the nation, Johnson laid the blame for a third national lockdown squarely on a new, faster-spreading variant of the virus – despite widespread ongoing criticism of the government’s slowness to act.“There is no doubt that in fighting the old variant of the virus, our collective efforts were working and would have continued to work,” Johnson said. “But we now have a new variant of the virus. It has been both frustrating and alarming to see the speed with which the new variant is spreading.”Even in the past 36 hours, the prime minister had insisted schools were safe to open in most areas of the country. “There is no doubt in my mind that schools are safe,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr on Sunday.However, the prime minister was unable to identify what he believed had changed since the preceding days, when most schools had been told to remain open – only saying in his address that schools were likely to act “as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households”.Under the new lockdown, people in England will be ordered to stay at home from Tuesday and advised to leave only once a day for exercise. MPs are expected to vote the tough new measures into law from Wednesday, although businesses were advised to close from Monday night.Across the country, people must now leave home only for work – and only if it is impossible to work from home – and for essential food and medicine. Exercise with one other person from a different household is permitted but the advice is to stay local and limit activity to once a day.Other reasons to leave home will be limited to seeking medical care, fleeing the threat of harm and providing essential care.Nurseries, alternative provision and special schools will remain open and existing rules for childcare support bubbles will continue, but students will not be able to return to university and will be expected to study online from their current residence until mid-February. In-person teaching can take place for a limited number of critical courses, such as medicine.All non-essential retail and hospitality must close or remain closed. Restaurants and other premises can continue to offer deliveries or takeaways, but alcohol will no longer be permitted for takeaway or click and collect amid concerns about people congregating around pubs and bars.Places of worship can remain open and offer communal worship – subject to social distancing – as can playgrounds, but outdoor sports venues, tennis courts and golf courses must close. Outdoor team sports will not be permitted, but professional sports, including the Premier League, may continue.Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be advised to shield themselves as much as possible and should not go to work even if they cannot work from home, the government will advise.The lockdown is set to come into effect in law as soon as possible, with regulations to be laid out on Tuesday and voted through parliament on Wednesday – although MPs have been warned not to attend parliament and told to participate remotely.However, Johnson said the new rules should be followed from this evening, and businesses and the public should not wait for regulations to be passed.

The UK was removed from the list at the end of the Brexit transition period.“They all had a negative PCR test, but they forget the basic rule that it must be a necessary trip, for example for work or due to serious personal circumstances,” gendarmerie spokesman Robert van Kapel told the NOS public broadcaster.“People from safe countries are allowed to pass, but the UK is certainly not a safe country right now,” Van Kapel said. He added that some of the travellers “only wanted to visit Amsterdam”, while one man was planning to fly from Schiphol to Spain for a skiiing holiday. “That’s just not the intention now,” Van Kapel said.EU member states agreed in October to adopt a European council proposal to allow non-essential travel from a small group of countries with lower levels of Covid infections, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea.European nationals and British citizens living in the EU can still travel from the UK to the bloc with a recent negative test and proof of residence, while EU member states can in theory override the European council recommendations should they wish to.Few have, however, meaning that as long as the restrictions remain in place, British nationals can now only enter the bloc in certain cases, mainly for urgent family reasons, study, or work – including aid workers, care workers, diplomats, healthcare professionals, military personnel and transport workers.Since the end of the Brexit transition period at midnight central European time on 31 December, passengers from Britain who have a valid reason to travel to the EU must in any case also have at least six months left on their passport.They can no longer use EU fast-track passport control and customs lanes, and should be prepared to show a return ticket, provide evidence that they have enough money for your stay, and have their passport stamped.On Sunday eight Britons living in Spain were turned away from a BAIberia flight to Madrid. The airline refused to accept their green cards as proof of residence despite assurances by the British and Spanish governments that the old foreign national identification (NIE) document and the new foreign ID card (TIE) were valid.A small number of British citizens were also barred from entry into Germany. A Lufthansa spokesman said the airline was aware of a British citizen being stopped from boarding a flight in the UK after failing to prove their residence in Germany.Victoria Dobbie tweeted on Sunday that she was stopped from boarding a flight to Munich after Lufthansa rejected her rental contract, work contract and her German tax number as adequate proof of residence.Britons resident in Germany are not expected to receive new types of residence documents confirming their status for several months and Germany’s federal police have said border staff would also accept rental or work contracts as proof.There are concerns, however, that ground staff at airports are not qualified to assess the validity of documents and could demand proof residents are not legally required to present. British in Germany, a campaign group, has written to the German embassy in London to express their concern.A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said UK nationals who are resident in the EU and hold a residence permit, a certificate of application, or a document identifying them as a frontier worker should not be subject to Covid-19-specific EU travel restrictions.“They will not need a visa, should not have their passport stamped or be subject to routine intentions questioning, or be required to prove sufficient means of subsistence at the Schengen border,” said the spokesperson. “However, member states may require them to self-isolate or similar on arrival, provided they also require the same of their own nationals.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07ba32de7760ffa1f86de2ef80256b492865e9f5/0_19_4775_2864/master/4775.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=92c8f83765d14c388937a50a8f944a55","title":"abu bakar bashir indonesia to release suspected bali bombings mastermind","story":"Bashir was jailed in 2011 for his links to militant training camps in Aceh provinceIndonesia will release radical cleric and alleged mastermind of the 2002 Bali bombings Abu Bakar Bashir from prison later this week, the government said on Monday, upon completion of his jail term.Bashir, 82, who was among Indonesia’s most notorious extremists, is considered the spiritual leader of the al Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiah (JI) network. He was jailed in 2011 for his links to militant training camps in Aceh province.Bashir will be released on Friday “in accordance with the expiration date and the end of his term,” Rika Aprianti, spokeswoman of the corrections directorate general at the law and human rights ministry, said in a statement.Jemaah Islamiah is accused of plotting several big attacks in Indonesia and includes operatives trained in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the southern Philippines.Its members are accused of orchestrating the 2002 bombings of Bali nightclubs, which killed more than 200 people, among them scores of Australians, and an attack on the JW Marriott hotel in Jakarta that killed 12 people a year later.A senior JI operative believed to have made bombs for both attacks, Zulkarnaen, was among 23 suspected militants arrested last month.Bashir denied any involvement in the Bali bombings. A lawyer for Bashir did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment on his upcoming release.Security analyst Ridlwan Habib said that though Bashir’s stature has weakened, extremists may try to associate their activities with him to gain traction and boost their credibility.“Bashir is a senior figure in Indonesia’s jihadist movement, and it’s not impossible that his big name could be used,” he saidWhile seeking reelection, President Joko Widodo in January 2019 had considered an early release for Bashir on health grounds, but scrapped the plan after Bashir reportedly declined to pledge allegiance to the Indonesian state."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f101401cbe24bc0b57ac7b5ba674659f277a8e/0_2_1006_604/master/1006.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f5f117ba585222c568fe956e29cca37d","title":"tuesday briefing hardest yet lockdown for england","story":"Teachers’ relief as schools are closed, while Scotland and Wales bring in own tough measures … last push in US Senate runoff … Assange to make bail bidHello, Warren Murray here, allow me to enlighten you.England will enter its toughest nationwide lockdown since March, with schools closed until mid-February, as Boris Johnson warned that the weeks ahead “will be the hardest yet”. The UK’s chief medical officer has recommended the Covid alert move to its highest level, from 4 to 5, meaning there is a “material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed” and necessitating extremely strict social distancing. The lockdown will last for at least seven weeks, with measures to be reviewed during half-term week. Any relaxation would not come into effect before 22 February.Other UK leaders have also announced new restrictions. All schools in Wales will be closed until at least 18 January, while mainland Scotland is in full lockdown for the duration of January. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said it was “no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year”. Just a day after urging millions of pupils to return to the classroom, Johnson announced all England’s schools would switch to remote learning until the February half-term, and GCSE and A-level exams were unlikely to go ahead as planned.

My boyfriend, who kept his clothes in a large cardboard box, suggested that we make all our furniture out of cardboard boxes. It was an idea that had already been pioneered by Ikea, who made chipboard end tables with hollow interiors. Within a year, I had rolled up my mattress and moved my boxes to Iowa, where I found my furniture on the street.“‘A better everyday life for the many people’ is Ikea’s mission, on paper. I think of all the Ikea furniture that I have seen eaten by life. The end tables with broken legs, the cracked slats of futon frames, the chipboard desks left out on the kerb and destroyed by the rain before they can be taken to a new home. Ikea has made furniture into something that gets used up. It is furniture for the apocalypse.

Photograph: Marc O’SullivanThe Office of Public Works (OPW) has rejected a petition from a Green Party councillor for improved lighting in Dublin’s Phoenix Park, a move that it says would prevent light pollution and disturbance to animals.Chief park superintendent Margaret Gormley said the OPW did not want to encourage people to visit the park at night.Ms Gormley was responding to a request from Green Party councillor Darcy Lonergan who sought better lighting in the park to allow people, particularly women, to exercise there safely at night.However, Ms Gormley said that if people should do so, they should be able to “star-gaze” rather than run.“The Office of Public Works encourages the public to enjoy full amenities and resources of the park, from dawn to dusk,” she said. “We don’t encourage people to go through the park running at night. We’re aware people do, but we don’t endorse that.”Gas lamps were installed in the Phoenix Park in the 1850s. It is one of the last remaining public places in Europe that still relies on gas light, Ms Gormley said.“The decision to preserve these gas lights was made to support the conservation of the historic fabric of the park, but also to retain low lighting levels, ie low levels of light pollution, so the park is a place where people can star-gaze.”She added that the park was a “hugely important” wildlife habitat and supported 50 per cent of the mammal species and 40 per cent of the bird species found in Ireland. The deer were the reason the Phoenix Park existed as it was established as a royal deer park in 1662.“The low lighting levels support the habitat of the deer. Because the deer graze throughout the park at night.”Pollinating speciesArtificial lighting was also having “a very negative impact on nocturnal pollinating species”, she said.Maintaining the current low lighting levels to minimise light pollution was a “specific objective” of the park’s conservation management plan.“Thus the OPW has no plans to install additional lighting within the Phoenix Park at the current time,” Ms Gormley said.Ms Lonergan said she was not necessarily seeking more lighting, but added: “We just want better lighting.”“We also don’t want to light up all the Phoenix Park. This was a safety issue so people around the park can actually exercise after 5pm at night.”She was only asking for “the main strip” of Chesterfield Avenue to be lit up. It was already a busy thoroughfare for cars, “so I don’t think the wildlife would be coming that far in, and if they are they would be used to that type of noise,” she said.“This is about women’s safety, not only about women’s safety, this is about safety. It’s a safety issue people don’t feel safe.”Ms Gormley said the OPW had not been approached by the Garda to say there were any safety issue in the park at night.“People have to make a judgment call of where they go at night. This is not like a public footpath in the city – it’s a park.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450034.1609831423!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 schools likely to remain closed until end of month with cabinet sub committee to meet today","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChief medical officer Dr  Tony Holohan: ‘We are concerned about our ability to assure the continuing provision of any of the key public services we have tried to protect, and education is one of them.’ Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins Schools are likely to stay closed for at least another week and possibly until the end of January due to surging Covid-19 infections, according to senior political sources.Most Ministers privately believe that Cabinet will decide on Wednesday to delay the planned reopening of schools on January 11th, The  understands. However, officials may be asked to examine keeping certain schools open in Level 5 for pupils with special needs.Conversations are also taking place at a senior level about whether construction should remain open or not for the rest of the Level 5 lockdown.New virus case numbers on Monday surged to a new daily record of 6,110, making the current wave worse than the first one last spring.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan, who spoke on Monday with Taoiseach Micheál Martin about the schools issue, said that even though incidence among schoolchildren was lower than for other age groups, it had increased “very, very fast”. The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) was more concerned about transmission levels in this age group than it was a week ago, he said on Monday night. “We are concerned about our ability to assure the continuing provision of any of the key public services we have tried to protect, and education is one of them.”Saying he is more concerned than he was at any point in the pandemic up to now, Dr Holohan warned current levels of infection “puts many people into hospitals, and into funeral homes”. Wider restrictionsThe Cabinet sub-committee on Covid-19 meets on Tuesday to discuss the situation in schools and what wider restrictions may be needed. It is understood a decision may also be made after that meeting in relation to the ban on travel from Britain and South Africa, which was due to expire on Tuesday.Dr Holohan has indicated to Government that further restrictions may be needed to curb the spread of the virus.However, senior sources have warned that there is “not much else that can be done” when it comes to restrictions. There is a growing reluctance among Ministers at the idea of reducing the 5km travel restrictions to 2km.The latest Covid-19 figures are “beyond any projections and beyond our worst fears”, one Minister said.With Nphet reporting another six deaths on Monday, officials say there could be up to 2,000 people with Covid-19 in hospital, and up to 400 in ICU, by mid-January, unless Level 5 restrictions are strictly adhered to.Before Christmas, HSE chief executive Paul Reid told his board in a private report that it could not “guarantee a reasonable standard of care for all patients” if the numbers needing critical care exceeded about 350.Non-urgent careThe HSE on Monday confirmed non-urgent care in some hospitals will be cancelled due to the rise in hospitalisations. On Monday afternoon, there were 776 Covid-19 patients in hospital, including 70 in ICU.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the targets for vaccinations this week was being increased from 20,000 to 35,000 due to the availability of additional supplies.The PfizerBioNTech vaccine will be administered as originally envisaged with a three-week gap between the two doses after the National Immunisation Advisory Committee rejected the idea of giving more people a first dose and lengthening the gap between doses, as the UK has done.The European Medicines Agency will announce its decision on Wednesday on a second vaccine, from Moderna. If authorised, this vaccine should be available in Ireland “soon”, according to health officials.In the UK, Boris Johnson has introduced a national lockdown in England until the middle of February, closing schools and colleges and ordering people to stay at home.

Photograph: Laura HuttonThe acceleration of the Covid-19 vaccination programme should allow people in all 582 nursing homes in the country to be inoculated by the middle of next month, Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) has said.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said on Monday that the programme was being accelerated due to an earlier-than-planned shipment of 35,000 PfizerBioNTech vaccine, an increase from 20,000, that is earmarked for 20 hospitals and 25 nursing homes this week.Mr Donnelly said vaccinations will be increased to 40,000 per week as more supplies become available. HSE chief executive Paul Reid said that doses will be given out seven days a week.Tadhg Daly, chief executive of NHI, said that it was imperative that there would be a seven-day vaccinations in nursing homes “with supply being the only limiting factor.” “We would be hoping for a seven-day roll-out and we would be hoping for all nursing homes to be vaccinated by mid-February,” said Mr Daly.The Minister has said that the Government is planning to have all residents and staff in nursing homes, about 70,000 people, receive their first dose of the two-dose vaccine.Confusion surrounded an apparent delay in the roll-out at two State-run facilities in Dublin, Raheny Community Nursing Unit and Hollybrook Lodge in Inchicore, connected with Beaumont and St James’s hospitals respectively, not receiving vaccines as planned.NHI had been under the impression that both homes would start receiving vaccines on Monday based on a dated schedule of vaccinations released last week by the HSE. Hollybrook said it had never intended to begin its vaccine programme until Tuesday and that a HSE-issued timetable stating Monday was inaccurate. The Raheny home declined to comment as to why it did not proceed but said it intended to do so at some stage later this week. Sage Advocacy, the organisation offering support services for older people, said the apparent delay had prompted large amounts of calls from the public. The HSE said that vaccinations would take place this week in 23 residential care facilities, including seven in Dublin, two in Cavan and two in Tipperary. Sarah Lennon, executive director of Sage Advocacy, said there were some concerns about more Covid-19 outbreaks in nursing homes. “There has been a substantial number of calls through to our phone lines in Sage Advocacy today and hearing that the vaccination programme hasn’t commenced on time will cause some anxiety,” she told RTÉ’s Drivetime programme. “Every day that we miss on the programme is a day really where somebody may be exposed to this quite lethal virus.” Mr Daly said the health service had to “mobilise all resources now” to ensure all nursing homes receive vaccines and the older, vulnerable population are protected in light of the increased risks from records level of infection in circulation.“We find ourselves seeking to navigate a very dangerous juncture,” he said.“Vaccination is in sight for all nursing homes but the multiplying of cases in our communities has a direct consequence for nursing homes, with health experts nationally and internationally stating high-incidence in community has an inevitable impact on nursing homes.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4450022.1609795950!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tramore covid spike can be traced to several events at christmas says gp","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘People came together, they had the craic and had fun, and that’s what’s happened here.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireWith coronavirus numbers out of control in Ireland and many other countries, there will inevitably be intense focus on progress made by governments in vaccinating their populations against Covid-19.In 12 months’ time, the difference between a slow and a fast rollout of vaccines here will probably be measurable in terms of the loss of hundreds of lives, along with tens of thousands of jobs.So far Ireland has got off to a slow start, leaving the Government and health officials open to accusations of sluggishness and delay. By the end of December one in every 2,500 people had been vaccinated, compared with one in eight in Israel and one in 80 or so in the US and the UK. By that date 1,800 Irish people had been immunised, according to Our World in Data, compared with more than 40,000 in Denmark, a country with a slightly bigger population than our own.The criticisms will only intensify as soaring case numbers heap further pressure on the health service and force much of society to remain shut. The best answer to them is to make serious inroads into vaccinating the population, but this is contingent of there being enough supply.This, in turn, depends on authorisations from EU and Irish regulators, which have tended to lag behind other jurisdictions so far. Another factor is the size of the order made by the EU on behalf of member states for inidual vaccines.It was only after serious pressure from Germany that the European Medicines Agency brought forward its decision last month on the PfizerBionNTech vaccine, and now it is due to make a decision on the Moderna vaccine in the coming days.The agency is not alone among regulators in having issues with the application by OxfordAstra Zeneca for its vaccine, and its requirement for extra data to be provided has pushed back a decision on this until February.Workhorse vaccineThe problem is that this vaccine was conceived as the workhorse of European vaccination programmes, because it is cheap, easy to transport and works in a way similar to existing vaccines, unlike the PfizerBioNTech and Moderna treatments, which use novel technology.The EU went for a strategy of not putting all its eggs in the one basket by placing orders for six different vaccines. It may also, with the benefit of hindsight, have spent too long haggling over price. A number of last year’s likely contenders got delayed, and regulatory decisions moved slowly, leaving the bloc with insufficient orders for the vaccine that was out of the traps first, PfizerBioNTech.As a result, there is little point in the Irish vaccination programme “getting ahead of itself” until a secure and ample pipeline of vaccines comes on stream. Until that happens, we will have to make the best use of what we have. The UK has delayed the second dose of the vaccine so that a greater number can be administered a first dose and so enjoy the partial protection this offers. This approach has split scientific opinion. Even the drug manufacturers are ided, with Pfizer resolutely opposed to any delay in administering a second dose of its vaccine and AstraZeneca more favourably disposed to the idea.For now, this approach has been ruled out in Ireland but another idea we may adopt from the UK is to extract six doses from a vial of PfizerBionNTech vaccine rather than the recommended five. When the right needle is used, the content of the dose can be split six ways, rather than being used five times and leaving some fluid over. This could potentially increase productivity by up to 20 per cent.Who’s the boss?Some countries have decided to start their vaccination programme with working-age adults rather than vulnerable care home residents, but this approach is unlikely to find favour in Ireland.At this point, it is difficult to tell who is running the vaccine rollout programme here. Is it the Department of Health, which has decided the public health response during the pandemic? Or the HSE, which is administering the vaccinations? Or the taskforce that drew up an implementation plan and is still active?While the UK started administering the OxfordAstra Zeneca vaccine at 7.30am on Monday, Irish journalists seeking updates on supplies of the Moderna vaccine here were being referred by the Department of Health to the HSE, and by the HSE to the department. A plan for vaccinations in nursing homes was delayed on Monday, seemingly over consent issues. GPs are still wondering when they and their staff will be immunised.At least Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly was able to announce an increase in this week’s vaccination target from 20,000 to 35,000.None of these early teething issues will matter in the long run, hopefully, but greater clarity would do no harm.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449651.1609769845!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plain sailing at dublin port for start of first working week of 2021","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin Port’s system of streaming vehicles through the checks, while gardaí checked identities and ensured Covid tracking locator forms had been filled in, is working smoothly. File photograph: Alan BetsonDublin Port’s first working week of 2021 got off to a smooth start on Monday – due in part to the extremely low volume of traffic arriving from Holyhead.Cars and lorries arriving from the UK passed without a hitch through the European Union’s new trade border inside the port as well as the Garda checkpoint, where Covid locator forms were also required.The first Irish Ferries vessel to dock, the 2.40am Ulysses sailing from the Welsh port which arrived in Dublin at 6am, carried just 15 articulated lorries, one truck, two vans and 15 cars, together with a related number of passengers.One of the ship’s deck hands, surveying the vast empty space with capacity for 241 lorries and 1,342 cars as the ship set sail, exclaimed cheerily: “Brexit England – nothing we can do.”This may, or may not, be the explanation for the low volume making the early crossing from the UK but Holyhead port officials, and the shipping companies, expect Irish Sea volumes to increase sharply later this week and throughout January when importers, especially supermarkets, seek to replenish their stocks.However, complying with the requirements of the EUUK trade deal, in force since January 1st, can present unexpected difficulties, as Scott McCann, owner of Event Transport Ireland Limited, and Sean Carry, his transport manager, found on Sunday.Prior to Covid striking early last year, the company provided rigging for major events but, when the virus emerged and the live entertainment industry died overnight, Mr McCann’s business had to ersify fast or die as well. Now, 10 months later, the company has eight 40-foot-long articulated lorries crossing the Irish Sea daily, transporting goods for an international distribution company.With the new EUUK trade deal regulations coming into force over the weekend, Mr McCann and Mr Carry decided to stress test the system for themselves by driving a load over from England, just to see what their drivers faced.He already had Pre Boarding Notification (PBN) issued by the Irish authorities but without the companion MRN number, they would not be able to catch the early Monday morning Stena Line ferry from Holyhead to Dublin.They took a pit stop at the Holyhead McDonalds, hoping to hear from the broker that the MRN had come through.“We should have it within the hour,” Mr Carry said hopefully, having just missed the 8pm sailing.But it was not to be: as of Monday morning, both men remain stranded in Holyhead, frustrated as their predicament.More fortunate was Kaspars Ukis, the driver of an O’Toole Transport articulated lorry bringing a consignment of salads from the UK to outlets in Ireland. His papers in order, he experienced no difficulties but was anxious about Dublin Port’s capacity to cope when traffic volumes increase.So far, however, the Port’s system of streaming vehicles through the checks, where cheery customs officials waved most through without demur, while gardaí checked identities and ensured Covid tracking locator forms had been filled in, is working smoothly.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Variants of coronavirus have been around since the beginning of the pandemic and are a natural evolutionary process by which viruses adapt to their hosts as they replicate.Most of these mutations have no effect, but occasionally they can improve the ability of the virus to infect or become more resistant to the body’s immune response. This is one such occasion.The South African variant has three mutations in important genes. One, the N501Y mutation, has already been found in the UK variant and could be responsible for it being so infectious.However, the South African version carries two more mutations (E484K and K417N) that are absent in the British version and make it far more worrying. “These two additional mutations may interfere more with vaccine effectiveness in the South African variant than in the UK variant,” said Dr Julian W Tang, honorary associate professor and clinical virologist, University of Leicester.“This does not mean that the existing Covid-19 vaccines will not work at all, just that the antibodies induced by the current vaccines may not bind and neutralise the South African variant as well as it would the other circulating viruses, including the UK variant.”The South African variant carries mutations in a gene which builds spike proteins – the rod-like structures on the outside of the virus which attaches to human cells.Spike proteins are also produced by vaccines so that the body knows what to look for and what to fight off. So, any significant changes to the spike protein may mean the body can no longer spot the virus, even after vaccination or a previous infection, and antibodies produced in anticipation may not be able to attach properly in order to clear it away.Worryingly, the mutations may also mean that it is harder to pick up cases through the normal Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, so it could have already spread widely. It quickly became the dominant variant in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa.Yet there is still hope. Even if the new variant is more infectious, it may not cause more severe disease. England\u0027s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and chief scientific officer, Patrick Vallance, are believed to have briefed Boris Johnson, claiming they are not overly concerned about the new variant.And even if the South African variant becomes more widespread and dominant, both vaccines can be modified to be more effective against this variant in as little as six weeks. Most scientists believe that existing vaccines will still work to some extent, even if the new variant lowers the overall efficacy. The mutations have not altered the shape of the spike protein to such an extent that antibodies cannot bind at all, they just may be less effective. “It is not anticipated that this mutation is sufficient for the ‘South African’ variant to bypass the protection provided by current vaccines,” said Prof Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology, University College London (UCL). “It’s possible that new variants will affect the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines, but we shouldn’t make that assumption yet about the South African one.”Researchers are working round the clock to find out just how dangerous this new variant is, and new lockdown measures introduced by the Government will undoubtedly help to stem the tide, and give scientists room to find a new solution.Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, and University of Oxford, said: We can all help if we redouble our efforts to wash our hands, wear a mask and socially distance.

So we deem it very useful if the Commission takes the lead in this process.”In fact, Europe began to fall behind in the race to secure sufficient stocks after the Commission took over.The four ministers had already negotiated an order for 400m doses of the Astra-Zeneca vaccine, but the Commission became locked in protracted negotiations as the UK and US secured large orders.The row came with the European Medicine Agency (EMA) poised to approve the Moderna vaccine this week. It will become the second vaccine approved for use in the EU, following the Pfzier-BioNTech vaccine.Jean-Claude Juncker, Mrs von der Leyen’s predecessor as commission president, spoke out against the EU’s response to the virus, telling Luxembourg’s Télécran magazine the bloc had “reacted very weakly”. But he added that the EU was hamstrung by the fact member states retain control of health policy.Mr Juncker claimed he continues to act as an unofficial advisor to Mrs von der Leyen, and compared himself the former Pope Benedict XVI.“I always say I am like Ratzinger in the Vatican Gardens: I am their Ratzinger,” Mr Juncker said, using Pope Benedict’s birth name. “She likes it a lot, and it gives us the opportunity to exchange ideas from time to time, which is very useful for both of us.

may be surprised to discover it actually went faster than you thought ... and this year is set to be even speedier.The Earth has been spinning unusually quickly lately, and July 19 saw the shortest day since records began, with the planet completing its rotation in 1.4602 milliseconds less than the usual 86,400 seconds.The previous shortest day in 2005 was beaten 28 times last year, and 2021 is on track to be the most nippy year ever, with the average day passing 0.5 milliseconds faster than usual.The changes to the length of a standard day were only discovered after highly accurate atomic clocks were developed in the 1960s and compared to fixed stars in the sky.In recent decades, Earth\u0027s average rotational speed has consistently decreased and timekeepers have been forced to add 27 leap seconds to atomic time since the 1970s to keep clocks in sync with the slowing planet. The last one was added on New Year’s Eve 2016, when clocks around the world paused for a second to allow the Earth’s rotation to catch up.Then, BT\u0027s speaking clock added a second\u0027s pause before its third pip while Radio 4 inserted an extra pip to its 1am bulletin.However, now the planet is speeding up and a negative leap second may soon be needed so atomic clocks can align correctly with the turning world. It would be the first time that a second has been removed from global clocks.Peter Whibberley, senior research scientist with National Physical Laboratory’s time and frequency group, said: “It is certainly correct that the Earth is spinning faster now than at any time in the last 50 years. “It’s quite possible that a negative leap second will be needed if the Earth’s rotation rate increases further, but it’s too early to say if this is likely to happen. “There are also international discussions taking place about the future of leap seconds, and it’s also possible that the need for a negative leap second might push the decision towards ending leap seconds for good.”On Sunday, the solar day lasted just 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59.9998927 seconds, then slowed down on Monday to a little more than 24 hours.However, in the course of 2021, atomic clocks are expected to accumulate a lag of about 19 milliseconds. While it would take hundreds of years for the difference to become obvious to most people, modern satellite communication and navigation systems rely on time being consistent with the conventional positions of the Sun, Moon and stars.It is the task of scientists and officials at the International Earth Rotation Service, based in Paris, to monitor the planet\u0027s rotation and inform countries when leap seconds must be added or taken away six months in advance.However, there can be consequences of tinkering with time.When a leap second was added in 2012, Mozilla, Reddit, Foursquare, Yelp, LinkedIn and StumbleUpon all reported crashes and there were problems with the Linux operating system and programmes written in the programming language Java.Some countries want to move to atomic time completely, and abolish leap second corrections, but the UK is opposed to the move because it would sever the link with solar time forever. The World Radiocommunication Conference will decide on the fate of the leap second in 2023.The speed of the Earth\u0027s rotation varies constantly because of the complex motion of its molten core, oceans and atmosphere, as well as the effect of celestial bodies such as the Moon. The friction of the tides and the change in distance between the Earth and the Moon all make for daily variations in the speed the planet rotates on its axis.Even the snow building up on mountains and melting in the summer can shift the rotation. Global warming will also have an effect by melting ice and snow at higher elevations, causing the Earth to spin faster, although only by a small amount.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad

ahead","story":"Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a strict lockdown until March with the promise that 13 million vaccinations will ensure it is “the last phase of the struggle” against Covid-19. He warned “the weeks ahead will be the hardest yet” as he ordered the closure of all schools from Tuesday and said GCSE and A-level exams will be cancelled for a second year.New laws banning socialising will come into force on Tuesday in a return of the draconian measures of last spring, but Mr Johnson asked the country to start obeying the rules straightaway.He set out a timetable for the NHS to vaccinate all over-70s, health workers, care home residents and clinically extremely vulnerable people by mid-February, which would allow the easing of restrictions, perhaps permanently.Mr Johnson said the lockdown will be reviewed at that point, with schools potentially reopening after the February half term.He said it takes two to three weeks for vaccine recipients to develop immunity after their first jab, with another time lag before the pressure on the NHS can be lifted, meaning “we should remain cautious about the timetable”.It means that most restrictions are likely to be in place until March.Until then he told the nation to stay at home and only to go out for one of five reasons: to work if it is impossible to work from home to shop for essentials to exercise to provide care, and for medical appointments.The national lockdown means all non-essential retailers will shut from Tuesday, together with gyms, hairdressers, sports facilities, pubs and restaurants.Exercising with one other person outdoors will be allowed, and childcare and support bubbles can continue. Nurseries will stay open.Mr Johnson also reintroduced shielding for the vulnerable, and said they should only leave their homes for exercise or medical appointments.He said he was forced to act because the new strain of coronavirus has reached every part of the UK, meaning that “if action is not taken, NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days”.The  understands that the tipping point for the Prime Minister came when he was told on Monday that more than 80,000 people had tested positive on December 29 – around 20 times the peak of last spring.Another 58,784 people tested positive for coronavirus on Monday, with 407 deaths. The number of people in hospital with Covid – 26,626 – is 40 per cent higher than the peak last spring. MPs have been recalled from their extended break to vote on the measures on Tuesday.Mr Johnson said he had been forced to close all primary and secondary schools just a day after the start of term, not because they are unsafe but because they are “vectors” of the virus.He added: “This will mean it’s not possible, or fair, for all exams to go ahead this summer as normal.”He said Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, will work with regulator Ofqual “to put in place alternative arrangements”.One option under consideration is for some core subjects, such as Maths and English, to be examined, with other subjects reverting to course assessment.Mr Johnson said: “The weeks ahead will be the hardest yet, but I really do believe we are entering the last phase of the struggle.“Thanks to the miracle of science not only is the end in sight but we know exactly how we will get there.” The Prime Minister, who had started the day celebrating the start of the roll-out of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, said that if the NHS can vaccinate all over-70s and vulnerable people by mid-February – 13.2 million people – it would protect the NHS from becoming overwhelmed.It will require more than two million vaccinations a week but could bring deaths down by 88 per cent, according to independent analysts.He said: “I know how tough this is and I know how frustrated you are and I know you have had more than enough Government guidance about defeating this virus. But now, more than ever, we must pull together.”The Government’s Joint Biosecurity Centre placed the country in Covid-19 alert Level 5 for the first time since the system was introduced last year, meaning there is “a material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed”.In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon announced similar measures hours before Mr Johnson, taking a swipe at him for failing to act earlier as she said Scotland’s infection rate was four weeks behind England, meaning he should have acted a month ago.Wales and Northern Ireland were already in lockdowns imposed last month.A snap poll by YouGov showed 79 per cent of the population supported another national lockdown, with 62 per cent saying reopening primary schools had been the wrong decision.     More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"explains new york timess delusional view britain","story":"The New York Times continued its portrayal of these isles as a softcore Mordor last week, with a bizarre op-ed decrying Britain’s final departure from the EU, and a downright misleading story on its coronavirus vaccine strategy. Nothing new there — the NYT has become a running joke on these shores for the standard of its dispatches from Albion. Such is the frequency of the inaccuracies, one might almost think they were deliberate. Perhaps we have brought it on ourselves heaven knows the British harbour unflattering views of the average American, existing on a spectrum somewhere between Homer Simpson and Eric Cartman. But the reasons for the NYT’s slanted view lie very firmly in the past, and its preoccupation with re-writing it to alter the present.It’s not just its dispatches about the UK that the Grey Lady has come under fire for recently — for a paper of record, it has recorded some howlers. The NYT issued one article, following a two month investigation into its award-winning podcast series “Caliphate” stating the paper had “fallen short” of its standards for giving “too much credence” to “false or exaggerated” evidence. Then there was the fallout over a comment piece, written by Republican Senator Tom Cotton, on deploying the US military against protestors over the summer, which led to the resignations of senior editor James Bennet, and star columnist Bari Weiss, the latter claiming she had been the victim of targeted bullying. Staff at the Times had apparently claimed publishing the column represented a physical threat to their wellbeing.Another NYT journalist, Nikole Hannah-Jones, led the charge against the likes of Weiss, and said she was “deeply ashamed” of the paper for publishing the Cotton op-ed. But Hannah-Jones, too, has been at the centre of fierce criticism as the architect of the paper’s feted 1619 Project (for which she won a Pulitzer Prize last year), the stated aim of which is to “reframe the country’s history by placing the consequences of slavery … at the very center of the national narrative.”Despite the accolades, the project has come in for intense scrutiny from an array of commentators and historians, amid claims it promotes factual inaccuracies to push an ideological agenda. The NYT initially defended it before later issuing several corrections — but it is through this last story that we can begin to understand the paper’s continued misreporting of life the other side of the pond. Americans tend to view Britain as a quaint place at best where everyone is either a cockney, an unemployed miner or a public school boy, where the food is bad, the teeth are worse, and we yearn for the days of red-coated flag-waving empire. For that last thing in particular, you can see why a certain animosity might exist at a newspaper bent on pushing a rewriting of history based on the transatlantic slave trade and historical injustice. Britain is the old colonial master — the birth place of the tyranny from which the patriots fought to free themselves, and the nation that brought liberal east coast America’s modern notion of evil “whiteness” to the continent. If slavery is America’s original sin (with an uncomfortable shuffle over questions on the fate of the natives) Britain is the serpent that despoiled this once tranquil Eden. Nor should we discount the fact that the NYT, based where it is, panders first to a community with deep Irish migrant roots, often away from the mismanagement and subjugation of their homeland by the British. All forms of Republican culture, from the country club sets and Ivy League networks to white trash and rednecks, are seen as Anglo-Saxon in heritage. Even the country’s hard Christian streak is typified by the arrival of the Puritan pilgrims aboard the Mayflower — so English that they broke with the Church of England for being a little too Roman Catholic for their liking. Britain, and specifically England, then, must forever be seen through this prism, as the backwards desolation America must leave behind - more a Troy to these Romans than a Greece. Combine that with the lazy comparisons between the Maga movement and Brexit, and the tenuous similarities between Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, and their fates, and you get the full package: America endured Trump and overcame, while backwards old Britain is stuck with Boris and Brexit. Not just a warning from history, but a live action alternative of how much worse things could be. If that is the fantasy world the paper wishes to inhabit, so be it. From afar, we have already seen what isive and delusional outcomes framing stories to suit your beliefs has brought to America in the past few years. Britain too has indulged in its fair share. But let us not pretend that it is anything other than fantasy, regardless of whether it’s a “paper of record” peddling it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"georgia run offs democratic odd couple carry joe bidens hopes","story":"The sky was pure blue and the trees heavy with Spanish moss on Sunday lunchtime when Jon Ossoff took the microphone in a park on the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia.“Y’all, Tuesday is it,” said the 33-year-old Democratic candidate for the US Senate, tie-less in a blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up. “Tuesday is everything.”Around 200 supporters had turned out, above expectations. Some muttered “yes sir” and “preach it” as Mr Ossoff’s stump speech outlined what was on the line.“The whole country is watching us right now,” he said. “The whole country is watching Georgia to see what kind of a statement we’re going to make about the values that we stand for, about what\u0027s in our hearts as a state and as a people.”He was not wrong. Across the rest of America, the US election - which happened two months ago - is already fading into the past along with the rest of 2020. But not in Georgia.Thanks to the quirks of the state’s electoral system, the occupants of its two US Senate seats will be decided on Tuesday after ‘run-offs’ were ordered when no candidate got more than 50 per cent of the vote in November.Hanging in the balance is not just state power, however, but control of the Senate. Currently the Republicans hold 50 seats and the Democrats 48 with these two races outstanding.Win both and the Democrats pull equal, with Kamala Harris, the incoming US vice president, casting the deciding vote - allowing them to control proceedings. Lose just one and the Republicans keep their majority and ability to veto measures.US president-elect Joe Biden’s legislative agenda is on the line.Those watching Mr Ossoff in the Savannah sun were pulling out all the stops to flip the seats in the Democrats\u0027 favour. Sam Gostomski, a 24-year-old volunteer checking the temperatures of attendees as a coronavirus safety precaution, had travelled all the way from Austin to help out.He was among a group of 25 young Texans who upped sticks to Georgia on Boxing Day to knock doors and help run events. Most had worked on the Biden campaign and saw the state as unfinished business.“All of that work doesn’t mean as much if we don’t take the Senate and get some reforms passed,” Mr Gostomski said. “It’s not an exaggeration to say this is the most important race in America right now.Mr Ossoff is a documentary filmmaker who shot to prominence in 2017 by almost winning a House of Representatives seat in Georgia and packs his speeches with lofty appeals to the greater good.He has a youthful exuberance similar to Beto O\u0027Rourke, the ex-Texas congressman who ran for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination.The Democrat seeking the other Georgia seat, Rev Raphael Warnock, is quite different. A 51-year-old African-American, he was the pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church - famous for once being Martin Luther King\u0027s congregation - before turning to politics.Rev Warnock’s addresses have the ring of the pulpit. Speaking at a drive-in rally also in Savannah on Sunday - his hometown - he referenced his spiritual upbringing while taking aim at his Republican opponent Kelly Loeffler, 50. “She’s been busy, as we say in church, calling me everything but a child of God. Lying on me, misrepresenting my record. We say in church, scandalising my name,” Rev Warnock said.“But that’s alright. My mumma told me that it’s not what they call you, it’s what you answer to. And in just a few days she can call me Senator Raphael Warnock.”They make an odd couple, these two politicians who carry Mr Biden\u0027s hopes of passing bold new left-wing laws. “My brother from another mother” is how Rev Warnock refers to Mr Ossoff. They also represent two cornerstones of the Democratic Party\u0027s support base: young progressives and African-Americans.To win, supporters and politicians on both sides agree, the Democrats need vast turnout. They did just that in November, registering scores of new voters - many African-American - and making Mr Biden the first Democratic presidential nominee to win Georgia since 1992.The signs are encouraging. Early voting, which tends to favour the Left, has been high. Polling averages suggest both Democrats lead by around two percentage points.Donations have poured into the state, with Mr Ossoff and Rev Warnock each raising more than $100 million, making them the best-funded Senate candidates in US history - though their rivals are close behind.But Republicans, who have dominated politics in the southern state for decades, remain hopeful. They believe the chance to rob Mr Biden of Senate power will reinvigorate conservatives eager to block progressive causes.Ms Loeffler, who is married to the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and estimated to be the richest US senator, dubbed her opponent Rev Warnock a “radical liberal” 13 times during a recent debate, summarising the key Republican attack line. Campaign adverts have dredged up controversial comments Rev Warnock made while preaching, framing him as anti-America. He in turn released a smiley ad of himself walking a puppy and while wearing a gilet to allay fears. It has been viewed 6 million times online. Mr Ossoff’s opponent, the 71-year-old incumbent Republican David Perdue, took a different track. He has attempted to ignore his young opponent, even refusing to debate him - leaving the Democrat free to answer questions next to an empty podium.The election\u0027s biggest unknown factor comes thanks to Donald Trump, who like Mr Biden was due to campaign in the state on Monday. His repeated insistence without evidence that mass fraud robbed him of election victory threatens to deter Republicans from voting.Furthermore he has gone to war with leading Georgia Republicans who have refused to meddle with vote counts to overturn Mr Biden’s win, most recently calling the Georgia secretary of state for an hour to demand action. The leaked audio triggered a new scandal.The political danger was evident on Sunday afternoon as around 50 Republicans gathered amid $50 cushions and wooden carved crosses at a boutique furniture store in downtown Savannah for a pre-vote pep talk.Tim Scott, the Republican senator from nearby South Carolina, praised the virtues of a sign he had seen in the Peach State which declared “pick peaches, not socialism”, hammering home the party’s main message while not mentioning claims of voter fraud.Both for some attendees that issue was front and centre. Melynda Loomis, the 52-year-old treasurer of the local Republican branch wearing a bright red MAGA face mask and a Trump Deplorable badge, expressed concern. “I’m terrified,” she said of the outcome of Tuesday\u0027s vote.Asked if the result will be close, she echoed Mr Trump’s unproven allegations: “It won’t be if you could only count the humans that are alive, but there are all the ballots from dead people.”Ms Loomis went one step further - she knows Republicans who will not vote in the run-off after losing faith with US democracy. “They don’t believe it anymore and that’s sad, she said. They don’t think their vote counts.If many others follow suit, Mr Trump’s last month in office could deliver a final irony: in pursuing claims of election fraud so relentlessly he could hand the Senate to the man who defeated him. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households.Read more on the tier system: All schools will remain closed until mid-February, with the possibility that these measures could be extended further.This means most secondary school pupils will stay at home until at least February half term.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another, in part because risks increase with age. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year group and very rarely the entire school could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"six british passengers held overnight swedish airport negative","story":"Six British citizens who arrived in Sweden on a flight from Manchester on Sunday were detained overnight in an unused arrivals lounge likened to a “jail” after their negative Covid-19 tests were rejected as invalid by border guards.They were part of a larger group of around a dozen people who were told they couldn’t enter the country after landing in Gothenburg airport because their PCR tests had not been conducted by an authorised provider, despite being given no prior warning of that requirement.I feel I\u0027ve been really treated diabolically, said British citizen Gina Smart, a 25-year-old teacher, who by 6pm on Monday had been trapped in the airport for more than 24 hours. I don\u0027t think that refugees would be treated like this.She said she was kept outside for an hour in -3C temperatures, left to sleep in a bare lounge, and denied food or bottled water for five hours.Border guards also rummaged through her luggage, she added. I said, \u0027why are you doing this?\u0027 And they said, \u0027because you\u0027re like every other country now - like Turkey\u0027.When the plane landed, only Swedish citizens were allowed to leave their seats, she said. Citizens of other countries were told they could only enter Sweden if they could show a negative coronavirus test less than 72 hours old from the UK\u0027s list of authorised providers.While most of those travelling had been aware of the PCR requirement, all were unaware it had to be from a specific provider - information that she said had been on neither the British embassy\u0027s website, nor on that of the Swedish police.Miss Smart, who is in the process of applying for Swedish residency, estimated that about 12 people\u0027s tests were rejected, of which around six agreed to stay on the plane and return to Manchester.The rest were then left to stand outside for more than an hour in temperatures of around -3C, she said.From the offset we were treated incredibly poorly, said British citizen Lauren Braithewaite, 32, who is also applying for Swedish residency. It felt like the police were using tactics to break us so we would give in and agree to taking a flight back to the UK.At 9pm, three British citizens, a Norwegian citizen and a Cypriot woman were admitted to a disused lounge, while a British couple and their two-year-old daughter were taken elsewhere.The five kept in the lounge had to wait five hours before they were offered food, and were initially given only cold water with which to make tea, which they had to microwave.It was just really demoralising, they were just completely trying their best to make me feel low, degrade me, just to make it really clear that I was from a \u0027third country\u0027, Miss Smart said.  At 12pm on Monday, Miss Braithewaite and another woman were allowed to leave when the Swedish authorities decided to accept their PCR test, which had been carried out by the National Health Service.By 6pm on Monday, Miss Smart was still waiting to see if her negative PCR test, given by a private company not included on the list of authorised providers, would be enough for her to gain entry. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tuesday morning news briefing hardest weeks yet ahead","story":"We are back at the beginning, at least on the slogan: Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives.

He was also facing a weapons charges after officers found him with two high-capacity firearm magazines when he was arrested, a police spokesman said.A pro-Trump rally in December ended in violence as hundreds of Trump supporters, some wearing the signature black and yellow of the Proud Boys, sought out confrontations with a collective of activists and counterprotesters attempting to bar them from Black Lives Matter Plaza, an area near the White House.By nightfall, vandals tore down a Black Lives Matter banner and sign from two historic Black churches in downtown Washington and set the banner ablaze.Video posted online showed people pouring an accelerant on a Black Lives Matter banner near the Asbury United Methodist Church and setting it ablaze in the street as others cheered and cursed last month. Mr Tarrio told The Washington Post he had participated in the burning of the Black Lives Matter banner and said he would plead guilty to destruction of property and pay the church the cost of the banner.Proud Boys is an organisation that describes itself as a club of Western chauvinists but has been categorised as a hate group by the nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center.The arrest comes as the US capital braces for potential unrest ahead of Congress\u0027 vote to formally certify Mr Biden\u0027s election victory. Some 340 National Guard troops will reportedly be mobilised in the city ahead of planned protests by Mr Trump\u0027s supporters which have sparked fears of potentially violent clashes.The president\u0027s supporters are planning to hold rallies on Tuesday and Wednesday to bolster Mr Trump\u0027s unproven claims of widespread voter fraud.Mr Trump has encouraged his supporters to attend the demonstrations on January 6, to coincide with a vote in Congress to certify the electoral college results. The president has hinted he may attend the protests himself, tweeting on Sunday: I will be there. Historic Day!However, Muriel Bowser, Washington DC\u0027s mayor, has urged people to stay away from the city\u0027s downtown area amid fears the protests may turn violent. These fears were echoed by the city\u0027s police chief Robert Contee on Monday, who warned during a press conference: There are people intent on coming to our city armed. Officials believe this week\u0027s protests could be larger than any other demonstration to date which has been held in the aftermath of November\u0027s election. Businesses in downtown Washington have already begun boarding up their windows in preparation for the protests. According to a US defence official, Mayor Bowser has requested to have National Guard members on the streets from Tuesday to Thursday to help with the protests. The official said the additional forces will be used for traffic control and other assistance but they will not be armed or wearing body armour. Some 340 National Guard members will be activated, with about 115 on duty in the streets at any given time, according to the official.At least four protests are expected on Wednesday. The US National Park Service - which manages federal land - said it has received three separate applications for pro-Trump protests on Tuesday or Wednesday, with an estimated maximum attendance at around 15,000 people. On Monday, a stage was being assembled for one of the protests on The Ellipse, just south of the White House.Organisers plan to rally on Tuesday evening at Freedom Plaza and again all day Wednesday on the Ellipse, including a 1 pm Wednesday march to the Capitol. Among those expected to attend are Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who attempted to help the president overturn the election result, and Republican strategist Roger Stone, a longtime friend of Mr Trump whose three-year prison sentence was recently commuted by the president.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus ruthlessly exposed inequalities ","story":"NewsCoronavirus ruthlessly exposed inequalities – with most deprived twice as likely to dieA report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank and Nobel Prize-winning economist Sir Angus Deaton found the pandemic revealed and caused deep unfairness which may threaten the fabric of societymirrorShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  JAN NewsThe study uncovered the depth of poverty some people have been brought to due to the coronavirus\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank and Nobel Prize-winning economist Sir Angus Deaton found the pandemic revealed and caused deep unfairness which may threaten the fabric of society. Their inquiry shows Covid- mortality rates have been around twice as high in the most deprived communities as in the least deprived. It also finds many ethnic minority groups have suffered much higher rates of mortality than the white majority. And report author Sir Angus has warned that without urgent action, these gaps will widen further. His report says there is a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to tackle the disadvantages faced by many that this pandemic has so devastatingly exposed”. “We now face a set of challenges which we cannot duck”, it adds. Sir Angus said: “As the vaccines should, at some point this year, take us into a world largely free of the pandemic, it is imperative to think about policies that will be needed to repair the damage and that focus on those who have suffered the most. “We need to build a country in which everyone feels that they belong.” It also reveals how the best-paid and most highly educated have been “much better able to ride out the crisis”, it says, with many in occupations they could continue from the safety of their homes.

When Boris Johnson announced the lockdown last night he had suggested it could end as early as February , but that date appeared to change this morning.Speaking on Sky News, Mr Gove warned that the country was in for a “very dficult” few weeks and could give no firm date for lting the lockdown. He told Sky News: “The Government is doing everything it can in order to ensure that we can roll out the vaccine more rapidly, help the vulnerable by getting the inoculations they need and make sure that at the end of what will inevitably be very, very dficult weeks, that le can eventuallyto normal.” Pressed on whether the lockdown was likely to last until March, Mr Gove added: “We will be able to review the progress that we’ve made on February , just before the traditional school half-term, and we hope that we will be able to progressively lt restrictions after that but what I can’t do is predict – nobody can predict – with accuracy exactly what we will be able to relax and when. “What we do know is that the more effective our vaccination programme, the more people who are protected in that way, the easier it will be to lt these restrictions.” He added: I think it’s right to say that as we enter March, we should be able to lt some of these restrictions but not necessarily all.Mr Gove confirmed that Chancellor Rishi Sunak will also unveil support packages for businesses later today. Last night, Mr Johnson shut schools to most pupils and imposed the toughest restrictions since March in an attempt to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed by surging coronavirus infections.In a televised address to the nation on Monday evening, the Prime Minister pinned hopes on the rollout of vaccines to ease the restrictions in mid-February.  He ordered the country to stay indoors other than for limited exceptions and bowed to signicant pressure to order primary schools, secondaries and colleges to move to remote teaching for the majority of students from Tuesday. His move followed Nicola Sturgeon imposing a lockdown on Scotland for the rest of January, with a legal requirement to stay at home and schools closed to most pupils until February. Schools and colleges in Wales will also remain closed until at least January  and move to online learning, while in Northern Ireland – which is already under a six-week lockdown – “stay at home” restrictions will be brought back into law and a period of remote learning for schoolchildren is to be extended. In a bleak statement, Mr Johnson said the new iant of coronavirus, which is up to % more transmissible, was spreading in a “frustrating and alarming” manner and warned that the number of Covid- patients in English hospitals is % higher than the first peak. “The weeks ahead will be the hardest yet but I really do believe that we’re entering the last phase of the struggle, because with every jab that goes into our arms we’re tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people,” the Prime Minister said. He said people in the top four priority groups would be offered a first vaccine dose by mid-February “ things go well and with a fair wind in our sails”, to allow restrictions to be eased.

Labour branded Christopher Pincher as truly out of touch after he suggested people should see off a rotten  with a toast of eye-wateringly expensive bubbly while more than half a million Brits live with rent arrears or in temporary accommodation. In a column for the magazine The Critic, Mr Pincher, who is Minister of State for Housing, told readers not to buy Tory favourite Dom Perignon, in favour of the cheaperKrug Grand Cru Cuvée which at £ he describes as tasting like a tart satsuma with a light, tight, nutty effervescence. He wrote that the balance busting bubbly is ideal for lting the spirit and lighting up a darkening winter afternoon He added: So,you have the chance, or the wherewithal to buy a bottle, these bubbles will brighten your family bubble and provide an alternative vaccine until the real thing provides more permanent inoculation against the memory of last year.

All schools must shut until at least the February half-term and you must stay at home except for five specic reasons. Shielding will resume and all pubs must shut - with takeaway pints banned. Boris Johnson gave a TV address after , people tested on a single day - December  - came back positive.England has , patients in hospital, % more than during the first peak of the virus in April, as a new iant rips through the nation. And the case rate in England up to December  was over  per , - three times the . on December . The lockdown will begin tonight but only actually begin in law as soon as possible - probably tomorrow or the next day. People and businesses are being asked to follow the rules from now, even before they become law. How will the new lockdown affect you  Have your say in the comments below. The new lockdown applies across the whole of England, even the Scilly Isles which had been in Tier . There is no set end date, but it will be reviewed by February . People who have been vaccinated will not be exempt from any lockdown rules. MPs will get a vote on the new measures when parliament is recalled on Wednesday. There is likely to be fury at the PM for delaying over precious days after he knew the new iant was spreading through society. The lockdown is more similar to the first one in March than the most recent in November but there are subtle dferences. Here are the new rules that have been announced and what they mean for you. Full details are also published on gov.uk here. aposStay at homeapos order  There will be a very firm “stay at home” message similar to the March lockdown - and effective immediately. You may leave home for one of these five specic reasonable excuses:To go to work or volunteerit’s impossible to do so from home, e.g. a construction or critical worker who can’t work from home. To shop for necessities including food and medicine. To exercise, which can be with your household or up to one other person from outside your household or bubble. The exercise should ideally be limited to once per day. Guidance is that people should try to do this locally. To provide care or help to a vulnerable person. This includes buying food or medicine for a disabled person or someone self-isolating. To attend medical appointments or seek medical care or fleeing the threat of harm or violence.There are other aposreasonable excusesapos on top of these main five ones. You may also leave home for education and registered childcare,your children are eligible to attend despite closures. You may also leave home to be with your childcare or support bubble,you have one, but you are advised to keep it local. You can also leave home to:provide emergency assistance be with someone giving birth visit someone who is dying visit a care home, hospital or hospice resident fulfil animal welfare reasons including going to a vet attend a support groupattend communal worship or le events such as weddings and funerals fulfil a legal obligation carry out activity related to buying, selling, letting or renting a property fulfil respite care where that care is being provided to a vulnerable person or a person with a disability, or is a short break in respect of a looked-after child.Police will have legal powers to enforce through fines and dispersing orders. Fines will stay at their current level of £ for a first offence. Schools, education and childcare  All primary schools, secondary schools and colleges will shut to almost all pupils from tomorrow. Only children of key workers and vulnerable kids can attend in person. Others will learn remotely. This is in line with the March lockdown and much stricter than the November lockdown. There will be a system to get free school meals to eligible kids but it hasn’t been announced or rolled out yet. BTec exams will go ahead this week but GCSEs and A-levels this summer are unlikely to proceed as planned. Boris Johnson said: We recognise that this will mean it is not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer as normal. The Education Secretary will work with Ofqual to put in place alternative arrangements. Thereaposs no current plan announced to hand out more laptops to disadvantaged children, but itaposs something ministers are looking at.Early years such as nurseries alternative provision and special schools remain open in the lockdown. Nursery age, vulnerable kids and kids of critical workers over  can still attend childcare. University students will not be able toand will be expected to study from their current residence where possible until at least mid February. In person teaching at university will only be allowed for a small number of critical courses previously announced such as those studying to work in the health service. Meeting friends and family  You cannot meet people from outside your household or bubble anywhere - indoors or outdoors. The only exemption is that one person can take exercise outside with one person from another household. But you cannot sit down and have a drink together in the park, as you could previously under Tier . You also canapost do anything that counts as recreation and leisure with them, which was allowed under the November lockdown. When you do meet one person from outside your household, you should stay two metres apart, orthataposs not possible, one metre with extra precautions. Under Tier , children under  or certain adults with care needs didn’t count towards that two-person limit. It’s not fully clear yetthat rule has survived into the full lockdown. Boris Johnson saidpeople were shielding before, they must begin shielding again. They will receive inidual letters shortly. However, itaposs thought that, practically, rules for the million-plus previous shielders remain as they currently are in Tier . The ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’ should stay at home as much as possible and should only leave for exercise and health appointments. They should not go to work eventhey cannot work from home, and avoid busy places including shops and pharmacies. But there is not a special support or food parcel package like there was in March. Contrary to reports, the shielding group is not being expanded to include blanket groups such as the over-s. Support bubbles  Support and childcare bubbles will remain as they currently are under the new lockdown. Support bubbles allow a single-adult household, or a couple with a child under one, to permanently ‘bubble up’ with one other household of any size. They can act as though they’re in the same household. A childcare bubble is where one household links with one other household to provide informal childcare - unpaid and unregistered - to anyone under .Children of orced parentsChildren of orced or separated parents can continue to move freely between both parents’ homes, as in previous lockdowns. Furlough  There is no change to furlough in today’s announcement. Employees not at work can be paid % of their usual salary up to a cap of £, a month, funded by the government. It applies to anyone who was employed on October  last year. The furlough scheme has been extended several times and currently expires on April . Parents who can be at work themselves, but have kids out of school, can be furloughed but that’s up to the employer. Unions have called for firms to “do the right thing and support parents” who can’t work due to childcare responsibilities. All non-essential shops shut  All non essential retail, hospitality and personal care services must shutnot already, and remain closed. Essential retailers which include supermarkets, pharmacies, garden centres, and buildersapos merchants may stay open. Non-essential retail stores that must shut include: clothing and homeware stores, vehicle showroomsbetting shops tailors tobacco and vape shops electronic goods and mobile phone shops auction housesmarket stalls selling non-essential goods.All pubs, cafes and restaurants shut - and takeaway pints banned  Restaurants, cafes, pubs and other hospitality venues must shut. They can continue doing delivery or takeaway - but only for food. Takeaway pints will no longer be allowed from pubs. This is a tightening of the rules since Tier  after people got drinks and gathered outside venues. However, you will be able to walk to a pub, restaurant or other outlet and pick up takeaway food. Andyouaposre getting your takeaway delivered, rather than picking it up, it can come with alcohol.

Gareth Sumner, , was caught downloading child abuse images, including the rape of children, onto two devices. Sumner was spared jail after a defence lawyer explained how\u2028 the grieving widower descended into this world. His we Laura Pemberton, , from Huyton, died in June , just six weeks after being told\u2028 she had a rare and aggressive form of cancer. She walked down the aisle with her partner and the dad to her three\u2028 children the day before she died. Sumner appeared in the dock at Liverpool Crown Court, having\u2028 admitted downloading indecent images of children when high on drink\u2028 and drugs. Charles Lander, prosecuting, said police raided the familyaposs home in\u2028 Fazakerley, Liverpool, on December , . Sumner denied being responsible for any illegal internet use, before\u2028 the ex-security worker handed over a mobile phone. The court heard it was immediately apparent the device contained\u2028 indecent images of young girls and he was arrested.  However, when interviewed, Sumner suggested his Facebook account had\u2028 been hacked and someone  was responsible. A second phone was also recovered from his home and when the two\u2028 devices were analysed,  indecent images were found. Police experts discovered nine Category A - the most serious category\u2028 - files, including one video, showing children being raped. There were a further  Category B and  Category C images, along\u2028 with one extreme porn image. The images were downloaded over a near three-year period, between\u2028February  and December . Mr Lander said there was evidence of internet searches using terms\u2028including pre-teen, jail bait and candy doll. Sumner was interviewed again, but still denied responsibility, and was set to stand trial last year. However, ahead of the trial he admitted three counts of downloading\u2028 and one of possessing indecent images, plus one count of possessing\u2028 extreme porn. He has four previous convictions for four unrelated offences, between\u2028  and , all resulting in discharges or fines. Andrew Costello, defending, accepted there was minimisation by\u2028 Sumner of his offending in a pre-sentence report.  Judge Gary Woodhall said: Itaposs more than a minimisation isnapost it Mr\u2028 Costello  Itaposs actually a denial of the offences - he denies\u2028 knowledge. Mr Costello said the author of the report found his client had show n\u2028either an inability or reluctance to accept his conduct. He said although Sumner repeated the claim that he had been hacked, he\u2028 now accepted downloading the images and stood by his guilty pleas. Mr Costello said Laura was diagnosed with cancer when their son and\u2028 two daughters were aged  months and four and five-years-old\u2028 respectively. He said: He and his partner, there was a lot of coverage of the\u2028situation, because she sadly passed away within six weeks of being\u2028 diagnosed. They were married and then she passed away, very shortly thereafter.\u2028 He struggled to deal with that situation, as one might expect. Two years later, the family home was burgled and the photos he had of\u2028 his late we were stolen within that burglary. He added: At that point his world fell apart further than it already\u2028 had with her loss.  Judge Woodhall said: I follow all of that Mr Costello, which is\u2028 powerful mitigation, but it cannot explain and does not explain a\u2028 sexual interest in children. Mr Costello said it was not intended to, but the events prompted a\u2028descent into a very dferent lestyle involving alcohol and drug\u2028 misuse, including taking ketamine. He said his client entered into a world, existing in the night hours\u2028 and downloaded a lot of the images in the early hours of the morning\u2028 when undoubtedly under the influence of drugs and showing\u2028disinhibited behaviour. Mr Costello added: It might be some explanation how he descended into\u2028 this world. He said: As a result of all these activities his children are now\u2028living with family. He has supervised contact with them through court\u2028 orders. Heaposs lost his accommodation. He lives a short distance from the court\u2028 building at this time, in temporary accommodation. Mr Costello said although never acceptable, the number of images was\u2028not the highest in these types of cases and the Probation Service\u2028 believed work could be done with Sumner. He said: Heaposs in a position where he wants to undertake that work and\u2028 explore further how he ended up here. Judge Woodhall said to Sumneraposs credit he now abandoned his claims of\u2028 innocence and accepted responsibility.

He added: “The council sent drones up to see what was going on and we heard nothing back. People are sick of it.  “With this black mould I have to keep wiping it down with bleach because I have health problems with diabetes. “Other residents have health conditions too but the council just doesnapost want to know and it’s getting worse every year.

Alexander Parkin, , who worked on the popular Radio  show Late Junction and won nine Sony awards for his work, was first convicted of drug dealing in . Back then he admitted selling GBL to celebrity barrister Henry Hendron after the death of Hendron’s -year-old boyfriend Miguel Jimenez.Hendron was sentenced to  hours of unpaid work after pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply. Parkin also faced a trial in  over claims he had been selling crystal meth, ecstasy and ‘liquid ecstasy’ GBL from his Marylebone flat - but was cleared.  But he has now admitted possession of crystal meth with intent to supply and being concerned in the supply of the Class A drug after g was found in his flat on September  last year. Kingston Crown Court heard the Oxford graduate now has an interior design business, and befriends clients before inviting them to his parties and selling chemsex drugs at ‘cost prices’. It was said he was selling crystal meth for around £ a gram and not making a profit. Experts analysed Parkin’s phone messages in which he used drug slang including ‘Fanta’ for MDMA, ‘water’ for GBL, and ‘tea’ for crystal meth. Jonathan Hardy, defending, said: “One of his character traits is warmth, love and generosity towards others. That may seem alien in the drug world.” Judge Jonathan Davies replied: “This is exceptional, doing it out of generosity.”  The court heard police arrived at Parkin’s south London flat after finding evidence on another suspect’s phone that he had been drug dealing. A specialist search team found g of methamphetamine hidden in the flat “within home-made concealments”. Prosecutor David Povall said: “It is accepted that Mr Parkin himself is a drug user, an addict. “The people he engaged with are not only known to Mr Parkin but many of them are known to each other as well. “It is a networked supply situation which takes place within the inidual’s own social lives.”The prosecutor said there was “some” financial motive but there were no accounts to estimate a profit. Parkin’s lawyer said the drugs were not sold for profit but for “pleasure” at sex parties because his client is a “party man”. He said: “The defendant can now be recognised as someone who supplied only to friends… He did not seek to make a profit beyond his own personal re-investment. “In general terms my client supplied to those who he trusted and had a degree of emotionalnot physical intimacy, and it was very much taken in the confines of his home.” "},{"url":null,"title":"exercise only allowed once day","story":"NewsExercise only allowed once a day under new lockdown as all gyms set to closeSimilar to the lockdown in March, people should ideally only exercise outdoors once a day and should try and do this in their local areamirrorShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video boris-johnson-explains-new-lockdown-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Tony Le-Britton has collected some of the worldaposs rarest plants, including one previously thought to have been extinct. Turning his spare room into an incredible greenhouse the -year-old from Cheltenham said he had made thousands of pounds selling some of his rarer species. His prized possession is the Rhaphidophora Tetrasperma Variegata, the most valuable species in his collection. He said: The non-iegated plant is really common - you can pick it up in most supermarkets and garden centres. But my version, thataposs the genetic mutation - itaposs completely random, which makes it rare. Itaposs the only one in the world [with that leaf pattern]. I have already taken three pre-orders at £, each, per leaf. Thereaposs a waiting list. I have had so many people contacting me. Itaposs like growing money on trees. Tony is also the proud owner of a Monastera sp Bolivia - which is currently undocumented by science. He said: [Itaposs] from a botanical collector in Austria. I got it as a very small piece of stem. Itaposs grown to huge proportions.  I put a picture online and a botanist in the field in Bolivia got in touch with me asking for more pictures - he had no record of the plant. The only way to find out what it truly is is to find it in the wild. Using the stem and leaf, we can then identy the family it belongs to. A Begonia Chloristica, an exotic plant previously thought to have been lost in the wild, also has a special place in Tonyaposs greenhouse. He said: It was thought extinct up until a couple of years ago. I managed to find one from a collector in Europe. A hair and beauty photographer professionally, he puts his success with plants down to not becoming obsessed by them. He said his interest stemmed from his grandparents, who would take him to their allotment when he was a boy. He also remembers being sat at his grandmotheraposs feet and watching aposGardeneraposs World.apos  Tony said his grandmother Cora was known in the local area for her plant collection - which he tried to emulate. Stunning pictures now show the results of more than two decades of hard work - with two of his rooms filled with hundreds of plants. He said: It just stuck with me - I grew up in the garden. Itaposs all about the experiences I had when I was younger, being at the allotment with my grandparents. People always admired [Coraaposs] garden, and she made me a part of that. Itaposs in my blood I suppose. I didnapost study plants formally, but I feel like around  years of growing teaches you an understanding. You learn to just let plants get on with it. I think some people can over-care for their plants. In the living room, I set aside maybe three hours every three weeks. I cut off any dead leaves, check the roots and water them. The greenhouse is temperature, humidity and light controlled, so I can check everything is well on my phone. It really doesnapost take a lot. I do go in there every day - but thataposs because I enjoy it.

Felicity explained she didnapost know where she caught it from, perhaps at a shop or because her sons, aged  and , had brought it home from school. With the positive test result coming in on Christmas Day, Felicity decided to keep a diary of how she was feeling each day, including some of the lesser-known symptoms, such as a swollen and stf neck that left her feeling like a zombie. Sharing her diary on Teesside Live, Felicity said: There are thousands who, like me, have managed their symptoms at home - so here’s my experience.Below is Felicityaposs day-by-day account of her experience of Covid-, originally published on Teesside Live. Christmas Eve - Day One In the early hours of the morning I wake up with a temperature, a shocking aching in my bones, particularly my legs and lower back, and a thumping headache. By the morning the headache spreads to my eyes - I couldn’t open them more than half way and could only look straight forward as moving them left, right, up or down, hurt the muscles behind them too much.I also have a sore throat and feel hot yet cold.We are due to meet members of my family for a festive walk with hot chocolates in the afternoon, but despite feeling like I just had the onset of flu, I didn’t dare risk it. It’s the high temperature that made me go for the covid test. The kids symptoms are much less than mine at this point, but they still had a higher than normal temperatures so we all booked a test online at Canon Park, in Middlesbrough, at .am. This was the first test we’d had. It was a seamless operation from pulling into the test centre, being handed our packs to carry out a self test, swabbing both the back of our throats and nostrils, to leaving about  minutes later. Return home and treat our symptoms with cold and flu remedy and paracetamols but still felt pretty shocking putting out the lads’ presents on the night time.  Christmas Day - Day Two Woke up feeling equally as horrible as the day before - achey bones, head ache, eye ache, sore throat, hot and cold - pretty grim. Just want to lay down but can’t obviously so neck a couple of paracetamols and continue the festivities not wanting to ruin it for the kids. The eldest son is complaining of aching in his eyes and a sore throat, while the youngest is also having trouble with his eyes hurting. Then an email pings through and the dreaded news that we’ve all tested positive for coronavirus and must isolate until January . I can’t lie I did panic. Whatwe were going to get seriously ill  Was I going to end up in hospital  Would we be able to breathe  The thoughts are the worst. But you can’t do anything. This thing is in your body now and you just have to get on with it. Paracetamol and Lemsips become our best friends from this point. I get a phone call from NHS Track and Trace asking me about mine and the boys’ symptoms, who we’ve been in contact with, where we’ve been - so that these people and places can be contacted. You wrack your brain wondering when and where you’ve picked it up when myself and my whole family has been very careful since March. I’ve been working from home, visiting Aldi or Asda once a week for the shopping, and the boys have been going to school. This was the routine for  months. The only dference is I’d had a week off work in the run up to Christmas and had visited a few more shops such as TK Maxx, Next, Matalan, and all the supermarkets, looking for last minute Christmas presents. Anyone I’d met up with, friends and family, was outside for socially-distanced walks in open spaces, like the beach or the sea front. So my best guess is its either come from school or the extra shopping visits. Anyway, back to Christmas Day, pumped full of painkillers I managed to pull off a half decent dinner and a few games before collapsing to the couch in the evening feeling utterly dire. Boxing Day - Day Three Feel worse today. This was the first day the so-called’ brain fog hit. I’d heard of this but haven’t ever experienced anything quite like it. It’s like walking round with a cloud around your head. You’re completely wiped out. You can’t think straight. Even something as simple as what you’re going to make the kids for dinner takes a whole lot of mental effort. I feel weak, can’t hold my head up. Still can’t move my eyes properly, starting to lose sense of taste and smell. Eating a sandwich for dinner and could literally be eating an old boot….you can tell you’re chewing something but you can’t tell what it is. Underneath my tongue is swollen. Can feel a coldness in my chest but daren’t think about it. Refuse to acknowledge it because it makes me panic. Sleep the whole afternoon. Wake up when the phone rings and it’s the Test and Trace people checking to make sure we’re isolating. Would love to say I’d had the energy to escape….but no.  Sunday, December  - Day Four Wake up. Feel just the same. No let up in the symptoms. Eye ache, head ache, dizzy, weak, congested, pain in chest, hot, cold, tired beyond belief. Make the breakfast - wrecked again. Back to bed. Monday, December  - Day Five Wake up. Feel just the same. Boring now. So fed up. Mental health taking a battering. Feel like I’m in a groundhog day prison. I’m a fit healthy -year-old, I don’t smoke, and barely drink. Iaposd hate to think how this could affect someone  older or in ill health. If ever I doubted the importance of self isolation or social distancing, I now know for sure it’s there for a reason. Iaposd hate to pass this to anyone. Iaposm supposed to be back at work tomorrow. Message my boss and tell him I can barely lt my head off the pillow let alone sit at a computer all day and think. Was so looking forward to being off work in the run up to Christmas. Now I’d love to be back. Tuesday, December  - Day Six Wake up. Look around. Eyes aren’t hurting as much. Do I feel better  I think I do. Oh my god I think I might feel better. Buzzing. Get up, go downstairs and make a cuppa. Mam rings to ask how I am. I tell her I think I feel a lot better. Finish cuppa. Dizziness s. Eyes start going fuzzy. Feel a bit sick. Start with a cough. My condition check was premature. Wrecked again. By am I’m back in bed. Sleep until pm. House looks like it’s been burgled. Can’t do a thing about it.  Wednesday, December  - Day Seven Wake up. Look around. Pain in eyes about the same as yesterday. My neck hurts today. Touch it and it’s so sore. Get up and look in the mirror. The glands under my jaw have swollen up like Frankenstein. Looks like I have half an apple under each side of my neck. My lips are so dry and peeling. Eyes blood shot. What an absolute state. Test and Trace ring again. Like seriously, I’m not going anywhere. Leave me alone. Sleep again until the afternoon. Wake up and despite the big fat neck I feel a bit brighter. This must be good news. I’m gonna be sorted tomorrow. New Year’s Eve - Day Eight Don’t be silly. It’s coronavirus tricking me into a  set of pretences. This is is the absolute worst day. It’s like I’ve gone right back to the beginning and any progress I’d made has gone out the window. My neck is still swollen, I’m dizzy, have a shortness of breath, I keep going so hot I feel sick, but then start shivering. I’m like a zombie, so so tired. I lay on the couch with my eyes closed but am not asleep. I’m shallow breathing - literally can’t move. Starting to get panicked thoughts now. Why am I not getting any better. Am I going to have to phone for medical help  Eight days of feeling like this. I try to think rationally - I’m young, fit and healthy, but then what about the people that have died from this  Is this how they felt  No exaggeration I was paralysed at this point. Crawl upstairs to bed, sleep for four hours. New Year’s Day - Day Nine Wake up. Feel marginally better. The lumps on my neck have reduced. Parents deliver a roast dinner to the door step. Thank god as could not face cooking another half-hearted meal for no one to eat. Kids personalities are back to normal now. They’re fighting and laughing, just not eating as much. Don’t have the energy to tell them to shut up.

Lorna Whiston, , was forced to deliver her babies early in November to have scans and get treatment for Stage  breast cancer.Now she does not know how much time she has left with them, reports the Manchester Evening News.Lorna is undergoing treatment for the cancer at the same time as looking after newborn twins, Reuben and Arya, and her first son, Mason, who is three. The mum, from Cheshire, now wants to use her story to urge younger women to check their breasts, as the disease can develop at any age. Itaposs the second time Lorna has been diagnosed with cancer, the first being in February . I was playing with Mason, who was only one at the time, and he hit my boob and I thought it seemed a bit sore, she said. I felt it and found a lump, but I thought it was just hormonal because I was only  at the time and on my period. I had a biopsy and then on February , ironically World Cancer Day, I received my diagnosis of breast cancer. The young mumaposs treatment was vigorous she had a double mastectomy with reconstruction the following month, froze her eggs and six months of chemotherapy. After finishing her final round, Lorna rang the bell at Christie Hospital in Withington to signy the completion of her treatment on August .  When she turned around, she saw that her fiancée Jonny Parkes, , was down on one knee, ready to propose. By January , Lorna had been given the all-clear after a follow-up MRI which showed no evidence of cancer. However at the beginning of May, she says she had a aposfunny feelingapos and decided to take a pregnancy test, which came back positive. A scan three weeks later revealed she was having twins. She said: You arenapost supposed to try and get pregnant in the first couple of years after chemo, and it was an accident, but a good accident! Chemo can make you infertile and thataposs why I froze my eggs, and after you get told that you are probably going to be infertile itaposs all you can think about.  But we fell pregnant naturally, and twins were even more of a shock - I released two eggs but there arenapost any other twins on my side of the family. I was so excited and overjoyed, and both mE and Jonny felt blessed, like it was meant to happen. Her pregnancy continued normally until after five months Lorna started getting breathless easily, even after just going up the stairs she would want to sit down. She said: I thought it was just down to it being twins at first, but then in November I developed a little cough. The cough quickly got worse and after three days I struggled to get to the end of a sentence when reading a book for my son. Jonny rang , and Lorna was worried it could be Covid, so they went into AE on November  where an X-ray was taken of Lornaaposs chest. She said: They thought my aorta could be enlarged, which is dangerous for the babies, so they did a CT scan to rule it out and that was when they saw there was a mass just above my collarbone. Even though they couldnapost confirm anything, I immediately thought the worst and was a bit upset. Itaposs hard to hear it a second time once youaposve been through it all once.  After a couple of days in hospital and a biopsy, Lorna decided to have the babies early in case she needed to go ahead with cancer treatment. She said: They didnapost confirm it was cancer but they had a pretty good idea, and wanted to do a full body CT scan to check for any more masses so had to get the twins out. It was all a bit of a blur- we were rushing around to get things ready for the twins, but the decision to give birth early was a quick one because weaposd been thinking about it ever since they found the lump. Just one week after her biopsy, Lorna gave birth to her twins on Monday  November by emergency C-section. Reuben and Arya were premature, born  weeks and  days along, at lb oz and lb oz respectively and were taken to the neonatal ward for care. She said: I was so relieved because they said they might not come out crying as they were so young, but they did, which was the best thing. Lorna had her full-body CT scan the day after giving birth and, just four days later, was told her breast cancer had ed but this time it was at Stage  and terminal. She said: Itaposs hard, I have days where itaposs all I can think about whether Mason and the twins will even remember me because theyaposre so young. I worry the affect it will have on Mason because heaposs not old enough to understand, he just thinks mummyaposs poorly. Lorna, from Crewe, is four weeks into her treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and friend have launched a fundraising campaign to help her complete her bucket list. So far almost £, has been raised to help the young family buy a house, go on holiday - and for Lorna and Jonny to finally get married. She said: I want to marry Jonny, which we originally cancelled in order to have the twins but now weaposre bringing it forward and will have a proper party once the restrictions have eased! We really want to put a deposit down on a house to make some memories in and also offer a bit of security for Jonny and the kids, but I also want to go round the world feeding giraffes! Friends are also planning on walking  miles from Crewe to Chester in order to raise awareness."},{"url":null,"title":"my boyfriend been looking gay","story":"NewsopinionMy boyfriend has been looking at gay porn online and Im very confusedI’m not prudish about pornography, but naturally I’m now wondering whether he’s gay or perhaps bisexualmirrorShareCommentsByColeen Nolan:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsopinionI know from his search history that hes been looking at gay porn \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

We live together, but don’t have any children.We’ve always had a good relationship – we laugh together, we’re close friends and sex has always been good, too. However, the other night I was checking the internet history on a shared computer to find a shopping page I’d been on earlier and I came across loads of searches for gay porn.There’s no one  who has access to this computer, so it’s clearly my boyfriend. I’m not prudish about pornography – I’ve looked at it myself, we’ve looked at it together and I know he looks at it when he’s on his own sometimes.However, naturally, I’m now wondering whether he’s gay or perhaps bisexual. I’m shocked because he’s never mentioned finding men attractive since we’ve been together and I’ve never suspected he’s anything but a straight guy. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since, but haven’t been able to pluck up the courage to confront him.

The Prime Minister ordered schools to shut - after just one day back after Christmas - and told people again to stay at home in ato the stark messaging from March. But scientists have warned that the strict lockdown may not even succeed in lowering infection rates as the first national shutdown did last spring. A new national lockdown was still inevitable and necessary, experts have said, with daily cases yesterday reaching a record high of more than ,.  But the new virus iant is a game changer and its high transmissibility means the latest lockdown may not be as effective as the initial March shutdown, warned Professor Mark Woolhouse. The professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh said: The new iant is a game changer and made the Prime Ministeraposs announcement of a full national lockdown for England almost inevitable. Given the estimates of the transmissibility of the new iant, this lockdown may not be as effective as the one last March. It may be that the best we can hope for is that the situation does not deteriorate further. He urged the Government not to just focus on lockdown but to ramp up other measures such as mass testing, better surveillance of cases, and support for people required to self-isolate to maximise compliance with the crucial intervention. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome, said the point had been reached where national lockdown restrictions were needed immediately and called on people to respect the measures as health staff battle the virus on the front lines. He said: Healthcare workers are working with unselfish and inspiring dedication, but the demand is overwhelming the capacity of what can be delivered by these amazing professionals.  They must have all our support, meaning we all respect the restrictions, helping to reduce transmission of this awful virus, ultimately reducing hospitalisations and preventable deaths. He reiterated the importance of ensuring global access and supply of Covid- vaccines, warning: Leave one country behind and we are all exposed to risk, and to le taking longer and longer to ing to anything like normal. Professor Sir Gordon Duff of the University of Oxford, former co-chairman of the Governmentaposs Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , said the lockdown is justied in a time of national emergency. He said: The measures announced, although hard to endure, are justied. It was good to see the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition putting aside political dferences in the best interests of all.  There is no doubt that we face tough times, but vaccines will give us eventual victory. Sage member Professor Calum Semple said the easing of restrictions in some areas over the festive period, and the new more transmissible iant, made fresh national measures inevitable. The University of Liverpool academic told Sky News: Weaposre only now seeing the start of the price we have to pay for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day mixing. With that and the new iant it was inevitable we were going to have to hit a hard lockdown at this stage. His comments were echoed by Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Governmentaposs New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group . He said: The new iant made these measures inevitable and necessary.  The next few weeks will show whether they are enough to suppress the much more transmissible new iant which is now predominating in the country. Dame Til Wykes, professor of clinical psychology and rehabilitation at Kingaposs College London, said closing schools is not a decision to be made lightly but it is clearly the right decision to slow the transmission risk and save our NHS. She added: NHS staff continue to need our support. We donapost need to clap for them, we just need to stay at home and follow all the rules. The evidence is that most people are being very careful, but there are still some who think that Covid- is a myth or that they are immortal - neither are true.Dr David Strain of the University of Exeter Medical School, co-chairman of the British Medical Associationaposs medical academic staff committee, said: We welcome the PMaposs definitive actions to halt the rise in coronavirus and the hospitalisations that accompany it, albeit a little later than we would have liked and the science would have dictated.In a televised address to the nation on Monday night, the Prime Minister told the nation to stay indoors other than for limited exceptions, with measures expected to last until mid-February.

Many schools ed for just one day after Christmas on Monday, with the PM up to then resisting calls to close them nationwide But one statistic reportedly proved a tipping point in persuading beleaguered Mr Johnson that it was time to act. In his address to the nation, Mr Johnson said: Our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic. In England alone, the number of Covid patients has increased by nearly a third in the last week to almost ,. That number is % higher than the first peak in April. He said that across the UK, a record number of people tested positive for coronavirus on December  - , people. Mr Johnson said that over the last week the number of deaths was up % over the last week and will sadly rise further.The Dailyreports that the PM was told yesterday of the eye-watering number of infections on December , and it was that information that proved pivotal to him calling the new lockdown.In a televised address to the nation on Monday night, the Prime Minister told the nation to stay indoors other than for limited exceptions, with measures expected to last until mid-February.And the Prime Minister bowed to signicant pressure to order primary schools, secondaries and colleges to move to remote teaching for the majority of students from Tuesday. Mr Johnson said the new iant, which is up to % more transmissible, was spreading in a frustrating and alarming manner, and warned that the number of Covid patients in English hospitals is % higher than the first peak. As I speak to you tonight, our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic, he said. Pinning his hopes on the rapid rollout of vaccines to ease restrictions, Mr Johnson acknowledged how frustrated you are and that you have had more than enough of Government guidance - but stressed now, more than ever, we must pull together. The weeks ahead will be the hardest yet but I really do believe that weaposre entering the last phase of the struggle because with every jab that goes into our arms weaposre tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people, he added.  The lockdown will be brought into law as soon as possible, but Mr Johnson urged the public to follow the rules straight away. Mr Johnsonaposs statement came after the chief medical officers for the first time raised the UK to the highest level on the Covid- alert system. They warned the NHS is at risk of being overwhelmed within  days in several areas without further action. The restrictions are unlikely to be eased until around  million people aged over  or classed as clinically extremely vulnerable have received the vaccine and been given enough time to be protected - a period of about two to three weeks after getting the jab.

That was the start of the Industrial Revolution, which put the Great into Britain. But now it’s more profitable to send them home to work, employers are happy to do that. “Bosses predict the end of full-time office working” read the headline over a story that three-quarters of businesses will keep home working that was introduced last year. I suspect it won’t be a matter of choice, but a condition of the work relationship that passes for employment these days. Do you feel your bosses are benefiting from the pandemic  Have your say in the comments section Pandemics can produce profit. If it suits the bottom line, people will have to do the job from their child’s bedroom – or find other work. “Working from home, or workshy at home ” I asked early on. But productivity has held up well, because six out of  say they find it impossible to switch off.  Instead of working from home, we’re living at work. I’ve been doing it most of this century. Fragmentation of employment has been going on for years. Covid- has accelerated the trend, putting greater power in the hands of the employer, who no longer has to provide office space, heating, lighting or car parks. And there will be no office romance on Zoom.

With pub, restaurants and bars also closed - those living in Englandwill only have access to supermarkets and a few other retailers offering essential food and drink items. Much of the national lockdown restrictions will mirror those of Tier , where all non-essential businesses closed days before Christmas.Tonight, Boris Johnson addressed the nation with a firm stay at home message.Acceptable reasons to leave home are strictly reduced to travelling to workyou cannot work from home, to volunteer, to exercise alone or with one other person outside your household or bubble, to care for a vulnerable person, to attend medical appointments and to shop for necessities. When it comes to shopping, supermarkets have adapted how they operate throughout the year in order to account for social distancing measures and accommodate vulnerable customers. But how will the latest lockdown affect your local supermarket Asda Asda announced it would increase coronavirus safety measures at stores across the country in the run-up to Christmas.Asda also released a new virtual queueing app called aposQudiniapos which is available for all  main stores. It allows customers to wait in their cars until there is a slot availablethe store is busy. The  busiest stores will also have automatic counting technology which allows the store to control access and help customers social distance. In addition, the supermarket has added a protective antimicrobial coating to several customers touch points, such as fridges and freezer handles, in all stores. The coating adds a protective film which helps to kill bacteria and viruses and is being applied to all basket and trolley handles too. Face covering for everyone who is not medically exempt must also be worn. Tesco  Some Tesco stores have cordoned off non-essential aisles such a kitchenware and clothing. The superstore has also brought in a one in one out system that will be used to limit the number of people in stores at any given time. Social distancing will continue to be maintained while customers are shopping and face coverings must be worn unless a customer is medically exempt. The supermarket has placed staff at the entrances of larger stores to inform customers of the procedures in place and ensure they are wearing a face coveringthey are not exempt. A traffic light system has been implemented in some stores which will let customers know when they can enter safelyand when it is at capacity . Hand sanitiser is readily available for customers around the store and extra cleaning products for customers to wipe down trolleys and baskets will be available also. Protective screens have been installed at the front and back of all checkouts so they can all be opened to speed up serving time. Aldi  Aldi has introduced a traffic light system and was one of the first supermarkets to do so during the initial lockdown The store is encouraging shoppers to pick quieter times to do their shopping which is often between the hours of pm to pm. NHS and emergency services staff will be given priority access to the store. Lidl Lidl has no specic store-wide restrictions in place, but managers are able to use their discretion to limit panic buying. The supermarket asks customers to shop at quieter times and face coverings must be worn, unless a customer is medically exempt. Sainsburyaposs  Sainsburyaposs says it is constantly reviewing in-store rules. These include Perspex safety screens between checkouts and additional cleaning, to hand sanitiser and signs inside and throughout stores which remind customers to keep a safe distance. Queueing systems outside of Sainsbury’s stores will be implemented when necessary and only one adult per household will be allowed into the shop at any one time. Sainsbury’s will continue to be prioritising elderly and vulnerable customers for online delivery slots but no current confirmation is available on how long customers will need to wait for a slot. Elderly and vulnerable customers still have priority entry from  am to  am on Monday, Wednesday and Friday while NHS staff and care workers still have priority entry from : am to  am between Monday and Saturday.

Charlotte Greedy, , from Pontyclun, Wales, said when she first bought the rundown property it was filled with aposfags and drugsapos before she put her talents towards redesigning it. In search of a aposfresh startapos and with a shoestring budget the mum, who lives with her partner Harriet Waite, , and her two children, Enzo, , and Brody, , spent two years transforming the filthy tip into a dream home. Speaking of the end result she said: I love the outcome of what I’ve achieved here, it’s a great feeling knowing I have accomplished that when I had nothing to my name two years ago. “Everything I’ve done and continue to do is for my two little boys, I’ve worked my socks off to provide them with what we have now. Charlotte previously made headlines a year ago when she transformed a tiny space into a dream bedroom and play area for her young son for just £.She also completely redesigned a run-down, dingy bathroom for less than £ using eBay and BM Bargains. In a video clip of her latest project, she shared incredible before and after photos of the property, which she claimed was a pit of drugs, cigarettes and trash when she first bought it. After throwing herself into the project the home is now unrecognisable.She said: I’ve always had a passion for DIY and trying to do it on a budget where I can. “I’ve searched Pinterest since I was a kid and loved watching other people’s transformations, which then led to me doing my own. “I did the decorating all by myself. I couldn’t afford to renovate my kitchen and bathroom fully when I moved in, so I did them both on a budget. In redesigning the home Charlotte had to source budget materials to renovate her property at minimal cost, hunting for bargains wherever possible.  For the kitchen and bathroom, which cost around £ in total, Charlotte used vinyl flooring from BM and fastened it with spray glue. She also painted the tiles and kitchen worktop, as well as applied stick-on tiles to some surfaces and she ripped out old cupboards and shelves, adding a matte grey finish.

A yellow weather warning for ice remains in place until am in the East of England, Northern Ireland, the West Midlands, East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, the North East and the Grampians. Overnight temperatures are set to drop to -C in parts, with the daytime not a whole lot better as the mercury struggles in the lower single digits - hovering just above freezing in Scotland. Later in the week, temperatures will drop well below freezing in Scotland and northern England. Temperatures briefly touching  or  degrees in the afternoon and then going right back down again during the course of the evening, BBC meteorologist Tomasz Schafernaker said. Persistent rain is expected in the South East, with between mm and mm set to fall over two days.  Some parts of the UK could see sleet and snow, though it will largely stay on higher ground. Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said the South East could see some snow on Thursday and Friday, butit happens, it wonapost stay around for long. She added: We may see the odd flurry down to lower levels, particularly in the North East, maybe the North West depending on what day youaposre looking at, but certainly any snow to lower levels will be quite transient really and not last very long.  Meanwhile, meteorologists have observed a sudden stratospheric warming is under way, which is associated with very cold weather. Sudden stratospheric warming three years ago brought the heavy snow termed the Beast from the East. However, the Met Office said the event is more likely to bring more cold weather without heavy snow, though it is dficult to predict.  The agency is also tracking a La Nina in the Pacic, which could bring wet and stormy weather as it increases the UKaposs chances of westerly winds. Ms Maxey said: Youaposve got the two events happening at the same time so they vie against each other in a sense. Theyaposre sort of fighting for influence over the UK, weaposre a very small dot in the middle of the ocean. She added that the warming in the stratosphere takes at least  days to move down into our atmosphere. Ms Maxey continued: The feeling at the moment is that we may see some colder weather towards the end of January into February, but probably the sort of weather that weaposre seeing at the moment, as opposed to what is popularly perceived as a Beast from the East. Thereaposs still a lot to play for, weaposre keeping an eye on the situation, the experts are working on how that might influence our weather.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson made the announcement this evening, which will see tough new measures in place until the middle of February. It came as coronavirus hospital deaths rose to  today - the highest Monday increase since April- with , new infections. The tougher restrictions follow mounting pressure on the government after an increasing number of hospitals struggle to cope with the overwhelming amount of Covid- infections. The new lockdown will mean weddings are banned and will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances. The tough restrictions, which come into place at midnight, means thousands of couples who have either pinned their hopes for a wedding in the near future or had already been forced to postpone their nuptials must now reschedule yet again. Under the tighter rules exceptional circumstances would apply to a couple where one or both of them are terminally-ill. Funerals can be attended by a maximum of  people, just like Tier . But wakes can only be attended by up to six. The Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches national director John Stevens spoke out when a blanket ban was put on weddings across England in November. He said: In the context of Covid where people are dying and really struggling with mental health, cancelling a wedding might seem small by comparison. But the organisation that has gone into planning weddings and the financial cost... and itaposs actually a really serious issue particularly for couples who are Biblical believing Christians.

The decision on which alert level should be in place is made by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, which includes Chief Medical Officers of all four nations. The four Chief Medical Officers published a statement saying: Cases are rising almost everywhere, in much of the country driven by the new more transmissible iant. We are not confident that the NHS can handle a further sustained rise in cases and without further action there is a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next  days.The decision came before Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a national lockdown for England in a TV address on Monday evening. The lockdown comes into force later this week and tightens existing rules. What is Level   The Covid Alert Levels scale was announced by the Prime Minister back in May to help deal with the pandemic.Unveiling it, Mr Johnson said the level depends on the aposRapos rate - the number of people each Covid- carrier infects - and the number of coronavirus cases.He explained: In turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures. The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be. There are five levels on the scale. They are:  Level  - Coronavirus is no longer present in the UK - no social distancingLevel  - The number of cases and transmission are low - minimal social distancing Level  - The virus is in general circulation - social distancing relaxed Level  - A high or rising level of transmission - enforced social distancing Level  - A material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed - extremely strict social distancing The UK has been at Level  since September, but is now at the most severe Level . Is Level  the same as Tier   No. The tier system runs from - and is made up of rules which limit what people can do, however those rules are guided by the alert level.

He was usually always right about everything.“Listen,anybody stepped out of line he would come down on you like a ton of bricks.“But, as a group, we weren’t like that. We stuck together as players and we are still all mates.“Deep down, there was real respect for Jim because we, more than anybody, knew what a great manager he was.”Holt also highlighted how McLean even enlisted his we Doris to help build a family atmosphere at Tannadice.He said: “Doris would take our wives out for a meal every so often and they would all have a great time.“It was a lovely gesture and the players all appreciated it.“I know it was Jim’s idea and his way of bringing everyone closer together. He was also the one who footed the bill.”Holt recently visited Tannadice to view the tributes to McLean that have been left at the stadium.He added: “It was really nice to see how many people had taken the time to go down and pay their respects.”BLETHER: Dundee photo from archives featuring Jim McLean, Jocky Scott and Bobby Cox and more Sunday Welfare AFA memories\" title\"#BLETHER: Dundee photo from archives featuring Jim McLean, Jocky Scott and Bobby Cox and more Sunday Welfare AFA memories# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp jim-mclean-jocky-scott-bobby-cox-dundee-fc-united-blether-with-brown embed # secretzeTDQwVtq\" data-secret\"zeTDQwVtq\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\":This offer will auto-renew annually at the price of  ua.. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack-mf\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-mf\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":true,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack-mf\",\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-mf\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Funerals can be attended by up to  people, however only five attendees will be allowed at weddings and civil partnerships.Ms Sturgeon said there will be #signicantly increased pressure# on NHS Scotland in January due to the rise in cases and that the country needs to act #quickly and decisively#.She said the situation in Scotland is about four weeks behind London.Covid- cases have surged in Scotland in recent days.More to follow.The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Eveningfrom just £. a month.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\":This offer will auto-renew annually at the price of  ua.. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack-mf\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-mf\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":true,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack-mf\",\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-mf\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

who are in Level  # under close review.Ms Sturgeon said the decision # taken after an urgent Cabinet meeting this morning # had not been taken lightly, but described it as a race between the vaccination programme and the new strain of Covid, which has caused a spike in cases.The first minister said: #The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current Level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below one.“It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.“In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.”Scotland recorded , new coronavirus cases in the past  hours, down from , reported on Sunday.However, according to modelling by the Scottish Government, taking now action could result in Covid- capacity in hospitals being overrun within #three or four weeks#.Ms Sturgeon # who estimated Scotland#s cases are about four weeks behind London and the south-east of England # said: “We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.“But we must act quickly and decisively.#It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.”It is hoped that keeping schools closed to pupils will drive down transmission rates.Ms Sturgeon said the impact of the new iant of Covid- on young people was not yet clear.Ms Sturgeon said: “Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries, so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.“They remain our priority.”Schools and nurseries will remain open to the children of key workers and those classed as vulnerable.She added that work is being done to seeschool and childcare staff can be made a priority for vaccination.Meanwhile, those who are shielding have been told not to go into work.Dr Gregor Smith, Scotland#s chief medical officer, is currently writing to all those previously shielding to excuse them from work.Ms Sturgeon said: #If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.“The chief medical officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a fit note for those who need it.”She added that it is hoped that most vulnerable Scots and those over the age of  will have had their first dose of the Covid- vaccine by May.Ms Sturgeon said that it was with #real regret# that places of worship must close except for broadcasting a service, or for funerals, weddings or civil ceremonies.Funeral numbers will be restricted to , and wakes are no longer permitted.Weddings and civil ceremonies have been restricted to five people.The first minister used her parliamentary statement to remind people they should not be travelling between regions.#If you are in a Level  area you cannot leave other than for essential purposes, and you should stay as close to home as possible and away from crowded places,# she added.As part of the tightening up of essential services, ski centres must close.Urging people to follow the rules and take them #just as seriously# as last March, Ms Sturgeon said she knew the next few weeks will be #incredibly tough#.“I’m sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary,# she said.“The dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that they will pave the way to brighter days ahead.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes amiss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!First footingA tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. Therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.Live eventsThe events that Scotlandrsquos festive season is famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year.

Naturally, this would not be the last time an IndyRef would be brought up this year.On January , the UK confirmed its first two cases of Covid-.FebruaryBy February , the forthcoming coronavirus pandemic seemed a million miles away ndash with only three cases confirmed by this point.Attention instead was on Storm Ciara ndash a powerful and long-lived cyclone which battered parts of the country with gusts of up to mph.Flooding and heavy wind caused damage to buildings and train services, and on February , a -year-old man died after falling on icy surfaces and banging his head during the storm.Another major news story to unfold in the last year was surrounding former finance secretary Derek Mackay MSP.Once tipped to become the next First Minister, the Scottish Sun revealed the now shamed politician had been pestering a -year-old schoolboy on social media.The paper reported the -year-old MSP had contacted the boy out of the blue without knowing his age the previous August, then sent him  messages over six months.MarchThen came March ndash a month that can only be described as the month coronavirus pandemic really hit home in Scotland.On March , Scotland had its first confirmed case of the virus in the NHS Tayside, followed soon after by its first death on March .By March ,  cases had been confirmed in the country, with the virus clearly beginning to spread into other health boards.The inevitable news then came ndash with all pubs, cafes and restaurants being forced to close on March , before a nationwide lockdown on March .On the same day, Alex Salmond was cleared of sexually assaulting nine woman while he was the First Minister.As the BBC reports, a jury found the former SNP leader not guilty on  of the sexual assault charges facing him, while another was found not proven.A further charge of sexually assaulting a th woman had previously been dropped by prosecutors. Throughout the trial, Mr Salmond said he was innocent of all charges.On March , Clap For Carers was launched - coined up as a way to show appreciation for those on the NHS and other frontline services during the pandemic.The event saw people taking to their doorsteps and windows at pm every Thursday to clap, cheer, ring bells and play bagpipes to show their support.The last formal clap took place on May , followed by an extea Clap for NHS on July  marking the nd anniversary of its establishment.AprilOn April , the Queen made a rare broadcast to the UK and wider Commonwealth, in which she thanked people for following social distancing rules and said the UK ldquowill succeed in its fight against the coronavirus.Echoing the words of Vera Lynnrsquos wartime song, she added ldquoWe will meet again.On the same day, Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer Dt Catherine Calderwood resigned after facing intense criticism for breaking lockdown rules twice to visit her second home during the pandemic.Dr Calderwood concluded with the First Minister that her position was untenable given the need for consistent and trustworthy public health messaging.Sticking with the pandemic, all eyes were on -year-old war veteran Tom Moore on April , who raised millions of pounds for NHS charities for walking more than  laps of his garden.In less joyful news, just four days later on April , Scotlandrsquos new temporary coronavirus hospital the NHS Louisa Jordan opened to receive Covid patients.MayOn May , Boris Johnsonrsquos senior advisor Dominic Cummings faced calls to resign after an investigation alleged he travelled  miles from London to his parentrsquos home in Durham while displaying coronavirus symptoms during lockdown.On May , Cummings held a press conference in the Downing Street Rose Garden, in which he said: ldquoI donrsquot regret what I did.

UK citizens will be allowed to stay in the EU for  days in any -day period without a visa, and the same will apply for EU citizens in the UK.The European Commission says the choice to end free movement ldquoinevitably means that business travel between the EU and the UK will no longer be as easy as it currently is.People heading from the UK for business have been told by the Government to check the requirements of the country they are travelling to.British passport holders will no longer be able to use the EU passport queue at airports and other borders.Will I need a visa for my holiday From , you will have to purchase a pound visa-waiver for holidays and short stays.UK nationals will not need a visa for short trips to EU countries theyre just going on holiday.But they will have to pay for a visa-waiver ndash this will cost euroand will be issued under the European Travel Information and Authorisation System.Can I work in the EU From  onwards you may need extra documents to work or study, or for trips longer than  days.Details of this have yet to be confirmed and it will likely depend on what you are doing and where you are going.But those going to work or study abroad, plus those just going on business trips, might be affected from January , , onwards.Will I need a blue passport No, your current passport is still eligible.Pre-Brexit, you could travel to EU countries on your passport right up to the point it expires ndash and that willcontinueto be the case this year, and will be until the end of the transition period on December .However, next year, the rules are changing.These changes were announced prior to the trade deal and arent expected to be affected by it.Under the new rules, fromJanuary , , when you visit most EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, your passport will need to have at least six months left on it until expiry and be less than ten years old on the day you travel.Will security change The UK will lose access to a iety of key EU databases - used by the police- covering things such as criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons.However, the UK will still have access to other systems which include cross-checks on fingerprints across Europe. This means that security co-operation will no longer be on ldquoreal-time access.The UK and the EU have reached an agreement on extradition, and the UKs role in Europol, the cross-border security agency, allows it to sit in on meetings but not have a direct say in decisions.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"absolutely confident\" the deal \"protects our police co-operation, protects our ability to catch criminals and to share intelligence across the European continent in the way that we have done for many years\".What about fishing The value of fish being caught by the EU in UK waters will be reduced by % and will be phased into transition over a five-and-a-half-year period.Once the transition period is over, the UK will fully control access to its waters and could make much deeper cuts.What is the impact on EU citizens living in the UK While Brexit affects everyone in the UK, the most immediate direct impact is on the . million people living here who are citizens of other EU countries.If you are a European Economic Area or Swiss citizen living in Britain, you wont have to leave the UK because weve left the EU.

household and exercising.The number of times you can exercise is not limited, although group exercise is banned.The \"stay at home\" message will be backed up by law, starting from tomorrow .The First

Ms Sturgeon said the new iant accounts for almost half of all new cases in the country.\"It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned now than I have been at any time since March,\" said Ms Sturgeon.Schools will now stay closed for a further two weeks until February  - with plans to reopen on January  scrapped.The new lockdown means that outdoor gatherings are limited to two people from two dferent households.Anyone  or under will not be counted towards that number.Travel restrictions remain in place, with cross-border journeys banned unless essential.Places of worship will have to close again.Ms Sturgeon said that the new measures would not be \"in place any longer than necessary\", but warned that the lockdown could continue past February .The First Minister added that the Borders is currently at more than % of its COVID hospital capacity."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeons-coronavirus-announcement-full-lockdown-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scotland will enter a national lockdown.As of midnight tonight, it will now be a legal requirement for people to stay at home unless for essential travel.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.\"The First Minister added: \"Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.\"The decisioncomes as cases of Covid- have dramatically risen across the country, with, new positive cases announced today.Heres the key points from todays announcement:Stay at home messageFrom tomorrow,you live in a Level  areayou cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose - much like back in March.This means when you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Schools will stay closedNicola Sturgeon confirmed that schools will stay closed until February  for the majority of pupils.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.\"The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.\"We, therefore, have to adopt a cautious approach.\"So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.\"This decision will be reviewed on January  whether they canto school on February .Meeting people outdoorsFrom tomorrow,the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.Previously, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Working from homeAnyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Shielding advice changesIf you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Hospitals near capacityNicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to twoweeks ago.Other restrictions will also come into effect includingplaces of worship closing,no wakes, two-metre distancing in canteens and further premises closing.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.What help will be provided Grants areavailable for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions.

Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package.

New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!A tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7067548.jpg?htype=16\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"Here we look at some of the businesses who will no longer be operating in the city and the ones under threat.Remnant KingsCity location: Howard StreetA total of  stafflost their jobs from the firmrsquos bases in Glasgow, Hamilton, and Edinburgh after the administrators were called in.The firm, which started in Glasgow in , said that although they were historically profitable, they have since suffered from declining turnover and trading dficulties in recent years caused by changing consumer habits.:Glasgow firm Remnant Kings goes into admistration resulting in job lossesOasis and Warehouse GroupCity locations past and present: Buchanan Galleries, Silverburn, Princes Square, and Glasgow Fort.The company behind Oasis and Warehouse went into administration in April when Deloitte was appointed as administrator.All stores haveclosed indefinitely whileonline sales have stopped.Reports say the fashion brands have been sold to restructuring business Hilco in a deal which includes stock but not the  stores or  concessions.Hash Ladha, chief executive of Oasis Warehouse, previouslysaid: ldquoThis is a situation that none of us could have predicted a month ago, and comes as shocking and dficult news for all of us.ldquoWe as a management team have done everything we can to try and save the iconic brands that we love.:Oasis and Warehouse who have shops in Glasgow fall into administrationCath KidstonCity location: Gordon StreetCath Kidston said they will not reopen their shops when lockdown ends.They called in the administrators in April with the closure of shops costing around  jobs.It is understood that the owner of the retro fashion brand has secured a deal to buy back the brand and its online operation.

The value of spending time with, and giving support to families, friends and neighbours has hit home for many, as has a renewed recognition of the wider degree to which we are all dependent on many others.That is a reminder, too, of our continuing responsibility to protect others by following the rules. It is likely to be months yet before a degree of normality s. Adjustments to how and where we work and the ways in which we interact with others will be required.In the wider public sphere, the past year has been a salutary lesson in the importance of transparency, clarity and consistency from those to whom we lend our trust to exercise authority. That has too often been a deficiency over the course of this disease, and it has unnecessarily compounded the dficulties of dealing effectively with it.It is not merely that, with hindsight, it is possible to identy catastrophic decisions, such as the release of patients into care homes without testing. We accept that the governments in Holyrood and at Westminster were dealing with an unprecedented situation and that mistakes were inevitable while much was unknown. It is also clear that ndash whatever criticisms there are to be made about the handling of the crisis ndash politicians demonstrated unanimity in declaring that their policies would be made on pragmatic grounds, in line with expert advice.But that sincerity of intent, alas, was not always translated into effective messaging. It is precisely when a number of approaches are possible, and when there is conflicting advice, that it is inadequate merely to assure the public that policy is ldquofollowing the science. The rationale, the projections and, wherever possible, the data behind decisions needs also to be transmitted in a clear fashion.For all the slide presentations and daily press conferences, there was far too much confusion. The pretence that tiers in dferent nations, ldquocircuit-breaking lockdowns, and other measures were substantially dferent from earlier restrictions may have been designed to reassure, or to suit the rules to local conditions.But in the end, it proved at best a recipe for confusion at a time when people were already inclined to chafe at continued privations. At worst, it gave some an excuse for deliberately misunderstanding the rules, as did occasions when politicians and officials north and south of the Border failed to observe rules that they themselves had imposed.Even with the realistic prospect that vaccination will halt or signicantly reduce the lethal damage that Covid has wrought, these issues will remain major challenges for government in the months, and probably for years, to come. Other areas, such as the enormous economic cost, will need to be addressed, in the words of the hymnrsquos later verse, ldquofree from error and hypocrisy.The decision of the SNP at Westminster to vote against a Brexit deal, having endlessly argued that any deal was better than none, is an example of the sort of petty partisan point-scoring that undermines efforts to rebuild. That is a shame, when the national interest ndash for nationalists and unionists alike ndash is at stake. The huge task of supporting the recovery of business, education and other fields must not be marked by the dither, delay and opacity that marked too many decisions last year, nor manipulated for party advantage. A New Year, a new start."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Can Nicola Sturgeon finally deliver an independence referendum in 2021 ","story":"After the Brexit referendum ldquochanged material circumstances and, in Nicola Sturgeonrsquos view, rendered the  independence referendum null and void, wersquove had a series of forecasts of a rerun. ldquoI am determined, she told the SNP conference in October , ldquothat Scotland will have the ability to reconsider the question of independence and do so before the UK leaves the EU. She then published a new Independence Referendum Bill.In March , the day before Article  on leaving the EU was passed by Parliament, the First Minister formally requested the consent of Westminster to hold a referendum on Scottish independence. Theresa May said: ldquonow is not the time. The SNP lost a third of its seats in the  snap election that followed.Undaunted, she unveiled a ldquoreset timetable for indyref  which was now scheduled for the autumn of . When that didnrsquot happen she moved the dial to the autumn of , but before that date the SNP switched to supporting a Peoplersquos Vote for Brexit instead of indyref. That didnrsquot happen either. Indeed, the Peoplersquos Vote turned into a Tory General Election landslide of December . A triumphant Boris Johnson announced that he was now Minister for the Union and would reject a Scottish independence referendum for ldquoa generation.Sturgeonrsquos latest forecast is for a referendum in the first half of the new Scottish parliamentary cycle ndash meaning sometime around . You might think that after all these  dawns, independence supporters would have lost hope ndash but not a bit of it. After every deadline has been missed, support for independence has eventually ticked up.More voters than ever appear to have been convinced that Scotland should be an independent country. Some  polls have shown a majority for Yes, reaching a peak of  per cent in a Savanta ComRes poll in mid-December.Of course, that poll excluded donrsquot knows, and all recent polls have been conducted under the shadow of Brexit and latterly the pandemic. It is dficult to know just how much of this is actual support for independence and how much is down to loathing of Boris Johnson and Brexit. However, any objective assessment of the polling evidence would have to conclude that independence is gradually becoming the settled will of the Scottish electorate.This doesnrsquot mean a referendum is in the bag or even that it will certainly take place. Personally, I think the odds of a legally-binding referendum being held in the next decade are fairly remote. This is because the Conservatives now have a very solid majority in Westminster, despite losing a raft of Scottish MPs in .Boris Johnson is triumphant after his Brexit deal and will argue that there is no justication for holding a ldquoisive referendum to break up Britain at the very moment the UK is going through the complex process of rebuilding after the twin shocks of Covid and Brexit.The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, is also of this view. He is promising further devolution instead of a referendum and has enlisted one of the stars of the  Better Together campaign, the former PM Gordon Brown, to front it. That is the surest sign that, unlike Jeremy Corbyn, Starmer is not prepared to flirt with independence.So, eventhe SNP win the expected landslide in the May Scottish elections, the prospect of Westminster agreeing a legally binding referendum on Scottish independence is remote.Nor will there be much enthusiasm in Brussels for Scottish secession, now that a Brexit deal is in place. Those politicians in the European Parliament who had been saying theyrsquod changed their minds about Scottish independence were mostly playing a tactical game to discredit Brexit. Countries like France and Spain are as resolutely opposed to ldquoseparatism as ever, and are not going to allow Brussels to get involved in the internal politics of a country no longer in the European Union.Nicola Sturgeon has always said that the independence referendum has to be ldquobeyond legal challenge ndash in other words, expressly authorised by Westminster through a Section  Order.She is not interested in declaring UDI after a General Election victory or staging a wildcat referendum of the kind held by Catalonia in . That led to the incarceration of many of the referendum organisers and the self-exile of the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont.The First Minister is the queen of caution. But that doesnrsquot mean shersquoll do nothing. Her personal popularity has never been higher following her handling of the pandemic, and the SNP has a commanding lead in the opinion polls. The FM is fully aware of just how dficult it is to win an absolute majority in a proportional parliament.But she will probably secure the support of the Greens at Holyrood for a referendum.So what happens then  Joanna Cherry MP, one of the stars of the anti-Brexit court actions, hopes that she will take on the Westminster Government in the Supreme Court,Boris refuses to accept the Scottish Governmentrsquos ldquomandate for a referendum.It is clear, under the UK constitution, that Holyrood has no power to hold a legally binding referendum on independence, but that doesnrsquot mean it canrsquot hold a consultative or advisory ballot asking the Scottish people what they want.There is a chance that the courts would agree that Holyrood has the power to hold a nationwide opinion poll.But would that make any dference  The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, is promising to boycott any such advisory referendum and is calling on Unionists not to participate in it. Even some supporters of independence might think that now is just the wrong time to be holding a isive referendum. It could lead to a repeat of the Catalan situation in  when their referendum was condemned as unrepresentative because unionist voters refused to vote.Nationalists might say: a votersquos a vote andpeople donrsquot take the opportunity of expressing a view they canrsquot complain about the result.But it is not Holyrood they need to convince but Westminster. Boris Johnson would use a half-baked referendum result to rule out a referendum even more emphatically than before, and Keir Starmer would back him.We are in a strange limbo, therefore. There is no obvious reason to expect a Scottish referendum in the near future and yet almost everyone does. There is no politically plausible route. However, politics is very fluid right now. We live in turbulent times.Support is clearly rising and it may be that a mass movement of Scottish opinion exerts moral pressure on the Westminster establishment to change its mind. But in the meantime, itrsquos business as usual. Scotland will just have to fake it till she makes it."},{"url":null,"title":"politics-independence-unionists-run-road","story":"Irsquom not one for living by the words of Vladimir Lenin, but they do feel particularly appropriate for our times. The approval of the UKrsquos most voluminous vaccine, aimed at ending the once-in-a-century pandemic, followed hot on the heels of the approval of the trade and security deal struck between the European Union and its first ever departing member, the UK.We live in historically signicant times. However, momentous as both of those events may be, we are about to face a larger one. It may seem counterintuitive ndash hyperbolic even ndash to suggest that the Scottish Parliament elections in four months time carry the same level of importance as coronavirus and Brexit, but they do.In fact, they are more important, and may have more enduring consequences than both. Thursday th May will either be the last election to a devolved Scottish Parliament before Scotland becomes independent, or it will be the last election to a devolved Scottish Parliament where independence is a signicant issue at the ballot box.This is the end game ndash a political title-decider. The field of play looks unremittingly bleak for Scotlandrsquos unionists. That assessment is not based solely on the headline polling numbers, grim as they are .It is what lies beneath that should worry unionists most. In the first referendum, in , the No vote relied on those with good jobs, good prospects and some money in the bank. Not so now Yes has a handsome lead over No in the ABC social class groupings, according to all pollsters.Gender has historically played a role in independence voting intentions, with women thought to be more risk-averse, and tending towards a No vote. No more women now lead with every pollster, in some cases by double-digits.The age profile of No voters is one of those ldquolook away now moments for unionists No leads only in the age group nearing retirement or older. Less than one-in-five under s will vote No. Should the referendum take place in , for the sake of argument, those aged six at the  referendum will be eligible to vote. Current patterns suggest almost all of them will vote Yes.There is no inevitability about this, though. The situation has arisen, in my opinion, largely as a result of push-factors rather than pull-factors. In other words, some of those who would previously have voted No have switched to Yes because of negativity towards the UK rather than positivity towards Scotland.Brexit  Boris  Covid  Probably all three, and probably a whole lot of other reasons. It is important. Many potential Yes voters are not emotional nationalists rather, they are pragmatically and clinically assessing le in an independent Scotland as being, on balance, better than le in the UK.He or she who is pushed away can be pulled back. But it will require the UK Government and its ruling Tories to make a series of radical changes which they have thus far shown themselves unwilling to do, or unable to do, or perhaps both.Truthfully, I donrsquot knowthey have it in them. I read an article at the weekend on a prominent Conservative blog in which the writer surmised that Scottish MPs could be made to like being at Westminster so much that independence could be stopped in its tracks. It was yet another ldquoDo these guys have any idea  moments, of which I experience many.There is a dference between unionist leaders and nationalist leaders. Nationalist leaders, unlike their foot soldiers, are clinical rather than emotional. They make decisions and create policy which they may personally find unpalatable, and which their supporters certainly do, because they know it will help them win Unionist leaders, on the other hand, are as emotional as the foot soldiers. They spend their time bleating about lsquoour precious Unionrsquo and concocting ious plans for how a referendum can be avoided that they never ask themselves the question: how are we going to win If they ever get around to doing so, they will understand that the answer is: by doing things we donrsquot like.The central tenet of what should become the new  of the UK Government is a great programme of decentralisation. They can call it what they wish ndash home rule, federalism, devo max, devo plus. Thatrsquos a job for the advertising agency. What matters is what it means.It means that people in Scotland are no longer forced into a binary choice of being a nationalist or a unionist. I donrsquot identy as either, and Irsquod bet the house that I am not alone.It means that Scots can choose the future that, until not so long ago, polling identied was the one they preferred ndash running almost all of their own affairs but within the context of a more powerful, but looser, UK.It means that the problems which have scarred Scottish devolution will not be experienced in the other parts of the UK, which are on the same journey, but further behind.And it means that, for perhaps the first time since devolution, unionists will hand nationalists a poisoned chalice rather than a golden ticket.They donrsquot have to like it. But they do have to do it. The unionists, after all these years of applying sticking plasters to compound fractures, have run out of road.bull Andy Maciver is Director of Message MattersOur columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"david-tennant-michael-sheen-staged-bbc1-series-two-episode-one","story":"BBC iPlayer****SOME endeavours lend themselves more naturally than others to the lockdown television format.If, say, the production of The Herald were to be given the Staged treatment, in the manner of David Tennant and Michael Sheenrsquos summer hit, the viewer would see little but a string of smoothly executed Zoom meetings in which beautul people put best laid plans into action, and nothing silly ever happened like a dog barking, or the features editor accidentally muting themselves for the umpteenth time.

An odd question, seeing that he immediately grants that this is fact, but then says this doesnt mean we need a unique political system, because we are largely the same as our neighbours. Let me offer him a way to resolve this contradiction. We are similar to, but not the same as, our neighbours. Many of us believe that the UKrsquos political system is working very badly and needs profound change. So wersquod rather choose our own.He next asks why she says the majority of Scots now support independence. Because opinion polls very consistently show more people support it than oppose it.

She contrasted the values behind Brexit with the collective spirit behind the collaborative international development of vaccines, a very dferent thing. This was a blatant twist of her words.Mr Smithrsquos Question  is about why Ms Sturgeon is not comfortable with a federal UK. I donrsquot know where this question comes from. She didnrsquot mention federalism at all in her article. If Mr Smith would like arguments against the federal idea, I could refer him to countless articles over recent years. Among the many convincing points they make, here are two: in a federal UK, Scotland wouldnrsquot control its own economy and on all major issues England would call all the shots.Last question: Why is she still calling this a ldquohard Brexit  Answer: Because it is. It is, because the UK Prime Minister was too weak to negotiate for any compromise for fear of his feral pack of Tory Brexiter extremists. I am sure the great majority of Leave voters ndash whose opinions I respect, though dfer from ndash would have been happy with a far greater degree of accommodation with the EU, but Mr Johnsons leadership vacuum didnt allow him to seek it.

Indeed, in the run-up to the independence referendum in , similar claims made by Alex Salmond were very quickly countered by Juan Manuel Barroso, the then President of the European Commission.Michel Barnier has apparently made it very clear that it will take a long time before Scotland will gain access to the EU. Spain will almost certainly veto any such application lest it boost Catalonias independence expectations.Ms Sturgeon has yet to confirm whether Scotland,pressed, will join the euro.

Standards of care y too much and are probably not regulated enough. Unfortunately, being a member of the human race may entail becoming sick, old, frail and perhaps demented. The least we should expect is to provide the elderly with care, love and dignity and that onus falls on all of us. We strive and mostly succeed to provide it for our children, so what about our old people  They should not matter less.He is correct ndash we need the provision of care to be brought under the NHS with much more rigorous monitoring and where people come before profit.

In , to mark the th anniversary of the battle, Charles Dorville Pilkington Jacksons statue of Bruce was put in place and the same year saw the construction of the Rotunda. By this point, there were only two Borestone fragments remaining and they were removed and placed inside the new visitor centre for safe-keeping.In his online article, Mr Welsh highlights an account by a Robert White who saw the stone in  when he said it had been chipped around on every side by souvenir hunters and described its colour as blue, while an account in John Parkerrsquos  book ldquoHistoric Tales of the Wars of Scotland, Volume Two described it as a large piece of granite.Mr Parker wrote: ldquoThe stone bears the marks of many a ruthless pilgrimage, and in many parts it has been chipped off by thousands of persons who wanted to possess a piece of the relic.Meanwhile, in an account in , documented in a letter published in ious Scottish newspapers, a William Ireland wrote that he had visited the stone and many pieces were still being taken.He wrote that it was ldquogreenstone, or some similar igneous rock capable of taking a high polish. Ireland wrote of the souvenir hunters in the hope it would alert Scots to do something about it and protect the stone from trophy hunters.Mr Welsh said that letters were then sent in response to Mr Irelandrsquos words, explaining: ldquoOne correspondent didnrsquot think bits were being taken away as much as implied. All the communications demanded something be done about it and they blamed the landowner and the locals for the state of neglect. The enclosure subsequently rested on a concrete base. The fragments were put in a new location on a pedestal in , but they subsequently disappeared.The keen historian, who said he put his online post up ldquoto get some discussion going, added: ldquoIt has since been suggested that the Borestone was merely an old millstone put there early in the th century to give credence to tradition. The stone pieces appear slab like and cream-coloured.ldquoSo who is right  In the mid-th century it was an igneous rock either blue or with a greenish glossy appearance, whereas today it is just two bits of an old millstone.Derek Alexander, Head of Archaeology at the National Trust for Scotland said he welcomes ldquodebates like this as they inspire us to ldquostay curious and keep digging into the past.Mr Alexander said: ldquoThe Trust also has questions about the fragments of the Borestone that are currently held onsite at Bannockburn.ldquoWhile detailed research was carried out as part of the project to revamp the visitor centre in , record-keeping in the s was not at the standard it is now, so it is very dficult to trace the story with certainty.ldquoWe would be interested in any information anyone could share about the stone, especially around an alleged theft in the s.He added: ldquoThe fact that debates like this and new questions pop up all the time is one of the best things about Scotlandrsquos heritage.ldquoIt encourages us to stay curious, keep digging and discovering more about our history."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12195641.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nick-rodger-jam-packed-year-hopefully-plenty-store-golf","story":"If  was an annus horribilis, then  could yet be an annus equally-bloody-awfulis.

We regret that there will be no indoor waiting or toilet facilities at Gills Bay during the closure.“We are hopeful that by making these short-term business alterations now, we can safeguard the business through the coming months, and be ready to welcome passengers back on board safely, when conditions allow.“We would like to thank everyone for their support during this incredibly dficult time and very much look forward to welcoming you back to our service during the better months to come.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although transfer tests start this weekend, no announcement was made on Monday night.With all non-essential retail already closed, and ato school for thousands of children delayed, the Executive’s lockdown options are limited.The most recent plan was for primary pupils to be taught remotely for the week from January -, while for secondary school Years  to , remote learning is due to last for the entire month. Sources on Monday night indicated there would be an extended period of remote learning until February.Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said Health Minister Robin Swann and Education Minister Peter Weir would bring recommendations to an Executive meeting today about exams.Earlier, First Minister Arlene Foster had hinted at such a move.“If it’s the case that we need to close schools as we did in March last year I will deeply regret that,” she said. “But we will of course take whatever action is needed based on the medical evidence in front of us.”Boris Johnson’s announcement that pushing ahead with all exams in England this summer “as normal” would not be fair or possible also puts pressure on Mr Weir to postpone this weekend’s first transfer test for pupils hoping to attend grammar schools in Northern Ireland.Mrs O’Neill on Monday called for it to be abandoned. “The transfer tests should not proceed,” the Sinn Fein vice president said. “The Education Minister needs to act now.”It is understood that the two exams bodies that run the tests will make announcements on Tuesday. Mrs Foster said they were private bodies that make their own decisions, but will have to abide by health advice.Schools had already been advised by Mr Weir to have contingency plans ready should there be a need to cancel the tests.A Department of Education spokesperson said: “The minister has highlighted the need to ensure that all schools hosting the tests have carried out a full risk assessment and that the arrangements for the tests are compatible with public health guidance and public health legislation.“The minister has stressed that there cannot be any compromise to ensuring the safety of children and families.”But the Department added: “The minister has also highlighted the need for schools to ensure that contingency admissions criteria are in place in the event that entrance tests cannot be operated.”After his announcement on Monday night, the Prime Minister said the Government had been doing “everything in our power to keep schools open”.“The problem is not that schools are unsafe for children,” he said, adding that children are still very unlikely to be severely affected even by the new iant of Covid. But he said schools may act as “vectors for transmission”, causing the virus to spread.He added that all the devolved nations share his thoughts, and are taking similar steps.SDLP education spokesman Daniel McCrossan has now called on Mr Weir to follow suit.“The Prime Minister announced that all GCSE and A-Level exams have been cancelled in England,” he said.“It’s time Peter Weir made the same announcement and cancelled exams and the transfer test. The SDLP have been calling for exams to be cancelled for months. The minister must act.”Public sector union Nipsa last night called on Mr Weir to close schools “until they are safe”.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"VideoCoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Extended period of remote learning for schoolsThere will be an extended period of remote learning for schools in Northern Ireland, the Executive has said.

He hopes to be finished by the end of March.He swims mostly in the evening and some mornings - but while it is not always pitch black, he says he is now used to the limited vision when swimming at night.There are waves breaking and they leave a white froth that is a bit like a guide light. My sight is impaired slightly in the water and my other senses come into play, he explained.At the start I was intimidated by the darkness, but it was almost as soon as I accepted this is the way it is, the other senses picked up. I got far more comfortable and now I just go in and I#m completely at ease.Al counteracts the cold by making sure he is equipped with the right gear but says the worst thing is the wind chill.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseHelp: surfer Al Mennie has been swimming at night for charity FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHelp: surfer Al Mennie has been swimming at night for charity However, one of the biggest concerns with swimming in the dark is being unable to see what is below or around you.He added: I#ve been a bit concerned in the darkI did come across something orsomething came across me what would happen!With every stroke you feel seaweed or dferent things in the water and it#s a bit like #what#s in there #One night I#m pretty sure a fish hit me in the leg and another one on the side and I saw a dead seal pup and a live one as well.You are in the water and you don#t see anything and when something hits you it#s quite a shock, you don#t know what it is - of course it#s that unknown factor of being in the dark and not knowing what is there.Al says another factor is the pollution brought in the water with the heavy north winds.He added: The heavy north winds bring in anything that#s been in the river or pollution and stuff like that.I want to do it over a sustained period of time so I can#t afford to get sick in any way so I choose not to swim when that potential pollution is brought in along with the rubbish.Explaining where he finds the motivation to go out in the dark and the cold, Al says it is mind over matter.But it is raising awareness of depression and the help that is available for anyone struggling to keep their head above water in the darkest times that is his main driving force.Across the board there is a decline in people#s mental health in general, he added.People can find themselves in this place and don#t know how they got there.And Aware NI do sessions for people who are vulnerable on their own or isolated.He added: There isn#t as much money at the minute, charities are struggling for support as donations have dropped. I might raise a little bit of money but through doing this challenge I#m pairing the dferent things together.I tried to make this so that it also inspires people to go outdoors more and get some fresh air.My key objective is to try and promote something to help iniduals find their way through the darkness instead of struggling and feeling like they are on their own.To find out more visit https:www.swimthroughdarkness Belfast Most ReadSammy Wilson defends Portrush visit after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Extended period of remote learning for schoolsBelfast woman Lucy McIlhatton killed in Springfield Road crashLegal loophole lets , speeders in Northern Ireland escape punishmentHow Co Down couple breathed new le into historic #Frankenstein house# Castle WardLatest HealthCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Clarity expected on tougher restrictionsNorthern Ireland facing new Covid curbs after England goes into lockdownDelays in treatment for stroke patients in Northern Ireland blamed on Covid pandemicRalph HewittOpinionCovid  #banquet of consequences# we warned about being served upPortrush and Portstewart crowds forced us to look at tougher Covid rules, warns Arlene FosterLatest from Belfast Patrick ’GormanOpinionReimagining the city centres of the futureNorthern Ireland grocers remain #well prepared# Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Clarity expected on tougher restrictionsRevival of Co Down industrial site revampMilestone: , Co-Ownership homes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And there were sightings of a iety of Easter treats where, as marketeers muscle in four months ahead of the event.Social media users have been posting pictures of chocolate eggs on the shelves of a number of supermarkets , with many commenting on how quickly they had appeared. On December , one person wrote on Twitter: I saw Easter eggs in store yesterday.

On the date she was detected speeding, May  of last year, the defendant already had nine penalty points on her licence.Mr Jack said his client now faced the possibility of being disqualied for six months. She is a nurse in the Covid ward in the Causeway Hospital, he said. On the date in question she was feeling unwell and went to Altnagelvin Hospital for a Covid test. Unfortunately the test proved to be positive and after receiving the result she became distracted when driving home and exceeded the speed limit.I spoke to the PPS and explained the background to them and askedthey could mark it by way of a caution rather than by proceeding with the case.But I was told the case had been allocated to a prosecutor and nothing could be done. I am concerned thatshe receives a y disqualication today that she will have dficulty in getting to and from her work.The judge said she would deal with the matter by way of a short disqualication today and disqualied the defendant from driving for three days and fined her £.Belfast Most ReadSammy Wilson defends Portrush visit after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Extended period of remote learning for schoolsBelfast woman Lucy McIlhatton killed in Springfield Road crashLegal loophole lets , speeders in Northern Ireland escape punishmentHow Co Down couple breathed new le into historic #Frankenstein house# Castle WardLatest Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Clarity expected on tougher restrictionsNorthern Ireland facing new Covid curbs after England goes into lockdownCampaign highlights brutal impact of #paramilitary attacks#Sarah Brett: The job I always wanted was Good Morning Ulster, I really missed homeDelays in treatment for stroke patients in Northern Ireland blamed on Covid pandemicLatest from Belfast Revival of Co Down industrial site revampMilestone: , Co-Ownership homesRichard KyleOpinionWhy Northern Ireland can remain fertile ground for private equityNorthern Ireland facing new Covid curbs after England goes into lockdownNext sees better-than-expected festive sales, but cautions over lockdown hit,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After the most dficult of  months, Jon Tonge rates our ministers.Arlene Foster: First MinisterThis was the First Minister#s best year in a while, although that may damn with faint praise.Mrs Foster got her job back, devolution was restored, she sailed through the RHI inquiry report and earned praise even beyond her community for Covid consistency.Then her party bizarrely forced a cross-community vote against lockdown before agreeing to tougher restrictions within a fortnight. That at least united lockdown zealots and sceptics in anger and bafflement.Brexit yielded an Irish Sea border, and many blamed the DUP as midwives of their misfortune.Arlene nonetheless celebrated five years as DUP leader, most spent not dealing with Sammy Wilson or Edwin Poots.She was also confronted by the biggest rebellion in DUP history as  MLAs refused to support their leader on the Executive Functions Bill.Yet all the endless talk of leadership challenges remains just that - chatter. Foster remains the undisputed leader of unionism as her beloved country enters its centenary. Michelle O#Neill: Deputy First MinisterPaid a price for attending what seems the longest funeral in history, given the arguments it still attracts.Having survived a curious party leadership challenge from John O#Dowd in , the Deputy First Minister began the year promisingly. Sinn Fein#s quiet compromise on a standalone Irish Language Act helped facilitate New Decade, New Approach and theof Stormont.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMichelle O#NeillPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMichelle O#Neill Via existing legislation, Irish language provision was to be extended and a dedicated commissioner appointedO#Neill#s party got most of what it wanted, on terms nonetheless acceptable to the DUP. O#Neill#s pronouncements on the need for an all-island strategy to deal with Covid made good sense. But at the end of June came that funeral furore. This extended even beyond those whose views on republican commitments to public safety were shaped by an earlier era.We did not really miss the joint briefings from the First and Deputy First Minister. Loveless marriages on public show are not a great watch. But their absence symbolised the void in joined-up government. And no one was surprised when Michelle found  reasons why she was unable to attend Arlene#s big centenary party next year.For the Deputy First Minister, the hope is to seize the main office in . Sinn Fein#s strong performances in the South increase expectations, and pressure, on its northern leader. Robin Swann: HealthThe lockdown king had a strong year, commanding respect across the political spectrum. LucidTalk surveys showed most of the public backed tough Covid restrictions. Swann immunised Northern Ireland from the wildlyoptimisticus virus strain offered by the Prime Minister.The Health Minister must have had moments of regret at choosing the one job more taxing than his former role leading the UUP. Still, such experience helped with the crisis management.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRobin SwannMichael Cooper FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueRobin Swann Northern Ireland#s NHS crisis long pre-dated Covid, shocking testimony to the three-year absence of devolved government. Swann helped prevent total collapse and quickly settled the health workers# strike.Critics suggested Swann was optimism#s antidote. They criticised his early warning that , might die as alarmist, % beyond the actual toll. There remained concern over whether the Covid focus was at the expense of other treatments. Businesses raged against stop-start lockdowns. Van Morrison declined the invitation to the Swann Christmas household bubble. Ironically, Swann ended the year being criticised for being too soft in not imposing a travel ban from Britain.But overall, no one could accuse Swann of swerving science or ducking extraordinarily dficult challenges. Edwin Poots: AgricultureAppeared at times a masked version of Sammy Wilson in terms of lockdown scepticism and leadership challenges.In an extraordinary scientic breakthrough in October, Poots seemed to discover a mutant strain of the virus in which transmission in nationalist areas exceeded that in unionist communities by six to one.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEdwin Poots FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueEdwin Poots When sticking to his agriculture brief, Poots is well regarded as a capable and often conciliatory minister who listens and engages. The DUP old-school veteran is on top of the issues and commands the respect of the farmers and the community he serves.Whatever Poots# aversion to some aspects of lockdown, there were no rule breaches amid the grief of the funeral of his father earlier this year.Ended a dficult year testing positive for Covid-. Peter Weir: EducationSometimes seemed so keen on keeping children in school at all costs you half-expected them to be in class on Christmas Day morning. But it#s a strange world when an Education Minister - or Under-fire Education Minister, to give Peter Weir his full title for most of the year - gets criticised for wanting children to go to school.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePeter Weir FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePeter Weir Arguments over transfer test locations at least deflectedfrom the age-old battle about the tests themselves. Public opinion is evenly ided. Those whose kids are most likely to pass are most in favour of the tests, funnily enough. Such arguments will persist long beyond the DUP minister#s tenure.An Arlene loyalist, Weir deserves credit for wanting to keep education as normal as possible. He recognised that remote learning experiences y wildly and disadvantage most those in greatest need. Nonetheless, January classes in school look unlikely. Expect his decision to persist, with some GCSE and A-level examinations next summer to come under further pressure. Another climbdown seems likely. Nichola Mallon: InfrastructureThis ought to be one of the more attractive Executive posts, allowing strategic development. Yet the Covid grimness was so all-consuming that Mallon#s job became simply keeping the show on the road - literally in terms of transport services.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNichola Mallon FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNichola Mallon The SDLP#s solitary Executive presence, Mallon did good work in terms of liaising with those services andkeeping airports alive, but some taxi outfits remain close to collapse, even with rescue packages. Greener bus orders and Casement Park renewal were rare decisions beyond the crisis management. Naomi Long: JusticeNormally one of the adults in the room. Helped broker dficult Executive compromises on lockdown. A decade after policing and justice were devolved, the Alliance leader found herself dealing with a wide range of issues, ranging from Covid prison outbreaks to Gerry Kelly#s tweets.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNaomi LongPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNaomi Long After a mainly sure-footed stint, Long found herself embroiled in end-of-year rows over the funding of payments to Troubles victims and delays to much-needed reform of domestic abuse law.In party leadership terms, it was understandably a quieter year, obviously overshadowed by Covid and the absence of elections, after last year#s spectacular advances for Long#s party. Diane Dodds: EconomyAttempted valiantly to keep alive an economy potentially suffering more damage from lockdowns than  years of the Troubles. Appeared to be on a Save Ulster from Sobriety mission with a determined campaign to keep open hospitality.The Democratic Unionist Pubs advocate spent much of the year arguing against prohibition and those believing that requiring the purchase of chips with a pint warded off a virus.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDiane Dodds FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDiane Dodds By December, though, even Dodds seemed resigned to a lack of festive cheer, although she did get a retail voucher scheme approved to try and help beleaguered shops.The mass unemployment coming post-furlough will not be her fault..

It#s had superb presenters down through the years and is a massive honour. I thought I was ready for it.Nevertheless, she has high hopes of hitting Belfast in the spring - when, for the first time, she will join sidekick Chris Bucklerand the rest of the GMU team in its Ormeau Avenue studio - over a year since she first got the job.Chris and I haven#t actually seen each other since the interview process, which was at the end of December , Sarah revealed.Much as I#d had a great time on BBC Radio  Live, I#d been looking to come back to Northern Ireland for a while. I always missed home.My mum and dad were getting to an age where they were going to need me around a bit more often.Going through the interview process, Sarah said she was very pleased to see that Chris was one of the people in the frame for it.She added that the pair, who front GMU together three days a week - she does Monday to Thursday, while he covers Tuesday to Friday - didn#t actually know each other, although she was aware of Buckler#s work, which included a two-year stint in the US as BBC#s Washington Correspondent.With a global pandemic in full swing, causing massive disruption to #normal# working practices, Sarah revealed: It was the strangest start to a job that you could possibly experience.Having initially relocated from the Peak District to Donegal with husband Terry Coyleand six-year-old son Theo, Sarah was well aware of the challenge that lay ahead.I felt a real weight of responsibility to be broadcasting on a programme that reaches all of Northern Ireland at such an important time, said Sarah, who follows in the footsteps of GMU stalwarts Noel Thompson and Karen Patterson.With that in mind, I had to put to one side the weirdness of being only yards away from my entire sleeping family!As a presenter on the Manchester-based national  Live station for five years before landing the Radio Ulster role, Sarah is no stranger to flying solo, so how much is she enjoying being a co-host For news presentation, I believe a double-headed programme is the best way, she replied.It#s what I like listening to the most. It sounds a lot better, especiallythere#s good chemistry between the two presenters.She added: Having said that,I was doing, say, Desert Island Discs - Lauren [Laverne],you#re listening I#m coming for you - it#s my favourite programme ever and that would definitely be a single header for me.Celebrity interviewees during her  Live stint included Russell Crowe - she kept the teaspoon he stirred his coffee with, and then lost it Big Little Lies actor Alexander Skarsgard and Formula  star Jenson Button.The great thing about  Live was that you got to have such in-depth interviews with people you could never have imagined spending so much time with, from Stephen Fry to Stormzy, she said.It meant a lot of preparation, but it was an amazing gig.As Sarah, an only child, alluded to earlier, the main reason for coming home was to spend more time with parents Margaretand Aubrey but, sadly, she lost her father on August .We celebrated his th birthday on June , which was great fun, Sarah recalled.While I realise how appalling a year it has been for many people, I was deeply fortunate that the pandemic gave me the opportunity to spend quality time with my father that I otherwise wouldn#t have had... so I feel very blessed on that front.He#d been ill for a long time - he had a heart condition - but he soldiered on. He was on  dferent tablets.But while clearly knew how poor his health was, hilariously he was also quite the hypochondriac.Dad was absolutely convinced that I had given him coronavirus coming back from England. In the end he was tested for it, and of course he didn#t have it.Aubrey Brett died, surrounded by all the people he loved, including his we of  years.He passed away, here in the house, Sarah said.I was colouring-in with my son on a Tuesday morning around . I#d made my parents their breakfast in bed, then mum came in and told me dad was making a funny noise.I went in to his room and could see that he was in massive trouble.It was hard to tell whether he#d choked or was having a heart attack but, because I knew about his condition, I thought it was much more likely to have been the latter.I put him into the recovery position and cleared his airway and started CPR. I kept going until a friend came to the house with a defibrillator and took over.That was probably the most traumatic part, because you never expect to have to give your own father CPR. It was really, really dficult.Sarah also revealed that she has since tortured herself with dark thoughts.You wonderyou did it wrong, could you have done something more, she said.I spent the first week lying in bed every night, going over the entire thing.She said that when two teams of paramedics arrived they gave him everything they could, including injections and shocks with the EMT paddles.They worked on him for a further  or  minutes, she recalled. It was all so deeply distressing you#re pleased that they#re doing everything they can for him, but he#s lying on the floor of his bedroom.I can see my mum on the other side of the hallway and she#s looking at her husband lying there, with all of these people around him, and he#s in his PJs and not moving... it was absolutely horrendous.But, as she said: If there#s any consolation to be had, my dad died at home in a matter of minutes after a full breakfast, with his we beside him, with no fear or pain, and with the rest of his family around him.Describing her mum as being up and down in the aftermath of her husband#s death, Sarah said: Aubrey was her absolute everything her whole world revolved around him and vice-versa. She feels rudderless now.She recalled how much she enjoyed the previous Christmas with Aubrey, a former butcher, who worked at the world-famous Smithfield Market in London before going on to run a meat processing plant in England.Memories of  obviously made the most recent Yuletide a little harder to get through.We had many things in common but food and laughter were chief among them, she said. We loved being in the kitchen together, and on Christmas Day we were like a machine!And then there was the #turkey incident# from a few years backWe couldn#t fit everything into the fridge on Christmas Eve and my dad decided to put the turkey crown on an outside table, she said.When I got up on Christmas morning and looked out the window, I saw a load of plastic packaging rolling around... and when I went outside I realised it was the wrapping of what had been the turkey crown.That was all that remained of it. We#ve got a local fox - and the fantastic Mr Fox had seen his opportunity and taken it... he dragged the turkey away and we never saw a scrap of it on the big day. We ate a lot of ham that year...Husband Terry , whom she married in June , is an artist, as well as a fully trained teacher, and Sarah revealed that he#s one of those people who#s extraordinarily talented.He#s really good at landscaping and building and we#ve just bought a house that needs a lot of both of those things, which is handy.She added: I wasn#t sureeither marriage or children would ever happen for me.I#d a very close relationship with my parents, good mates, was working hard and just enjoying le. But then you meet somebody, and all of that goes out the window... Terry got me right when I thought I was about to get away with it!Recalling her time at  Live, Sarah spoke fondly of colleagues Chris Mason , Nicky Campbelland Dan Walker .Now that she is broadcasting from her little bunker, Sarah drives into Derry from Eglinton after getting up at .am. It is a big change from getting to bed in the wee small hours, which is what she did when she worked in England. My body clock#s shot to bits, but I absolutely love my new job, she said.So how does a busy working mum with a six-year-old manage to juggle everything As anyone with a demanding job and children will tell you... you#re knocking your pan in trying to be a brilliant mother and being the best you can at work, while at the same time feeling like you#re stuffing it all up.With fellow Radio Ulster presenter Stephen Nolan occasionally referring to GMU as Buckler#s Show, I ask Sarahshe would prefer it was called Sarah#s Show instead.With characteristic diplomacy, she replied: I#m very happy for it to stay as Good Morning Ulster.Who knows, maybe Desert Island Discs will one day have her name on it.Belfast Most ReadSammy Wilson defends Portrush visit after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Extended period of remote learning for schoolsBelfast woman Lucy McIlhatton killed in Springfield Road crashLegal loophole lets , speeders in Northern Ireland escape punishmentHow Co Down couple breathed new le into historic #Frankenstein house# Castle WardLatest Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Clarity expected on tougher restrictionsNorthern Ireland facing new Covid curbs after England goes into lockdownCampaign highlights brutal impact of #paramilitary attacks#Delays in treatment for stroke patients in Northern Ireland blamed on Covid pandemicLatest from Belfast Patrick ’GormanOpinionReimagining the city centres of the futureNorthern Ireland grocers remain #well prepared# Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Clarity expected on tougher restrictionsRevival of Co Down industrial site revampMilestone: , Co-Ownership homes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Barman Andy Nutt is preparing to pour the last measure at the well-known local pub.Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Dec   addthis, Knobbsrsquo Tavern closed in March, just before the pandemic arrived. In the week leading up to its final hurrah, we caught up with barman Andy Nutt and a few regulars.A well-known County Derry pub that has been in operation since  will close its door for the final time on Thursday.Knobbs’ Tavern in Kildoag, between Claudy and Donemana, was originally a grocery store that serviced the local area, but the community it sustained has been shrinking.On Saturday, they held a packed farewell concert, and when the County Derry Post caught up with a few of the regulars on the Friday afternoon, they were in reflective mood.“We’ll miss the yarns and the company,” said previous owner, Jack Knobbs, who was perched at the corner of the bar with his dog, Honey.“It was originally what they call a licensed shop and the first time it was opened as a bar was in . Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.” googletag.cmd.push Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. googletag.cmd.push  “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed. “It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!     “I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble. “I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above. There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore.     “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Lynn and Philip Hasson had arranged to get married in Donegals Redcastle Hotel in May, but the coronavirus outbreak halted their plans. The big day was rescheduled for November. However, as the date grew closer they were advised to move the celebrations to October in case lockdown restrictions got tighter again. When the ban on unnecessary cross-border travel came into force in early autumn, the couple were told they couldnt get married in the Republic. Undeterred, they rebooked their wedding at Derrys Beech Hill Country House in Ardmore at the end last month. googletag.cmd.push But on Wednesday, October , they got a call to say they would have to get married three days later, Saturday, October , before fresh lockdown measures came into play. After confirming that her son, Matthew, and his partner could make the wedding, Lynn gave it the go ahead. It was a bit crazy, I was working until .pm on the Thursday so we didnt have much time to pull it together, said Lynn, who is a support worker with Praxis Care. A host of Derry businesses pulled out all the stops to make sure the wedding could go ahead early and Lynn and Philip finally made it down the aisle. googletag.cmd.push We both have big families and lots of friends and we didnt want to leave anyone out so our initial wedding was for  people and ended up being for just  - including the bride and groom. In the end we only had close family and a few friends and they couldnt even bring their partners, but that was just the way it had to happen. There were a few people that couldnt come because they were isolating which was a pity.  Thankfully, Lynns two sons and Philips four children were able to attend. In the end it was very intimate and I stood back and looked and it was all the people that are closest to us which was lovely, said Lynn.     I was starting to think I was jinxed and in the run up to the wedding I was very nervous, but that day around lunch time all of a sudden I felt so, so relaxed. It was a brilliant day. And Lynn isnt resentful that she missed out on her big day As long as no one is sick then anything  is fixable, she said. I wouldnt want to be one of those families waiting on a phone call from the hospital. Lynn and Philp thanked everyone who made their last minute nuptials such a success. Wed like to say a special thank you to Aisling and Michael at the Redcastle who were excellent and gave us a full refund. To Jenny and James at the Beech Hill Country House for making everything run so smoothly and to Lisdale Signature Cars, Funky Cakes, Sass and Halo for the flowers, Natalie Doherty for the photography, Erin Gilroy for the make-up and Charlene Ferguson for the hair. And to my friend Anne Marie Boyle who did the balloons and decorations- she was my rock,” added the new bride.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Brendan McKeever was recently walking through Bay Road park in the city when he took a photo of a boat which has been stranded in the River Foyle since August.

With the Covid- vaccine continuing to be rolled out, there is hope that the pandemic will be brought under control as soon as possible in .

The vessel got stuck on sandbank close to the Bay Road park in August - and has refused to budge since. The owners of the boat have tried on several occasions to refloat it during high tides. However, it has stubbornly refused to move. The vessel has become something of a local tourist attraction and has been compared to the Bad Eddie boat which washed up on a Donegal beach in  and has remained there since. The Donegal boat attracts a huge amount of visitors each year and has also featured in a video for a Clannad song.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Colette Rogers, Strategic Lead for Tobacco Control with the PHA, said: “During the COVID- pandemic, our health is more important than ever. Stopping smoking now will have a positive impact on your health, not only in the long-term, but also sooner in ways you probably hadn’t thought about. For example,you smoke, your fingers are in contact with your lips, increasing the possibility of transmission of COVID- from hand to mouth. “This has been a dficult year in lots of ways, but you can use the New Year as an opportunity to take a positive step to quit smoking and make use of our free support services to help. googletag.cmd.push “Due to the present COVID- situation we have put plans in place to ensure you can access PHA-funded Stop Smoking Services while still following social distancing guidelines,” said Colette. “This may include telephone contact or video calls as opposed to face-to-face support. These measures will ensure you can still access Stop Smoking Services in a manner which is safe and convenient for you.” Studies have shown that you are four times more likely to quit with help. Local Stop Smoking Services, nicotine replacement therapyand support from your family and friends can make all the dference when you are quitting, so make sure you are familiar with all the help available. googletag.cmd.push “We know quitting smoking isn’t easy and it can take several attempts for many people to quit for good, butyou are determined you can do it,” said Colette. “There is lots of help available to support you to quit. If you have tried to quit before and relapsed, accept it, work out why it happened, and focus on how you can avoid it happening again. If you found you have relapsed due to the dficulty and stress of the pandemic, remember the positives. You have quit before and you can do it again! “We would encourage people to take the time to look at our website at www.stopsmokingni.info.     As well as support and advice, you will find real le stories of people in Northern Ireland who have quit successfully. You can get insight from their experience and what has motivated them as you consider your smoke free choices this New Year.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson said she is to meet the Norths Minister for Sport this week to discuss the proposal. The talks with Minister Deirdre Hargey take place on Wednesday amid mounting support for soccer to be reorganised on an all-island basis. The Foyle MLA said: “The past year has been hugely damaging for all sports, given the loss of gate receipts and other revenues. “Having two soccer federations on an island this size never made commercial or sporting sense and there had already been signicant support, North and South, for existing proposals to create an all-island structure. googletag.cmd.push “However, in the wake of the Covid pandemic and the impact it has had on the game, more and more soccer clubs are assessing their long-term sustainability and finding that the appeal of an all-Ireland league is obvious. “Structured proposals are already in place and signicant progress has been made regarding potential sponsorship of an all-island league. “It is also abundantly clear from the success of other all-Ireland sports such as rugby, boxing, golf, GAA, hockey and cricket that we can achieve great things when we work on an all-island basis. “This should not be a politically sensitive issue but rather one of what makes best economic and sporting sense to soccer clubs throughout the island. googletag.cmd.push That is the basis on which we will pursue our discussions with the minister and as we continue to progress this issue in the time ahead.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Eileen received the vaccine from Dr Michael McKenna at her local GP surgery on the Falls Road, Belfast. The rollout of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine follows approval from the Medicines  Healthcare products Regulatory Agencylast week and paves the way for a signicant acceleration of Northern Ireland’s vaccination programme. Speaking at the vaccination clinic, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said: “Today marks the first phase of our population vaccination programme and is a positive step forward.

The programme will then be rolled out based on age and other clinical vulnerability factors.” The JCVI has recently updated its guidance and has recommended that as many people on the JCVI priority list as possible should be offered a first vaccine dose as the initial priority. Dr McBride said: “The evidence has very clearly shown that both the Pfizer BioNTech and the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccines provide very high levels of protection after the first dose. googletag.cmd.push Providing that level of protection on a large scale will have the greatest impact on reducing death and hospitalisations, protecting the Health and Social Care system.

I feellikeI can really look forward to the year ahead now that I have been vaccinated. The nurses, doctors and staff have all been brilliant today so I would also like to say thank you to them.” Dr McKenna said: “We are very pleased to get this vaccination programme started for this vulnerable group of people.     Many of this group will have been virtually housebound since the start of the pandemic so today’s vaccinations are very welcome. I, like other GP practices, look forward to vaccinating more of my patients who are  or over in the coming weeks, moving on thereafter to other patient groups.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half.

He had lived in London most of his le, leaving Saul at the age of .Engaged to be married, but struggling to find the right ring, he found himself back in Northern Ireland on business he decided to call on his uncle Will, his only surviving Irish relative.It was the eve of the longest night of the year, a few days before Christmas, and a bitterly cold late afternoon. On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door. She ripped of her shoe and attacked the window screen. She turned to Jim. lsquoWhat do you know about fixing cars rsquo Jim shrugged.The bride pierced him with fiery blue eyes.lsquoAre you going to a fancy dress party rsquo he asked. lsquoI am going to be married,rsquo she replied. She banged the roof of the car with her shoe a number of times, hopping about attempting to put the shoe back on to her foot. lsquoLet me give you a lt,rsquo suggested Jim.In order to steady herself the bride hung on to Jimrsquos shoulder and finally won the battle of the shoe. lsquoThought yoursquod never ask.rsquo She lashed out at the motor with her fist, missed, spun around and fell into Jimrsquos arms.Saul Church was only a mile away. The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man. The bride jumped to her feet. Well done.rsquo She kissed him on the nose. lsquoItrsquos a lovely ring,rsquo said an embarrassed Jim. lsquoI am engaged, havenrsquot got the ring yet.rsquoThe bride grabbed the ring and placed it on to her finger lsquoThen you had best get a move on, you donrsquot want to lose her.rsquo She took out a hanky and blew her nose with considerable force.Jim noticed in the torch light that she was muddy and dishevelled, her face and red hair littered with spots of mud.lsquoYou donrsquot have a driver rsquo he asked. lsquoSmelly little man, didnrsquot trust him, kicked him out a mile or so back,rsquo she replied. Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring. Where did you get yours rsquo Jim inquired.                                                                    lsquoYou like it rsquo asked his odd passenger as she struggled in vain to apply lipstick. Jim smiled and nodded his head. The bride inspected her ring lsquoItrsquos very nice, expensive,rsquo she boasted. lsquoWas it handed down through your fianceacutersquos family rsquo The bride didnrsquot reply. lsquoI live in London, I am visiting my uncle Will, do you know him, Will OrsquoBrien rsquoJim noticed that the young lady was gazing out of the window, looking slightly lost, she was not in the mood for conversation. The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago. Her husband called around almost at once to see me, gave me this for you. How he knew yoursquod be here is beyond a mystery.rsquoUncle Will handed Jim a small box. He opened it. To his surprise it was a engagement ring, silver with a small amber jewel at its centre. Jim focused his eyes and read the inscription lsquoTo M.K, Saul .rsquo Uncle Will popped a bun into his mouth. lsquoYour young ladyrsquos called Mary Kane rsquo lsquoMaureenrsquos maiden name was Keenan, She married her husband back in, let me think...rsquo Jim closed the little box. lsquoAt Saul Church, Christmas ,rsquo he replied. His uncle was amazed. Jim had his ring.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever.

Mind you, he could have meant ‘lousy unionists’ in general, a description he applied to Churchill and Thatcher, as well as Johnson. Unionists have had decades of having to ‘make the best’ of lousy unionists in Westminster: indeed, almost every PM since Edward Heath, who prorogued Stormont in , has been accused of one form of betrayal or another.It isn’t just London-based unionists who are routinely accused of betrayal. Ian Paisley had regular outbursts about O’Neill, Chichester-Clark, West, Faulkner, Molyneaux , Trimble and Empey. Paisley was later unceremoniously dumped by the DUP when it thought his relationship with Martin McGuinnesswould see a flood of votes to Jim Allister’s newly formed TUV. Right now, in response to Johnson’s NI Protocol, the TUV, UUP, PUP and elements of loyalism are criticising the DUP for having got it so wrong with Johnson. Some in the DUP, unwilling to concede they were stupid to place all their eggs in a basket held by Johnson and the ERG, are now blaming the UUP for having supported the Good Friday Agreement in . Hmmm. That would be the same agreement the DUP claimed to have improved and then implemented with Sinn Fein since May , wouldn’t it    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...\"Boris Johnson, flanked by Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster, at the DUP conference in After Johnson addressed the DUP conference in  – when he promised to stop anything which would push NI into some sort of semi-colonial status – I spoke to one of the party’s most senior players: “Do you really trust Johnson  Do you not even entertain the possibility he and the ERG will let you down ” His answer was brutal: “The DUP is not the rollover UUP, Alex. We are not the puppets in this relationship. We won’t be letting May, Johnson or anyone  dictate the terms.”Yet Boris Johnson did betray the DUP. He promised them one thing and then did the opposite. He lied to the DUP’s inner core of leadership and negotiators. He came to a pre-election event in Northern Ireland last November and told the audience – mostly local Conservatives, bless them – to tear up and place in the bin any letters they might receive about any new border. In later interviews he continued to dismiss claims he was prepared to support any policy which might be construed as ‘undermining or weakening’ NI’s constitutional position. And therein lies the real problem for unionism. What Johnson did wasn’t unique. Like so many prime ministers before him – most of whom claimed to be supporters of the geographical constitutional integrity of the UK – he prioritised other interests over the interests of NI unionism. So, bearing in mind that he is merely the latest in a long line to follow the same course, what conclusion should unionists here reach  The immediate one, obviously, is that prime ministers and their parties don’t give a stuff about NI: because they have no emotional attachment to it.If that is the case, then it raises all sorts of other questions and problems. If you don’t have an emotional attachment to something then why hold onto itit is, as seems to be the view of many MPs down the years, more trouble than it is worth  Yet, why would successive UK governments, particularly during the years when the IRA was armed and active , seem so determined to find a way of placating SF rather than crushing armed republicanism  Why did successive UK governments invest more time and energy in building a working relationship with successive Irish governments  Why did successive UK governments – after the  referendum – conclude so many below-the-radar, nod-and-wink side deals and arrangements which would have required IRA Army Council approval   Why did the May Johnson governments – both propped up by the DUP – seem to think it of greater necessity to reassure the Irish government than the DUP or broader unionism Why is the DUP now reduced to the absurdity of pretending – and it really is a pretence – Johnson’s betrayal doesn’t actually amount to a hill of beans  Why does it continue with the pretence it can find ways to mitigate the impact of an arrangement which has the imprimatur of the EU, Johnson’s government and a whopping parliamentary majority  Why does it still trot out the line it can all be sorted by a vote in the Assembly in four years’ time I’m not overwhelmingly convinced successive UK governments have been actively determined to disengage from Northern Ireland. That said, nor am I convinced they would shed any tearsa majority voted to leave in a border poll. The task for unionism – and I’ve said this many times – is to read and fully understand the intentions and end purpose of UK policy since Stormont’s prorogation in . It seems to me there are two continuing priorities: a an absence of terrorist campaigns – a huge drain on resources and b an arm’srelationship in which NI remains in the UK but doesn’t require too much oversight or present too many problems. The task for unionism, in NI’s centenary year, is to bear that in mind and find a strategy and narrative which understands and accommodates the UK’s long term priorities for here.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The BBC’s Robbie Meredith outlined that the alternative admissions criteria went no further than: application to sit a transfer test this year, sibling attending the school, parent having attended the school, and proximity to the school. These are social selection criteria which,adopted across the Province, would create a year of comprehensive education for Northern Ireland with irreversible consequences.It would open the door to the demolition of the grammar school system by its opportunistic opponents.None of the aforementioned commentators have any genuine claim to objectivity in the current academic selection debatenor any right to dominate the side of this debate which claims to “put children first”. Champion for Mental Health, Professor Siobhan O’Neill, outlined that the test was putting additional unnecessary pressure on children this year. What might she make of Daniel McCrossan’s comments on yesterday morning’s Nolan show, when he used language like “it is not safe” and that the test will “risk people’s families”, claiming that “these children, when they leave test centres will carry infection back to vulnerable family members”  Does this not unnecessarily increase the stress placed on children going to sit a test in four days’ time, when a public official claims that their doing so will lead to them putting their own families at risk  When I contacted AQE chief executive, Dr Darrin Barr, for a comment on this, he outlined the following reassurance: “We have met every public health requirement, and more, that has been asked of us to ensure that parents can feel safe to send their children to complete the test.” He outlined further that detailed risk assessments have been completed by a group of principals of the test centres, in line with public health advice, to produce general advice for all test centres which was then tailored to each specic centre based on the logistics of that school.My message to parents is clear: in the midst of a pandemic, we are all clearly at risk. It is incumbent on us all to mitigate against those risks, to ensure a more positive future for everyone once this chaos passes. Using children in the midst of that chaos is unforgiveable, and something which public ‘leaders’ ought to avoid in pursuing their own ideological obsessions. • Dr William Kitchen is an academic and author——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...\"Some of the Spar branded products on the shelves of Sainsbury’s in Belfast todayIn an indication of the cost of the certicates, which must be filled in by a specialist such as a vet, the government has set up a scheme to compensate those having to fill in Export Health Certicates at a cost of up to £ a time, although it is unclear how long that government scheme will last.Supermarkets and some of their suppliers have been given a temporary ‘grace period’ exempting them from that part of the new bureaucracy until April .Today the News Letter saw multiple items which would require Export Health Certicates – including fresh pasta, sausages, ham, pork – on the shelves of a major Sainsbury’s store in Belfast.A member of staff said that about  product lines had been lost “because of Brexit” but that several hundred of them had been replacedwith local alternatives, some of which was the Spar produce.Sainsbury’s website shows  Spar own-brand items, including bacon, houmous, ready meals, deserts, chorizo and soured cream. However, some of those items do not yet even have a basic description, dietary information or ingredients on the website.Sainsbury’s confirmed that it had “a temporary supply agreement with Henderson Wholesale Ltd”, the Mallusk-based company which supplies  Spar and Vivo stores across Northern Ireland.In a brief statement, Sainsbury’s said: “A small number of our products are temporarily unavailable for our customers in Northern Ireland while border arrangements are confirmed.“We were prepared for this and so our customers will find a wide range of alternative products in our stores in the meantime and we are working hard to get back to our full, usual range soon.”An industry source said that talks between Hendersons and other major retailers had been going on since the middle of last year as a result of Brexit and the uncertainty which businesses have faced because decisions on the post-Brexit regime were left to the last minute.\u2028The Henderson Group said: “Over the last several months we have been contingency planning for Brexit to minimise any disruption to the food supply chain for our  stores across NI after st December .“We can confirm that we have entered into a temporary supply agreement with J. Sainsbury supermarkets that will see both parties working together to ensure availability for our customers.“Henderson Group is a major employer and retailer covering every part of NI. Over % of our fresh products are sourced and made locally.”Last Friday, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis tweeted: “There is no ‘Irish Sea Border’. As we have seen today, the important preparations the Govt and businesses have taken to prepare for the end of the Transition Period are keeping goods flowing freely around the country, including between GB and NI.”When asked on the Andrew Marr shows yesterdayshe accepted that there is now a border in the Irish Sea, Mrs Foster appeared to play down the signicance of something which she once denounced unequivocally. She said: “Well, it’s my job to mitigate against that and we’ve been doing that through a number of committees. There’s a regulatory issue there – of course, we always had SPS [animal product] checks, Andrew, you know that, when animals and animal products came across into Northern Ireland those were checked on a very minor basis and we need to make sure that that minor basis continues.”Mr Marr put to Mrs Foster just some of the multiple acronymns for the new red tape which has been introduced for GB companies wanting to sell to Northern Ireland. He put to her that “it looks very like a border”, to which the DUP leader replied: “Well, you know, I could stand here and bemoan the fact that we have left the European Union with a protocol I wish that that wasn’t the case, or I can now look for the opportunities as we move out of the EU...”On New Year’s Day last week, DUP Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots – whose officials constructed and are operating the new border under the eye of EU officials – tweeted to thank major pro-Brexit donor Arron Banks: “Thank you for all you done [sic] to make it happen.”:Irish Government did secret deal with Gerry Adams to free IRA prisoners days after  ceasefire, declassied file revealsIrish Government deliberately did not condemn ceasefire murders by IRA in  to keep Sinn Féin on board, declassied file revealsUlster Farmers’ Union lobbied for ‘unequivocal’ government statement on beef safety – months before BSE link to humans, declassied file showsCivil servants paid equivalent of £, a day for advice from ex-civil servant, declassied file revealsGerry Adams was ignorant of basic Protestant views and didn’t think he had to persuade unionists to back a united Ireland: Declassied fileGovernment pondered renaming or giving away Stormont as it meticulously planned for the Good Friday Agreement, declassied files reveal——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years.

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And light does more than create a festive mood mdash light brings hope.ldquoFor Christians, Jesus is lsquothe light of the worldrsquo, but we canrsquot celebrate his birth today in quite the usual way. People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi. But we need le to go on.ldquoLast month, fireworks lit up the sky around Windsor, as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, providing joyous moments of hope and unity mdash despite social distancing.ldquoRemarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has, in many ways, brought us closer. Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit. To our young people in particular I say thank you for the part you have played.ldquoThis year, we celebrated International Nursesrsquo Day, on the th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale. As with other nursing pioneers like Mary Seacole, Florence Nightingale shone a lamp of hope across the world.ldquoToday, our frontline services still shine that lamp for us ndash supported by the amazing achievements of modern science ndash and we owe them a debt of gratitude.ldquoWe continue to be inspired by the kindness of strangers and draw comfort that ndash even on the darkest nights ndash there is hope in the new dawn.MORE NEWS:Do you know what happened to this poor kitten How Sully came together at Christmas through the power of the artsAll the supermarket opening times over Christmas and New YearldquoJesus touched on this with the parable of the Good Samaritan. The man who is robbed and left at the roadside is saved by someone who did not share his religion or culture. This wonderful story of kindness is still as relevant today.ldquoGood Samaritans have emerged across society showing care and respect for all, regardless of gender, race or background, reminding us that each one of us is special and equal in the eyes of God.ldquoThe teachings of Christ have served as my inner light, as has the sense of purpose we can find in coming together to worship.ldquoIn November, we commemorated another hero ndash though nobody knows his name. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior isnrsquot a large memorial, but everyone entering Westminster Abbey has to walk around his resting place, honouring this unnamed combatant of the First World War mdash a symbol of selfless duty and ultimate sacrice.ldquoThe Unknown Warrior was not exceptional. Thatrsquos the point. He represents millions like him who throughout our history have put the lives of others above their own, and will be doing so today. For me, this is a source of enduring hope in dficult and unpredictable times.ldquoOf course, for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety, when all theyrsquod really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.ldquoIf you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.ldquoThe Bible tells how a star appeared in the sky, its light guiding the shepherds and wise men to the scene of Jesusrsquos birth. Let the light of Christmas mdash the spirit of selflessness, love and above all hope mdash guide us in the times ahead.ldquoIt is in that spirit that I wish you a very happy Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt is expected that at least , doses will be available within the first two weeks of the rollout.Last week, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencyauthorised the AstraZeneca vaccine as safe and effective following stringent clinical trials - just three weeks after the first coronavirus vaccine, Pfizer BioNTech, was approved for use across the UK.The Welsh Government and NHS Wales have been preparing for the vaccinationsrsquo approvals and delivery since June.Around  million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been procured for use in the UK.Two doses will be needed, with an interval of between four and  weeks between doses.This is a change from previous advice for both vaccines of a four week gap between doses, as the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas recommended that as many people as possible in the top priority groups should sequentially be offered a first vaccine dose as the initial priority.Based on a UK-wide priority system, the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine has already begun to be administered to frontline health and social care staff, as well as care home residents and staff and people aged over  and the AstraZeneca vaccine will enable more.Latest figures to end of Sat th December show that more than , people have so far received the first dose of the vaccine.Every health board in Wales will receive their allocation in proportion to the size of its priority population and ability to deliver, as outlined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationrsquos prioritisation list.Unlike the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine is stored at normal vaccine fridge temperatures.This means it will have few storage and transportation issues, making it much easier to use in community settings such as care homes and primary care settings like GP surgeries.People are asked not to phone their GP, pharmacy or hospital asking when they will get a vaccine.When someone is in one of the groups eligible for the vaccine, they will be invited to attend a dedicated clinic which will have been set up to ensure patient safety and that of the healthcare professionals.Correspondence will come from local health boards and the vaccine is free of charge through the NHS.People are warned to be alert to scams asking for money or personal information.Health minister, Vaughan Gething said: ldquoToday marks a key milestone in our fight against the COVID- pandemic.\"The roll-out of the AstraZeneca vaccine has been called a lsquogame changerrsquo and this is true - its potential should not be underestimated.ldquoIn less than a month Walesrsquo NHS has mobilised the largest vaccination programme our country has ever seen and so far more than , people have received their first dose.ldquoNow, only  days since regulatory approval of the new vaccine for use in the UK, a second vaccine is here and ready for use, signicantly adding to Walesrsquo defences in the face of coronavirus and protecting our most vulnerable.Senior responsible officer for Walesrsquo COVID- vaccine programme, Dr Gillian Richardson added:ldquoIt is fantastic news that there is now a second vaccine to help protect our communitiesrsquo most vulnerable from the harms of COVID-.ldquoPace will be governed by supply, which will start slowly this week but build vastly over the coming weeks and months.\"However, vaccinations are happening in GP surgeries from today and we will also see an increase in our vaccination centres over the course of this month.ldquoIt is so important that people continue to wait their turn for the vaccine ndash you will be contacted when your time comes.\"Please do not contact your GP or local pharmacy and add unnecessary pressures to their workload. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
