The Clooneys made the wedding and the after party guest list, and Markle family seats in the church were taken by stars like Oprah WinfreyI wasn’t entirely surprised though given my own bizarre ‘ghosting’ experience with Ms Markle that suggested to me she’s a ruthless social climber.No wonder then that her family feel less than enamoured towards the newly ennobled Duchess: she’s dumped them all like a sack of rancid potatoes, lest they poison her perfect new privileged royal well.I thought of this today when I read George Clooney’s impassioned defence of Meghan over recent negative headlines.He attacked the media: ‘They’re just chasing Meghan Markle, she’s being pursued and vilified.’Then he directly compared her to Harry’s mother, Princess Diana: ‘She is being pursued and hunted and chased in the same way that Diana was, and it’s history repeating itself.’He ended with a chilling warning: ‘And we’ve seen how that ends. I can’t tell you how frustrating it is to see that.’Hmmm.  On Monday George Clooney attacked the media: ‘They’re just chasing Meghan Markle, she’s being pursued and vilified.’ Then he directly compared her to Harry’s mother, Princess Diana: ‘She is being pursued and hunted and chased in the same way that Diana was\u0027George Clooney claims his friend Meghan is being \u0027pursued...PIERS: Meghan Markle is a social climber and ghosted meShare this articleThere is a certain irony in Clooney saying all this just days after Meghan directed five of her best friends to speak to People magazine and knife her poor father in the back.Just as there was when Diana harangued the media for intrusion, but would repeatedly collude with newspaper journalists (I know, I was one of the people she colluded with!) to get herself positive press coverage and settle scores with people she didn’t like.Clooney at least is consistent he furiously blamed the media entirely for Diana’s death.To him, there is no correlation between using the press to promote or spin your brand, and then being scrutinised by the same press, sometimes critically.To me, there is.When she met Harry, Meghan wasn’t some naïve young 19-year-old virgin like Diana. She was a 35-year-old orcee with a successful acting career who knew exactly what she was doing.She landed her handsome, much younger Prince, and now enjoys the spectacularly opulent lifestyle of palaces and servants that comes with marrying into the British royal family.She has milked all the global fame and attention that’s subsequently come her way with obvious glee.  Meghan wasn’t a naïve  19-year-old virgin, but a 35-year-old orcee with a successful career when she landed her handsome young Prince. Diana was the biggest star on the planet Meghan isn’t even in the top three stars living at Kensington PalaceAnd honestly, if this is the life Meghan’s always dreamed of, then good luck to her.But there is absolutely no comparison between the amount of media attention she gets and the amount Diana experienced.Diana was the biggest star on the planet Meghan isn’t even in the top three biggest stars currently living at Kensington Palace.And Clooney is not just wrong about that.He’s also wrong to blame the media for negative headlines driven largely by Meghan’s own family.They are the ones vilifying her because she has disowned them all, and they understandably feel hurt about that.Meghan’s letter to her father, that he only disclosed this week after the People magazine cover story came out, was a template in the modern scourge of celebrity victimhood.It was all about HER feelings, HER marriage, HER life, HER pain.But what about her dad’s feelings - HIS life, HIS pain?          Meghan’s letter to her father was a template in the modern scourge of celebrity victimhood. It was all about HER feelings, HER marriage, HER life, HER painI’ve interviewed Thomas Markle twice, and get the impression he’s a decent guy who hasn’t had a clue how to handle the enormous media scrutiny that came when his daughter married a prince.Yes, he’s made mistakes, like posing for staged photos with the paparazzi, and he’s admitted to them.But he’s also lost his little girl, the one he helped bring up, educate, nurture and succeed. The one who posted a touching Father’s Day card on Instagram just weeks before she met Prince Harry, telling Thomas how much she loved him.Meghan can try to pin all the blame on her dad for this mess, as she’s now doing, but has she really been as blameless as she would have us all believe?It’s staggering to me that Harry still hasn’t met the man whose daughter he married.It’s staggering to me that neither Meghan nor Harry has bothered to go see Thomas, even after he suffered a heart attack.          Meghan can try to pin all the blame on her dad for this mess, but has she really been as blameless as she would have us believe? It’s staggering  that Harry never met the man whose daughter he marriedIt’s staggering to me that Meghan thinks the way to resolve this bitter dispute is to unleash her friends to attack her dad in People magazine.And it’s staggering to me that George Clooney now believes it’s a good idea to blame the media for everything, and compare Meghan to Diana.Clooney is a smart guy.He must have sat in the church at the big wedding and secretly shared everyone else’s view that it was very odd to see just one person from the bride’s entire family there amid a sea of celebrities.The problem here isn’t the media, which has largely given Meghan a very positive ride.The problem is Meghan’s incredibly toxic relationship with her family that shows no sign of abating and in fact, gets worse by the day.A real friend would tell her to get on a plane with her husband, and make peace with her ailing, flailing father – before it’s too late.But is George Clooney a REAL friend, or just another famous person Meghan’s latched onto at the expense of those who until recently, she professed to care about most?The biggest problem here may lie in the answer to that question."},{"url":null,"title":"Wreck carrier USS Hornet discovered South Pacific","story":"    The Hornet is seen under heavy attack by Japanese e bombers at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on October 26, 1942, where it later sunk          Inside the online room of the RV Petrel as the team views the USS Hornet for the first time          A sonar image of USS Hornet as researchers discover the wreck in the South Pacific last month          Two of the 20 mm Oerlikons located on the port quarter of USS Hornet are seenThe lost letters of the SS Gairsoppa: More than 700...Wreck of Japanese submarine that was sunk after World War II...Share this articleThe Hornet was a Yorktown-class carrier, best known for launching the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo and participating in the Battle of Midway.\u0027With the loss of Hornet and serious damage to Enterprise, the Battle of Santa Cruz was a Japanese victory, but at an extremely high cost,\u0027 said Rear Admiral (Ret.)

Vonn celebrates with Italy\u0027s Sofia Goggia (left) after winning bronze in Sunday\u0027s downhill \u0027I was weighing in my mind the risk of putting it all out there, crashing and getting injured again, as opposed to finishing where I wanted to,\u0027 Vonn said. \u0027It was an internal battle.\u0027As soon as she exited the finish area, Vonn embraced Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark, the only skier to win more World Cup races than she did - 86 to 82.\u0027I basically begged him to come here via text, in all caps, many exclamation points,\u0027 Vonn said. \u0027He\u0027s an icon and a legend in our sport and he doesn\u0027t really like the spotlight but he deserves to have it. I was just so grateful that he was there. Honestly, it\u0027s a perfect ending to my career.\u0027          Predators defenseman P.K. Subban and Lindsey Vonn have been an item since 2018The third skier on the course, Vonn had a big smile on her face when she came down with the fastest run to that point. She waved and bowed to the crowd.At 34, Vonn eclipsed her own record from two years ago for oldest woman to win a medal at a worlds.Fog and wind forced organizers to shorten the course to the second reserve start, which favored Vonn because it reduced the strain on her knees.Now she can finally let her body heel and move onto the next phase of her life - possibly acting, having children, starting a business .\u0027I\u0027m looking forward to just chilling out a bit and recovering everything, including my mind,\u0027 Vonn said. \u0027It\u0027s been a lot to process.\u0027The nice thing is that, in the real world I\u0027m actually pretty young. I have felt really old for a long time, because I\u0027m racing with girls that are like 15 years younger than me. So now, in the real world, I\u0027m normal. Thirty is the new 20 so I\u0027m super young. I\u0027ve got a lot to look forward to.\u0027             Vonn poses with her medals, which include an Olympic gold from the 2010 Vancouver Games       In this January 20, file photo, Lindsey Vonn hugs a US team staffer in the finish area of an alpine ski, women\u0027s World Cup super-G in Cortina D\u0027Ampezzo, ItalyBROKEN LEFT ANKLE, August 2015Injured during preseason training camp in New Zealand. Wasn\u0027t ready to return at the start of the World Cup season in October, but did compete in late November.TORN LIGAMENTS IN RIGHT KNEE, BROKEN BONE IN RIGHT LEG, February 2013Vonn needed reconstructive surgery after tumbling when she landed in a patch of soft snow during the super-G at the 2013 world championships in Schladming, Austria. She tried to come back but got hurt again in a crash while training in Colorado in November and during a World Cup downhill at Val d\u0027Isere, France, in December, tearing her repaired ACL and requiring another operation on her right knee. Announced in January 2014 she would have to miss the Sochi Olympics.CONCUSSION, February 2011Injured her head in a fall during World Cup practice in Austria. About a week later, she initially decided to compete — \u0027skiing in a fog,\u0027 Vonn called it — at the world championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, before eventually withdrawing.BRUISED RIGHT SHIN, February 2010Slammed her right leg in slalom practice 10 days before the Vancouver Olympics started. Initially, could barely walk. BRUISED LEFT FOREARM, December 2009Crashed on the first run of a World Cup giant slalom in Lienz, Austria, losing her balance after a sharp turn and falling backward. She wound up not missing a race.CUT RIGHT THUMB, February 2009Safe to say Vonn\u0027s oddest injury came off the slopes during the world championships in Val d\u0027Isere, when she needed surgery after hurting herself with a champagne bottle during a photo op gone awry after winning gold in the downhill. HYPER-EXTENDED RIGHT KNEE, BONE BRUISE, February 2007Partially tore her right ACL in training. Sat out her last two races at the world championships in Are, Sweden, after winning two silvers earlier. Missed the rest of that World Cup season.ASSORTED BRUISES AND ACHES, February 2006Scary fall during downhill training at the Turin Olympics caused a bruised thigh, aching back and sore pelvis. She left the hospital — even trying to grab her belongings and sneak out when the checkout process was taking longer than she wanted — and competed less than 48 hours later. (source: Associated Press)                                                     "},{"url":null,"title":"Venezuelas socialist government vows blocking international aid shipments","story":"    A fuel tanker, cargo trailers and makeshift fencing, blocking the Tienditas International Bridge in an attempt to stop humanitarian aid entering from Colombia          Aerial view of trucks loaded with humanitarian aid for Venezuela drive to the Tienditas Bridge on the border between Cucuta, Colombia and Tachira, VenezuelaThe pair – career politicians who appear oblivious to the suffering of the people they represent – claimed despised dictator Maduro enjoyed the support of most Venezuelans. And standing on the Venezuelan side of the Tienditas Bridge – with the aid stockpiled just 1km on the Colombian side - the MPs raised their fists in defiance of the international community and proclaimed ‘!No Pasaran - It Will Not Get Through!’ ‘The so-called humanitarian aid is just a media show,’ Mr Barrera, who represents the city of San Cristobal, told MailOnline. ‘The United States, in alliance with the Colombian government, is using the aid as a pretext to invade Venezuelan territory.‘We have seen what happened in Syria and Libya and we don’t want that to happen here. While we want peace, we would never allow foreign troops to set foot on our sovereign territory.’Mr Barrera, 26, a student socialist activist turned politician, acknowledged that Venezuela was in the midst of a severe economic crisis.But the blamed the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom for the severe shortage of food and medicines, caused the ‘sanctions’ they had imposed on Maduro’s corrupt regime.He said: ‘I know we have problems. But this is because of the international sanctions that have been imposed upon us. Britain stopped the sale of our gold for example.‘This is a battle between socialism and capitalism.

The measures against Mr Guaido (centre) \u0027have not been adopted in accordance with constitutional requirements, normal legal procedures and international human rights standards,\u0027 according to U.N. adviser Diego Garcia-Sayan‘The aid is an excuse to invade. ‘Venezuelans are not beggars, we have our own resources.’ Mr Parada said that while many people in the border area have relatives across the border in Colombia no true patriot could accept foreign troops stepping foot on Venezuelan soil. ‘We could never let that happen,’ he told MailOnline. ‘We have seen how United States and their allies have confiscated Venezuelan bank account and companies. ‘We demand that these countries give us back our resources.’ As the politicians made gestures soldiers from the Venezuelan Army held positions on the Tienditas Bridge border crossing. Wearing camouflage uniforms and brandishing automatic weapons the troops have orders to stop by force anyone trying to move the containers and fuel tanker that form a blockage against trucks carrying aid. Opposition leader Juan Guaido has vowed to open a humanitarian corridor into the country. He has called for volunteers to distribute the aid to Venezuela’s needy. But in a worrying development a brigade of Venezuela’s feared FAES para-military police – that has been blamed for the summary execution of more than 150 anti-government protesters – were spotted arriving at a military airport close to the Colombian border.

The ad was banned by Transport for London.          Launched last September, Lumen hit the headlines almost immediately — but not necessarily for the right reasonsCharly is unrepentant. They used a photo of a real-life model, Paul Orchard (age 58), to show mature daters can be sexy and have a sense of fun. \u0027That shouldn\u0027t be news to anyone — yet the fact that it became a national news story shows it is.\u0027Then, last week, Lumen revealed its most successful fiftysomething users — all of whom looked eminently datable — causing another media storm.The result is that Lumen is not only one of the most talked about dating apps, but more than 250,000 singles have signed up, making it the most popular app for over-50s in the UK.Ironically, it took two tech-savvy thirtysomethings to come up with the idea. Do they really know what it\u0027s like to be single after orce or bereavement? Or the horror of being the only fiftysomething woman on a singles holiday? Perhaps not, but both do have experience of online dating.Despite her youthful appearance, Charly, 35, has been a dating consultant for six years. She used to be an agony aunt for website eharmony and is the creator of The Dating Awards, the Oscars for the online dating industry. Currently single, she uses dating apps.Her business partner Antoine Argouges, 30, previously at dating apps Badoo and Bumble, met his wife on a French dating app.\u0027I enjoy making products that change people\u0027s lives as much as one changed mine,\u0027 he says.Charly says this sets them apart. \u0027We know the pitfalls, we know the frustrations. So we\u0027ve tried to work functionality into the app.\u0027Which means making it as easy as possible to meet genuine, like-minded singles in a safe space.In fact, over-50s have been a forgotten generation in tech. Until recently you couldn\u0027t even create a Tinder account if you were over 50. And even now you get lumped into the 55+ category (with no chance to show your inidual age).Most dating services aimed at fiftysomethings started as websites used on a home computer (eharmony, Our Time, Plenty of Fish) or matchmaking agencies.The feeling was that \u0027mature daters\u0027 like me wouldn\u0027t find apps easy to navigate. But now 73 per cent of those aged 50 to 59 own a smartphone, Charly thinks we\u0027re ready to embrace the technology.Tinder for cows! Match-making app for livestock allows...Digital Secretary to write to dating apps amid concerns...Share this articleI\u0027m going to need some convincing, to be honest. Even though I spend my life glued to my phone and laptop, I\u0027m not thrilled by the idea of dating apps. I\u0027m short-sighted, so dread tiny print.Plus, I prefer a full screen so I can read carefully about potential daters. There are lots of \u0027red flags\u0027 you can spot from photos, such as the lack of furniture (even bachelor pads should have chairs) or an ex-wife chopped out of the picture.My younger friends get exasperated. \u0027You\u0027re quite a modern, happening woman,\u0027 says one. \u0027You can use Uber. You need to widen your repertoire with dating apps.\u0027The truth is I\u0027m quite a slow, deliberate dater, which doesn\u0027t work in a world of \u0027swipe culture\u0027.I like an A4-size screen to write on, and the chance to scroll back over messages.But Charly reassures me that sending messages on the Lumen app is no different to using Facebook Messenger to contact friends. And it\u0027s true. The app is clearly designed, simple to operate. I can scroll back over messages. It\u0027s also a relief to get a notification on my phone when someone contacts me rather than having to keep logging into a website.Once registered, you can start chatting immediately. Lumen claims to be the only mainstream dating app to insist on 100 per cent photo verification, so you know who you are talking to is really who they say they are.When you register, you are required to upload a selfie as part of the verification process and an algorithm authenticates this image against other pictures provided.The technology is so sophisticated it can detect age too. \u0027If you look significantly younger than 50, a human moderator will look at it. \u0027And it will match your age against your Facebook site, if you log in that way, too.\u0027 Youngsters get a polite rebuttal. Necessary, says Charly, because women in their 50s get targeted by men in their 20s and 30s on other sites. \u0027I hadn\u0027t realised the phenomenon of cougar hunting was such a big problem,\u0027 she admits.The app is not swipe-based. Which is refreshing when the average attention  of someone on apps such as Tinder is a terrifying six seconds. \u0027One of the things we heard from people in their 50s and 60s is they were put off by the disposable treatment of people on certain apps.\u0027Each profile must have a minimum of three photos (Tinder asks for one), plus an \u0027about me\u0027 section and a \u0027what I\u0027m looking for section\u0027. Profiles also have \u0027badges\u0027 — height, ethnicity, kids, liberalconservative — which give you an overview of people\u0027s leanings. Lumen allows you to start three new conversations a day (though you can read and reply to any number of messages). Once you have reached your limit, you can double your number of conversations and see who has favourited you by paying for Premium Mode (from £7.99).They\u0027ve designed the app to encourage meaningful conversations. Your ice breaker message should be at least 50 characters long. It\u0027s not good enough just to say \u0027hi\u0027. Though I did get one gem from Ian, 56: \u0027I\u0027m orced two kids. Area manager. What are you looking for?\u0027 Which felt like a three-act play in two sentences.When someone messages you, you have 72 hours to reply (on Bumble it\u0027s 24 hours.) Lumen will send you a reminder, but after that, the message disappears and the person can\u0027t contact you again. The app is location-based so you will be sent profiles depending on where you are during the day (plus their location distance from you).I couldn\u0027t help noticing the real-life women Charly showed me on the site looked intimidatingly good, while the men weren\u0027t always showing their best side.But I really like the way Charly and Antoine are on a mission to have an age-positive influence on society, from their adverts to their hands-on advice.Did it work for me? Not entirely.I had several friendly messages from men in their 50s and 60s (and was favourited 20 times, which is an ego boost for any woman), but I could see our jobs might be incompatible (does a butcher really want an arts journalist who is out every night?).That said, a month on I\u0027ve had coffee with a guy who lives locally, and works in the arts. And a promising conversation with an author.No photo messaging or nudity is allowed on Lumen (phew!). Though there were some quite sexually forward profiles \u0027Mood, food, drink, kink,\u0027 boasted one 62-year-old musician\u0027s profile.While a white-haired author, 52, declared: \u0027We are not going to get married. However we are going to enjoy an erotic interlude\u0027 (dear God why are writers always the worst?). But Tinder users won\u0027t be shocked.I miss being able to search by words such as \u0027film\u0027 or \u0027architecture\u0027. But Charly tells me: \u0027The app prioritises those closer to you and shows you those who have been active recently, so you might want to use it when you\u0027re in a more creative area of town, if this is what you\u0027re looking for.\u0027Any disappointment I might feel is down to the reality of dating, she adds bluntly. \u0027We have worked hard to provide a space which allows you to meet other over-50s, who actually want to meet people of the same age. Beyond that, I\u0027m afraid you will still be limited by those available.\u0027While I probably prefer a site where people have chosen to pay, there is a joy to being among your peers, who know your age, and that you\u0027ve already made a lot of key decisions — about work, kids, independence — in your life.Charly admits they do hear the occasional unkind comment from men — saying they\u0027d never join because the older women must be duds, \u0027which I find really interesting because, from my own completely subjective opinion, I think the women on Lumen are way hotter than the men. And it\u0027s not just Lumen. Because single women over 50 look after themselves more than single men over 50. These women are absolute catches.\u0027Lumen can be downloaded free from the App Store and Google Play Store.  The brutal truths I\u0027ve learnt from 100 dates by Cosmo LandesmanOver the past five years I\u0027ve been on more than 100 dates. I\u0027ve dated all types — the good, the bad, the beautiful and the totally bonkers.Divorced and now 64, I\u0027ve fallen in and out of love, and been dumped, bumped, ghosted and roasted by every sort of woman you can imagine. The good news is, I\u0027m still sane (I think!). The bad news is I\u0027m also still single.So what kind of dating expert am I? Knowledgeable? Not really. Experienced? Yes. Honest? Absolutely. I can\u0027t promise to reveal the trick to finding your soulmate for one simple reason: after a 100 dates I\u0027ve discovered there isn\u0027t one.          Over the past five years I\u0027ve been on more than 100 dates. I\u0027ve dated all types — the good, the bad, the beautiful and the totally bonkersBut that doesn\u0027t mean you don\u0027t need to make an effort. It\u0027s easy to fall into a lazy, anti-dating state of mind that says: why bother having a drink with that person? I can stay home with a box set! Stay home and you stay alone.If you\u0027re looking for love, you need to tear up the dating rule book and write your own. Hopefully, what I\u0027ve learned will inspire you to do just that.Don\u0027t worry about your age!When I was young, I\u0027d worry there would come a day when I would be too old (anything passed 50) for hot dates, cold martinis and crazy sex on the ceiling. But I was wrong (OK, the ceiling days are over.) One of the great impediments to dating and romance is age anxiety. If you\u0027re over 50, don\u0027t worry about being too old for this or too old for that. It\u0027s a waste of time.Older female friends of mine complain that once you are over 50 you become the \u0027invisible woman\u0027. It\u0027s not true. You\u0027re only invisible to shallow men, who aren\u0027t worth dating.So when a man asks you your age, don\u0027t act coy: say it loud and proud. That kind of confidence is attractive. This goes for men, too. There\u0027s nothing sadder than a middle-aged man who imagines he can fool women into thinking he\u0027s younger than he is with pictures taken a decade ago or heavy-handed dying of the hair.\u0027It\u0027s so hard to date\u0027Stop telling yourself that! It\u0027s just an excuse not to make the effort. Meeting a potential partner has never been easier. There are more than seven million singletons over the age of 50 in Britain and numerous dating sites.Personally, I\u0027ve always preferred meeting people at parties or cultural events. The hard bit is being brave enough to ask them out on a date. Middle-aged men suddenly become tongue-tied teens when asking a woman out. Be bold. And, if you can\u0027t be bold, pretend you are!The same is true for women. I know women think they have to wait for the man to ask them out, but why? On the rare occasion a woman has asked me, I\u0027ve always said yes on principle. Go on, ask him out! The worst that can happen is he says no. (Actually, that\u0027s not true. The worst that can happen is you acquire an admirer who is a ferocious bore who sends disgusting pictures of himself to you at midnight!)When dating, you have to keep an open mind. It\u0027s easy to get stuck in a \u0027this-is-my-type\u0027 rut and only date people of a certain social group or profession.In the past few years I\u0027ve asked out the woman who runs my local charity shop, a lesbian novelist, the solicitor who did my probate and the doctor who checked my prostate. I even dated my former dentist. We had sex, but it was only a temporary filling! (And, yes, she loved that joke!)My point is, it\u0027s good to get out of your social comfort zone. I have only one dating prohibition: young women — anyone under 50. Never trust a man who dates really young women. That\u0027s more about looking good to other men than liking the woman for who she is.As for women dating younger men, I guess the odd fling is fine as long as they\u0027re not too young.Failure is a friendOK, so now you are starting to date. The first few encounters are fine, but not worth pursuing. Then you meet someone you like. You think they like you. You have a few more dates and you decide they\u0027re The One.Suddenly, they stop calling and don\u0027t reply to your texts. You\u0027ve been dumped — or \u0027ghosted\u0027, as they say. Ouch! That hurts! It happens. And it will again.But if you keep dating, there comes a point when rejection doesn\u0027t hurt any more. And if you\u0027re honest, it\u0027s not your heart that\u0027s broken, but your ego that\u0027s bruised. Just keep going. Dating is not a sprint, it\u0027s a marathon.Make an effortWomen are better at this than men. British men have no idea about good grooming.I see these men at single party events all the time: they have nose hair down to their knees, crazy Denis Healey eyebrows and they\u0027re wearing a cheap, ill-fitting suit — and these are men with plenty of money!They just can\u0027t be bothered to make an effort to look good. And then they leave the event on their own and wonder what\u0027s wrong with those women!The art of talkingOK, you\u0027re on your first date. What do you talk about and, more importantly, what do you avoid? Conventional dating wisdom says you should never talk politics. But they\u0027re wrong. Your political values are a part of who you are and what you believe. If they can\u0027t handle your position on Brexit, tough.Another forbidden topic is moaning about former partners — it\u0027s called Baggage Bonding. I disagree. Hearing about other people\u0027s romantic disasters makes you feel better about your own. It\u0027s also a good way to find out what sort of person you might be getting involved with.Remember, the dating world is full of narcissists, selfish and insensitive creeps, and at some point you will be sitting opposite one and thinking: my, what a charming and intelligent manwoman you are! Dater beware.Watch for the small signs that tell you big truths about your date. Do they ask questions about your life and opinions? I once dated a woman who, after talking about herself for most of the evening, said to me: \u0027OK, that\u0027s enough about me. Let me ask you, what do you think of me?!\u0027Does your date laugh at your jokes? Are they ever funny? Do they keep checking their phone? Do they take themselves very seriously? Are they rude to the waiter? A yes to any of these is an instant deal breaker.Sex after 50How long should you wait before sex? If you wonder if you should wait, then you should you will know when the time is right.Are you dreading getting naked before a new lover? We all do. American writer Diane Mapes once wrote: \u0027Dating in your 50s isn\u0027t bad. It\u0027s getting naked that is brutal.\u0027 I used to think that, too. Then a wise woman told me: it\u0027s not the shape of your body that makes you attractive — it\u0027s the confidence with which you carry it that counts.Sexy is a state of mind. So no more worrying about your wobbly bits. That\u0027s life. That\u0027s you. And if someone doesn\u0027t like it, show them the door.Don\u0027t lose faithI must confess, I\u0027m still waiting to learn many of these lessons. But then, we\u0027re all good at giving other people advice. A hundred dates later I have lost a lot of illusions about what you have to do to find love — but I still believe that, if I keep looking, with a bit of luck, I will find it. Till then, I will lighten up, have a laugh and keep on dating.   I was about to give up...then I met my perfect match onlineDebbie petty, 50, a former NHS administrator, split from her first husband, with whom she had four children. She met Lawrence, 47, a orced engineer, on eharmony. Here they share their story...          Debbie petty, 50, a former NHS administrator, met Lawrence, 47, a orced engineer, on eharmony. Here they share their story...Debbie says:Just before I read Lawrence\u0027s dating profile, I\u0027d taken the decision to wipe my online presence and have a long break from the whole thing.I\u0027d tried a handful of free sites and, to be honest, I\u0027d had my fill of disappointing dates with men, who either didn\u0027t look anything like their pictures or were clearly lying about their age.At 44, I\u0027d been orced for a decade I was working full-time and juggling family, too. Finding love seemed like a thoroughly lost cause.In fact, it was my 16-year-old son, Lewis, who persuaded me to give it one more chance and sign up to a site you actually had to pay for, where the men might be more serious about commitment. I think he thought I deserved a bit of luck.And then, quite quickly, up popped Lawrence. His profile was full of humour and kindness and I remember catching my breath as I read it.The trouble was, he lived almost 240 miles away from me in Devon. Plus there was no picture! He\u0027d signed up so recently, his photo still hadn\u0027t been verified. But it didn\u0027t matter — I messaged him, and over the next few days we began to have an online conversation that felt natural and made me laugh out loud.We liked all the same things — animals, art, sci-fi films, family — and when his picture appeared, well, that was a brilliant bonus. He looked just as lovely as he sounded.It really felt like my luck might be changing. But then I got ill. I had blinding headaches and terrible pain in my jaw.A week or so later, I collapsed and had to be rushed to hospital. I\u0027d still never met Lawrence, but Lewis knew how much he was beginning to mean to me, so he phoned him to tell him where I was.I had to stop him rushing to me — the last thing I wanted was to meet him for the first time in a hospital gown!It turned out I had an infection in a nerve that had travelled to my brain: I was pretty sick, but throughout my recovery, Lawrence was my rock and we messaged all the time.Two months after we\u0027d \u0027met\u0027 online, we met in real life. It was nerve-racking because by then I really did think I\u0027d fallen in love, but I also knew it might feel very different in the flesh.To my great relief, the attraction was instant, and we stayed up that first night talking and laughing till 4am. Lawrence and I were married in July 2016. I honestly understand why people get despondent about online dating — it can seem like hard, confidence-sapping work. But love is out there: we\u0027re proof of it.Lawrence says:For about six months I dabbled with online dating, but didn\u0027t take it seriously. My orce was quite long and drawn-out, and I wasn\u0027t really in the right frame of mind. I certainly didn\u0027t tell any of my friends I was doing it and I ignored a lot of replies because, frankly, they seemed a bit crazy.But that first online conversation with Debbie on eharmony was completely different.I remember reading the questions she asked me with a big smile on my face because they were exactly the sort of questions I wanted to ask her. It felt like the first real, honest conversation I\u0027d had with a woman online.Immediately I could relate to her. In fact, it felt as though we\u0027d known each other for ever.There was nothing awkward about it and I loved the way she looked in her pictures. Every time she messaged me, I felt my stomach flip.When Lewis phoned me to say Debbie had been rushed to hospital, I packed a bag straight away and checked train times to Shropshire, where she lived. This connection we had felt very real, and I was really worried about her. I even spoke to her dad. In the end, she told me not to come and instead we messaged each other and talked every day while she recovered.Weeks later, we were desperate to meet, and when she suggested making the trip to see me, I leapt at it. I remember her getting out of her car outside my flat and looking up at me. I was so nervous. I told her we should go to the pub across the road for some Dutch courage!We hadn\u0027t told each other on the phone that we loved one other, but I think that first real \u0027date\u0027 proved it. She stayed for a week!We found that we could talk about deep subjects very quickly and, at our stage of life, I think you know instinctively when something is right. After that we travelled up and down to see each other every weekend. I immediately loved her kids, and they seemed to like me back.A year and a month after we met online, I asked her to marry me. We all moved in together and, two years after that, we tied the knot in Shropshire, with an Alice in Wonderland-themed garden party after the wedding.I love my new life with Debs and her family. We don\u0027t have tons of money and there are still bumps in the road now and then, but I have honestly never been happier.Interviews by Alison Roberts    Eharmony (eharmony.co.uk) has 30 million members worldwide and claims to have created more long-term relationships and weddings than any other dating site. A spokesman said: \u0027We have seen a rise in 50-plus singles looking to find love.\u0027           Saga dating (sagadating.co.uk) is one of the longest running sites aimed at over-50s. It\u0027s free to browse, but you need to subscribe to send a message. Prices start at £28 for one month or £10.50 per month for one year.           Ourtime (ourtime.co.uk), from the team behind Match.com, is only open to those aged 50-plus. It has more than 190,000 users.

He is now the fourth member of the team to pass away          Leicester City goalkeeper Gordon Banks (foreground) leaps as he goes after a shot that went wide during the FA Cup 5th round match against Leyton Orient at the Brisbane Road Ground in London on March 16, 1963      Banks and Pele would become close friends following the \u0027save of the century\u0027 in Mexico almost 50 years agoWorld Cup teammate Sir Geoff Hurst said: ‘Very sad to hear the news. One of the very greatest. Sad for football.’Sir Bobby Charlton added: ‘Gordon was a fantastic goalkeeper and I was proud to call him a team-mate. He will be deeply missed.’ Ex-England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, who replaced Banks at Leicester City, tweeted: ‘I’m devastated – today I’ve lost my hero.”Ray Clemence, who also kept goal for England, said: ‘Someone I looked up to and a great mentor. Definitely England’s greatest goalkeeper.’Former Leicester City striker Gary Lineker said he was ‘an absolute hero of mine... such a lovely, lovely man’.Even the German football team paid its respects, tweeting an image of him embracing German players after the 1966 final with the words: ‘A fierce opponent and a good man. Rest in peace, Gordon Banks.’Even at the height of his career he never earned more than £100 a week, and his reward for helping England beat West Germany at Wembley on July 30, 1966, was £1,000, plus a standard £60 appearance fee and a new raincoat, donated by a London tailor.Combined with various misfortunes that beset his post-football business career, he had to auction his World Cup winner’s medal for £124,750, and the cap he was awarded for the game for £27,025.Banks, so proud to represent his country that he said he would have gladly turned out for nothing, was reluctant to sell such mementos but did so to help his three children. Many other 1966 teammates were pressed into selling their treasures.Together, several, were overlooked when major gongs were handed out. Though made an OBE four years after the World Cup victory, quite why Banks wasn’t deemed worthy of a knighthood remains a mystery.After all, he was voted the world’s top goalkeeper by FIFA for six consecutive years between 1966 and 1971, and is considered to have pulled off the greatest save ever, during a World Cup match against Brazil, in Mexico, in 1970.So certain was Pele that he had scored, he shouted ‘gol’. Yet he hadn’t reckoned on England’s own genius, who jack-knifed downwards, extended his arm like a periscope, and used his little finger to scoop the ball over the bar.Pele led the applause and in the eyes of football’s cognoscenti, that moment of gravity-defying brilliance elevated Banks to be the greatest goalie of all-time.To football fans of my generation (I was ten in 1966), Banks was the ‘keeper who made goalies glamorous. Until we saw his heroics, none of us volunteered to go in goal.If his achievements on the pitch weren’t sufficient for a knighthood, his many admirers argued, then why not make the award for his charity work? In his later years, he worked for an Alzheimer’s charity, worried that his England teammates Nobby Stiles, Martin Peters and Ray Wilson had contracted the disease by repeatedly heading heavy leather footballs.On the 50th anniversary of England’s World Cup triumph, he admitted feeling hurt that knighthoods had been awarded to only two of the eleven, Geoff Hurst and Bobby Charlton. While not begrudging these accolades, he said it ‘seemed unfair’ to single anyone out when football was a team game. His frustration was the more understandable given his humble beginnings.          Banks made his name at Leicester and is pictured catching a dog at Filbert Street in 1965          Banks makes a flying save while playing for Leicester in 1966. He represented the Foxes at the height of his career          In 1970 came the greatest save of all time against Pele, who shouted \u0027goal\u0027 when he headed it towards goal but could not beat Banks in the World Cup group stages in MexicoThe son of a foundry worker, he was raised in a two-up, two-down terraced house in the Sheffield suburb of Tinsley, with three brothers, the eldest of whom was disabled by bone-disease, and died at 34. Watching his brother face up to his illness with cheerful resolution shaped Banks’s life, he said, teaching him to accept every adversity and ‘just crack on’.Like most boys, he adored football, but his ambition to play professionally was stirred when the only family in his street with a TV set invited him to watch a night match. He was mesmerised by the floodlights and the sight of the white-coloured ball.Leaving school at 15, however, he earned £3 a week bagging coal, then became a bricklayer.          England goalkeeper Gordon Banks with his wife Ursula and their children Robert, 12, and Wendy, 7, at Buckingham Palace for his investitureHis break came when he went to watch a steelworks team whose goalie failed to turn up. Invited to stand in, he dashed home to grab his boots and a pair of work trousers which he tucked into his socks. He did well enough to be picked for the team’s next match – but facing better opposition, he let in 12 goals.Nonetheless, by the end of the season he’d been scouted by Football League team Chesterfield and signed a contract in 1959. The following season he was sold to Leicester City.In 1963, he won the first of his 73 England caps. Manager Alf Ramsey said he was ‘the best goalkeeper I have ever seen’. Inevitably, he was Ramsey’s first name on the team sheet. He played every match in the 1966 World Cup, and his wife Ursula cheered him on during the final even though she was German.Banks had been stationed in Germany on National Service with the Royal Signals and had met her while buying a shirt in the shop where she worked. After receiving his winner’s medal from the Queen, he and Ursula returned to their rented semi in Leicester. Their car was a modest Standard Eight, the sort a low-grade rep might drive.If England’s No 1 thought World Cup victory would change his fortunes, he was sorely mistaken.There was no homecoming parade – just a small reception at the town hall. No lucrative commercial offers or endorsements, though he did some adverts for a sweater company. No pay rise from Leicester City either – within nine months, the 28-year-old had been replaced by teenage prodigy Peter Shilton and sold to Stoke City, where there is now a statue in his honour.‘I’m not exaggerating, but afterwards everything was normal. Back to business. I don’t think we realised the magnitude of the World Cup and what it meant to the people of the country until several years later,’ he recalled.          In 1972, at just 35, a car crash derailed Banks\u0027s career when it left him blind in one eye and he was forced to retire    Banks met his wife Urusla while on National Service in Germany back in 1955Football experts believe England would have retained the cup in Mexico in 1970 if Banks had been in goal for their quarter-final, against West Germany again.Hours before the game, he was taken ill with a virulent stomach bug. Since he’d eaten the same food as the other players, none of whom was sick, there was speculation he was deliberately poisoned – a theory Banks subscribed to.Attempts to get him fit by feeding him scrambled egg and sweet tea failed, and he was replaced by Peter Bonetti, whose nervous errors condemned England to a 3-2 defeat.In October 1972, Banks was still England’s first-choice goalkeeper when catastrophe struck. Overtaking a car on a bend, his Ford Consul struck a van, head-on, and his head hit the windscreen with such force that it shattered the glass.Lying in the wreckage, his right eye blinded by shards of glass, he knew his career was in jeopardy. Yet, typically, his thoughts were with a little boy in the van. “I could hear him crying but luckily for me he wasn’t hurt. I couldn’t see, but I was relieved to hear that,” he would say, admonishing himself for causing the accident.With surgeons unable to save his sight, Banks’ big-time goalkeeping days were over, though with just one good eye he was talented enough to make a comeback, playing a season for the Fort Lauderdale Strikers in the US.          toke City and England goalkeeper Gordon Banks recuperates at the North Staffordshire Infirmary following a car crash which cost him the sight in his right eye. He retired from football as a resultSurprisingly, he didn’t get a well-paid career as a specialist coach. After a couple of lowly posts managing youth teams, he was appointed manager of non-league Telford United.Although his results were good, his laconic style apparently didn’t suit the club’s bosses and he was sacked. His final humiliation had come when the club ordered him to sell lottery tickets in a local supermarket. Banks said he ‘naively’ complied, believing he would have breached his contract had he refused.So, aged only 40 and bitterly disillusioned, the goalie whose agility had made Pele gawp in disbelief drifted out of football.He became ill-advisedly involved with several flawed business ventures, including the promotion of a dubious car-dealing company, before earning a comfortable living by consultancy work, after-dinner speaking and serving on the Football Pools Panel (which predicted the scores of postponed matches).It enabled him to ‘keep my head above water’, as he put it. He and Ursula lived happily in the Staffordshire village of Madeley – in a house filled with footballing memorabilia and photos, though not, alas, his World Cup medal – where they were visited by their three children and grandchildren.Having lost one kidney 14 years ago, Banks was discovered to have cancer in the other. The illness, and his chemotherapy treatment, made it painful for him to walk, yet he faced his plight with typical fortitude, tending to his garden and continuing to play golf with the use of a buggy.            A piece of advice given by Gordon Banks to a promising young goalkeeper has come to light          Banks carries the Olympic Torch in front of Wembley on July 25, 2012, two days before the start of the London 2012 OlympicsFor many years, he attended get-togethers with the team of 66. He is the fourth to die, after Bobby Moore in 1993, Alan Ball in 2007 and Ray Wilson last year.He enjoyed reminiscing with his old Stoke teammates – who would address him as ‘Sir Gordon’ in recognition of the honour he ought to have received.Among his most regular callers was former captain Dennis Smith, who visited on Sunday.‘The world has lost one of the great players and we have lost a great friend. A true gent,’ Smith said yesterday.‘Worldwide, they knew him. You could go to Africa, Russia, Australia, wherever, and they all knew Gordon Banks. Even the youngsters.’Indeed they did, for there will never be another Banks of England. He was the gold standard."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/12/12/1A31FD6200000514-0-image-m-31_1549974147001.jpg","title":"Lloyds rocked new whistle blowing claim Insider says bank drove companies wall","story":"    New allegations: Lloyds bankers are accused of conspiring to tip firms into administration by loading them with fees they could never payRumours have long swirled that big banks destroyed companies in the wake of the financial crisis to confiscate property and shore up their own balance sheets – claims the lenders deny.But this is the first time an insider involved in the process has spoken out about what went on.Plus500 was \u0027too good to be true\u0027: Shares in online trading...ALEX BRUMMER: Understanding how the culture of the banks...I paid $10bn in taxes but it STILL wasn\u0027t enough! Microsoft...Make firms pay more in tax if they hand their bosses\u0027 huge...Share this articleFees back in tradesFees back in tradesGood for big potsTools and fund ideas\u0026gt Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":null,"title":"55 000 thank yous","story":"    The volunteer army will wage war on the litter blighting our towns and countryside (stock)Microplastics found in the sea carry toxic bugs which poison...Let\u0027s go wild on litter!

On the streets and in Central Park, on the subway, in movie theatres and diners, on Coney Island and in New Jersey homes, in grim apartments, in revue dressing rooms, at the circus and in the morgue. With her 35mm camera and her eye, her ability to confront, cajole and to seduce, her talent was as much one of gaining trust – or at least something more than tacit refusal – from her subjects.Diane Arbus, In the Beginning focuses on these first eight years of her work as an independent photographer, following over a decade in the fashion photography business, where she and her husband Allan Arbus worked together, he as photographer, she as stylist and art director. The exhibition, which has travelled to the Hayward from the politan Museum in New York, is filled with strange encounters, not least with ordinary people. Just as German photographer August Sander never reduced his subjects to their roles (some of them appear to have managed that without any outside help), so life spills out of Arbus’s images.More than provoking mere curiosity, Arbus teases our imaginations. Looking at her images we invent backstories and narratives we can never be sure of. She makes us stop and look, just as she did. The Santa Claus on the street, his beard awry, stock-still and somehow tragic as a woman passes by. The woman pausing on the sidewalk, the old couple on the park bench. What went through Arbus’s mind about their lives? What went through theirs as they paused for her? We can’t know. Everyone has a story to tell but we don’t hear it, though she makes us know it is there.Arbus makes everyone exceptional, even if she only met them for as long as it took to take a picture. The stern, impatient woman in white fur with a cigarette, one hand on her hip, haloed by festive Christmas lights. Miss Makrina, a Russian midget, mopping her kitchen floor, looking up and smiling broadly. A young man with a greasy paper bag on Coney Island, kids stepping on and off the kerb. The boy under the low-slung lights in the pool hall, the woman on the street with her eyes closed, daylight examining her face. Even as they tumble, each image makes me stop, then makes me want to go both backwards and forwards, searching for something I’m not sure of. The upper galleries of the Hayward are a forest of pillars, with images hung on their broader faces, one on either side. Weaving between them, we also weave our stories of an imaginary mid-century New York. Each step is a surprise.Arbus seemed to arrive almost fully formed as a photographer, after a few private lessons with Lisette Model, an Austrian émigré photographer who had studied music under Arnold Schoenberg in Vienna and painting in Paris under the tutelage of André Lhote (who numbered Henri Cartier-Bresson among his other students). Although maintaining a friendship with Model for the rest of her life, Arbus quickly found her own way.As much as anything else, it was as if she had been waiting to give herself permission to begin. Arbus’s images, and her approach, have over the past half century insinuated themselves into our mental landscape. We know her best as the photographer of the stooping giant in the living room, the spooky, identical twin sisters in their matching outfits, drag queens (referred to, quaintly, as “female impersonators”), the grimacing kid with the rictus grin and the toy hand grenade the boy in the straw boater with the pro-Vietnam war badges, but there was a great deal more to her, more subtlety, more strangeness than these.A movie usher in his cap, long coat and braid, hovering behind the rope in the cramped foyer. The raking seats of a 42nd Street movie theatre, with the smoke-filled cone of light gouging the darkness. Arbus shot the images on the screen too: a closeup of a couple kissing (from the movie Baby Doll), a still from a Mighty Mouse cartoon, with a moustachioed cowboy, his sombrero full of arrows. A woman screaming, blood all over her hands. Sometimes there is a macabre humour at play. A headstone at the absurdly named Bide-a-Wee cemetery in Wantagh, NY has the single word Killer on the stone. Maybe it is a pet cemetery. Knowing would spoil the fun. The title doesn’t say. Sometimes Arbus’s titles are as redolent as any Tom Waits song – The Madman from Massachusetts in an Empty Bar, NYC Hezekiah Trambles, “The Jungle Creep”, on stage at Hubert’s Museum – or like something from Scott Fitzgerald – Miss Marian Seymour Dancing with Baron Theo Von Roth at the Grand Opera Ball.Sometimes a little more background would be useful. Arbus’s drag performers, backstage, putting on lipstick, sitting around, are mostly members of the Jewel Box Revue, a troupe of “25 Men and a Girl” that successfully toured the country, to mostly straight audiences, for three decades from 1939 onwards. The one girl was a black lesbian drag king.There is so much here. Fake rocks on wheeled pallets at Disneyland in California. A wax museum axe murderer at Coney Island, a girl on the street in New York, looking up. The quotidian and the extraordinary collide, again and again. The original exhibition is augmented at the Hayward by a number of later, mostly better-known square-format images, shot between 1962 and 1970 and first printed as an edition, A Box of Ten Photographs, in 1970. The following year Arbus, who suffered severe bouts of depression (she was probably bipolar) killed herself. The world goes on, teeming with stories and iniduals, people stepping on and off the kerb."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0c7301986897f30e933777e6a22e3c8e72046fb/56_201_3185_1910/master/3185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b68aa0d732785130d1dc2a70107eec6d","title":"tell us what books are the most shocking or disturbing","story":"On this week’s books podcast, we discuss the works that we struggled to finish – or even had to hide – because they were so shocking. “I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us,” Franz Kafka once wrote. “If the book we’re reading doesn’t wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for?”That’s all very well, Kafka, but how about the books literally about wounding and stabbing? On this week’s books podcast, the ’s resident thriller fan Alison Flood struggled to finish The Flower Girls, a new thriller by Alice Clark-Platts, the plot of which contains similarities to the James Bulger murder case. This sparked a discussion on the books desk about the books that have most disturbed us: commissioning editor Richard Lea had nightmares after reading Colson Whitehead’s zombie novel Zone One I once had someone hide my copy of American Psycho so I’d stop dwelling on it and associate culture editor Claire Armitstead once destroyed a copy of Naked Lunch by William Burroughs, because she was so disturbed by a particular scene: “I put it in the fire! I have never destroyed another book … but I didn’t want anyone else to read what I’ve read.”On Twitter, readers shared the books that have most disturbed them: Hanya Yanagihara’s A Little Life was a common choice, as was John Fowles’s The Collector and VC Andrews’s Flowers in the Attic.

But veterans of the debate know they are equal in determination that Britain should leave the EU. They are separated from consensus by small technical matters that can, for theatrical effect, be inflated into irreconcilable differences. That process is testimony to the hold that the two-party system exerts over English politics and to much of what is wrong with it.Brexit keeps promising to break party lines and then failing to do so. That is partly because pro-Europeanism and the British left stand on overlapping cultural ground. The remain proposition goes well beyond attachment to EU membership: it is driven by revulsion at the nativist spirit of Brexit’s marauding generals – Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg – and shock that they have hijacked Britain’s political identity. But that dismay is not exclusive to Labour. It is felt by liberal Tories and swing voters who just pine for competent, rational government.The result of the last general election was confusing, in that sense. Corbyn’s strength on the stump accounts for some of Labour’s performance. But so does May’s self-destructive campaign, reinforcing caricatures of Tory nastiness and repelling anyone with doubts about Brexit. On 8 June 2017 three forces combined to Labour’s benefit: Corbynism, vaguer anti-Toryism and remain – in what proportions no one knows. The fault lines were then concealed by an outbreak of loyalty among Labour MPs. Those who had expected voters to despise Corbyn’s candidacy were chastened. For various reasons (some genuine reappraisal of the leader’s qualities and an absence of better ideas) the moderates mostly fell into line. Many found sanctuary in the pro-European cause, which brought reconciliation with the rank and file membership. MPs who had been out in the cold because of their hostility to Corbyn took a warm bath in grassroots affinity for remain.The internal opposition was dormant, not extinct. Corbyn’s mealy-mouthed response to the Salisbury poisonings, marked by reluctance to blame the Kremlin, drove some MPs to distraction. His refusal to show any regret for a career spent rubbing shoulders with antisemites has pushed others to despair. But the European question has kept many dissidents from quitting. They thought they had a better chance of influencing the Brexit outcome from inside the party. That conviction has crumbled in recent weeks. Corbyn’s Euroscepticism is on display more clearly than at any time since his days as a backbencher, when he denounced the EU as a sinister imperial project. Old videos of him railing against the Brussels enemy as a “military Frankenstein” are now gleefully shared by Ukippers online. The Labour leader’s constant reluctance to back a second referendum was for months excused as tactical caution. Increasingly, it looks like sabotage.Labour pro-Europeans have been taken for a ride. Their Tory equivalents are now grasping the scale of their symmetrical defeat. Moderate Conservatives once predicted that Brexit bluster would be dispelled by diplomatic reality and that Commons arithmetic would impose a sensible settlement on May. There is still time for that to happen, but not much. Away from Westminster, the party is in an uncompromising mood. Earlier this week, Grantham Conservatives initiated the process to deselect Nick Boles, their local MP. His offence was to say he would renounce the Tory whip sooner than endorse a no-deal Brexit. A few days earlier, Labour’s MP for Liverpool Wavertree, Luciana Berger, had faced charges of disloyalty to Corbyn. A no-confidence motion against her was withdrawn only when noxious social media posts from within the constituency party made it impossible to deny that Berger was targeted in part because she is Jewish.These episodes are symptomatic of a purifying mania that will shrink the two broad churches of English politics into intolerant sects. One quivers in anticipation of Brexit rapture the other hunts blasphemies against the supreme leader. Many Labour MPs see this process as irreversible. Corbyn commands the members’ faith. When he goes, his successor will pledge to honour his legacy. A similar realisation is dawning on moderate Tories. A successful candidate to replace May must seek endorsement from the Europhobic backbench commissars.It is certain, on those trajectories, that MPs will leave their current parties. But to what end? Obstacles to a new venture are familiar. The electoral system suffocates startups. A gang of refuseniks from left and right would disagree on issues that Brexit has obscured, starting with tax-and-spend policies. There is already a pro-EU centre-party, the Liberal Democrats, which is not surfing any vast anti-Brexit backlashes. Schismatic Labour MPs say Vince Cable’s tribe would fold into a fresher-looking insurgency, but even then the target audience is uncertain. Labour and Tories marshall erse voter coalitions. A post-remain newcomer would energise middle-class metropolitan graduates, which is a launchpad, not a wide base. Miserable Labour and Tory MPs know all of those problems, but one factor is overcoming fear of breaking away abhorrence at the thought of staying where they are.The standard accusation against “centrist” politics is that it is all tactical calibration with no ethical compass. It is scorned by radical left and right alike as a cavilling creed for unprincipled careerists. But the careerist route doesn’t run through the centre any more. The two main parties still control the best jobs in British politics. The greasy poles to climb are planted in the camps of Corbynism and Europhobia. In that sense, the strongest argument against a new party – that it would be pointless, and would fail – is the best argument for doing it anyway. A futile gesture at least looks motivated by something better than cynical ambition. Showing no fear of failure is one way the enterprise would look principled.How many voters in the country would identify with a movement born in simultaneous aversion to Corbyn and Brexit? Could it be viable in an election? No one can be sure. The only way for rebellious MPs to find out is to admit that they have no better options, summon the courage, and try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aca3c1aece8f749354d24cffd5656f4f87d4c43/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=117900faa1bca5ecb527239587df3c62","title":"eu soviet union european elections george soros","story":"In May’s European elections, anti-EU forces will be on the rise. Those who want to preserve the union’s values must wake upEurope is sleepwalking into oblivion and its people need to wake up before it is too late. If they don’t, the European Union will go the way of the Soviet Union in 1991. Neither our leaders nor ordinary citizens seem to understand that we are experiencing a revolutionary moment, that the range of possibilities is very broad, and that the eventual outcome is thus highly uncertain.Most of us assume the future will more or less resemble the present, but this is not necessarily so. In a long and eventful life, I have witnessed many periods of what I call radical disequilibrium. We are living in such a period today.The next inflection point will be the elections for the European parliament, in May 2019. Unfortunately, anti-EU forces will enjoy a competitive advantage. There are several reasons for this, including the outdated party system in most European countries, the practical impossibility of treaty change and the lack of legal tools for disciplining member states that violate the principles on which the EU was founded. The EU can impose its laws on applicant countries but it lacks sufficient capacity to enforce member states’ compliance.The antiquated party system hampers those who want to preserve the values on which the EU was founded, but it helps those who want to replace those values with something radically different. This is true in inidual countries and even more so in trans-European alliances. The party system of inidual states reflects the isions that mattered in the 19th and 20th centuries, such as the conflict between capital and labour. But the cleavage that matters most today is between pro- and anti-European forces.The EU’s dominant country is Germany, whose dominant political alliance – between the Christian Democratic Union and the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union – has become unsustainable. The alliance worked as long as there was no significant party in Bavaria to the right of the CSU. That changed with the rise of the extremist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). In last September’s länder elections, the CSU’s result was its worst in more than six decades, and the AfD entered the Bavarian parliament for the first time.The AfD’s rise removed the raison d’etre of the CDU-CSU alliance. But that alliance cannot be broken up without triggering new elections that neither Germany nor Europe can afford. And the ruling coalition cannot be robustly pro-European while facing the AfD threat.The situation is far from hopeless. The German Greens have emerged as the only consistently pro-European party in the country, and they continue to rise in opinion polls, whereas the AfD seems to have reached its high point (except in the former East Germany). But now CDUCSU voters are represented by a party whose commitment to European values is ambivalent.In the United Kingdom too an antiquated party structure prevents the popular will from finding proper expression. Both Labour and the Conservatives are internally ided, but their leaders, Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May, respectively, are determined to deliver Brexit. The situation is so complicated that most Britons just want to get it over with, although it will be the defining event for the country for decades to come.Collusion between Corbyn and May has aroused opposition in both parties, which in the case of Labour is bordering on rebellion. May has announced a programme to aid impoverished pro-Brexit Labour constituencies in the north of England. And Corbyn is accused of betraying the pledge he made at Labour’s last party conference to back a second Brexit referendum if he can’t trigger a general election.The chances that May’s deal will again be rejected by MPs are growing by the day. That could set in motion a groundswell of support for a referendum – or, even better, for revoking Britain’s article 50 notification.Italy finds itself in a similar predicament. The EU made a fatal mistake in 2017 by strictly enforcing the Dublin agreement, which unfairly burdens countries, such as Italy, where migrants first enter the EU. This drove its predominantly pro-European and pro-immigration electorate into the arms of the anti-European League party and Five Star Movement in last year’s election. The previously dominant Democratic party is in disarray. As a result, the many voters who remain pro-European have no party to vote for. There is, however, an attempt to organise a united pro-European list. A similar reordering of party systems is happening in France, Poland and Sweden.When it comes to trans-European alliances, the situation is even worse. National parties at least have some roots in the past, but these alliances are entirely dictated by party leaders’ self-interest. The European People’s party (EPP) alliance is the worst offender – almost entirely devoid of principles, as demonstrated by its willingness to embrace Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party in order to preserve its majority and control the allocation of top EU jobs. Anti-European forces may look good in comparison: at least they have some principles, even if they are odious.It is difficult to see how the pro-EU parties can emerge victorious from the May elections unless they put Europe’s interests ahead of their own. One can still make a case for preserving the EU in order radically to reinvent it. But that would require a change of heart within the EU. The current leadership is reminiscent of the politburo when the Soviet Union collapsed – continuing to issue edicts as if they were still relevant.The first step to defending Europe from its enemies, both internal and external, is to recognise the magnitude of the threat they present. The second is to awaken the sleeping pro-European majority and mobilise it to defend the values on which the EU was founded. Otherwise, the dream of a united Europe could become a 21st-century nightmare.• George Soros is the chairman of Soros Fund Management and of the Open Society FoundationsA version of this article has also appeared on Project Syndicate"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3cdc5eb4b6d9489a0e3adeb19da169bed55f235/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89d3d3214a3669ed19d5faf202db4499","title":"dark money hard brexit targeted ads facebook","story":"Targeted no-deal Brexit ads are funded opaquely, yet the government has failed to bring in new lawsModern governments respond to only two varieties of emergency: those whose solution is bombs and bullets, and those whose solution is bailouts for the banks. But what if they decided to take other threats as seriously?This week’s revelations of a catastrophic collapse in insect populations, jeopardising all terrestrial life, would prompt the equivalent of an emergency meeting of the UN security council. The escalating disasters of climate breakdown and soil loss would trigger spending at least as great as the quantitative easing after the financial crisis. Instead, politicians carry on as if nothing is amiss.The same goes for the democratic emergency. Almost everywhere trust in governments, parliaments and elections is collapsing. Shared civic life is replaced by closed social circles that receive entirely different, often false, information. The widespread sense that politics has become so corrupted that it can no longer respond to ordinary people’s needs has provoked a demagogic backlash that in some countries begins to slide into fascism. But despite years of revelations about hidden spending, fake news, front groups and micro-targeted ads on social media, almost nothing has changed.In Britain, for example, we now know that the EU referendum was won with the help of widespread cheating. We still don’t know the origins of much of the money spent by the leave campaigns. For example, we have no idea who provided the £435,000 channelled through Scotland, into Northern Ireland, through the coffers of the Democratic Unionist party and back into Scotland and England, to pay for pro-Brexit ads. Nor do we know the original source of the £8m that Arron Banks delivered to the Leave.EU campaign. We do know that both of the main leave campaigns have been fined for illegal activities, and that the conduct of the referendum has damaged many people’s faith in the political system. But, astonishingly, the government has so far failed to introduce a single new law in response to these events. And now it’s happening again.Since mid-January an organisation called Britain’s Future has spent £125,000 on Facebook ads demanding a hard or no-deal Brexit. Most of them target particular constituencies. Where an MP is deemed sympathetic to the organisation’s aims, the voters who receive these ads are urged to tell him or her to “remove the backstop, rule out a customs union, deliver Brexit without delay”. Where the MP is deemed unsympathetic, the message is: “Don’t let them steal Brexit Don’t let them ignore your vote.”So who or what is Britain’s Future? Sorry, I have no idea. As openDemocracy points out, it has no published address and releases no information about who founded it, who controls it and who has been paying for these advertisements. The only person publicly associated with it is a journalist called Tim Dawson, who edits its website. Dawson has not yet replied to the questions I have sent him. It is, in other words, highly opaque. The anti-Brexit campaigns are not much better. People’s Vote and Best for Britain have also been spending heavily on Facebook ads, though not as much in recent weeks as Britain’s Future.At least we know who is involved in these remain campaigns and where they are based, but both refuse to reveal their full sources of funding. People’s Vote says “the majority of our funding comes from small donors”. It also receives larger donations but says “it’s a matter for the donors if they want to go public”. Best for Britain says that some of its funders want to remain anonymous, and “we understand that”. But it seems to me that that transparent and accountable campaigns would identify anyone paying more than a certain amount (perhaps £1,000). If people don’t want to be named, they shouldn’t use their money to influence our politics. Both campaigns insist that they abide by the rules governing funding for political parties, elections and referendums.As they must know better than most, the rules on such spending are next to useless. They were last redrafted 19 years ago, when online campaigning had scarcely begun. It’s as if current traffic regulations insisted only that you water your horses every few hours and check the struts on your cartwheels for woodworm. The Electoral Commission has none of the powers required to regulate online campaigning or to extract information from companies such as Facebook. Nor does it have the power to determine the original sources of money spent on political campaigns. So it is unable to tell whether or not the law that says funders must be based in the UK has been broken. The maximum fines it can levy are pathetic: £20,000 for each offence. That’s a small price to pay for winning an election.Since 2003, the commission has been asking, with an ever greater sense of urgency, for basic changes in the law. But it has been stonewalled by successive governments. The exposés of Carole Cadwalladr, the , openDemocracy and Channel 4 News about the conduct of the referendum have so far made no meaningful difference to government policy. We have local elections in May and there could be a general election at any time. The old, defunct rules still apply.Our politicians have instead left it to Facebook to do the right thing. Which is, shall we say, an unreliable strategy. In response to the public outcry, Facebook now insists that organisations placing political ads provide it (but not us) with a contact based in the UK. Since October, it has archived their advertisements and the amount they spend. But there is no requirement that its advertisers reveal who provides the funding. An organisation’s name means nothing if the organisation is opaque. The way Facebook presents the data makes it impossible to determine spending trends, unless you check the entries every week. And its new rules apply only in the US, the UK and Brazil. In the rest of the world, it remains a regulatory black hole.So why won’t the government act? Partly because, regardless of the corrosive impacts on public life, it wants to keep the system as it is. The current rules favour the parties with the most money to spend, which tends to mean the parties that appeal to the rich. But mostly, I think, it’s because, like other governments, it has become institutionally incapable of responding to our emergencies. It won’t rescue democracy because it can’t. The system in which it is embedded seems destined to escalate rather than dampen disasters.Ecologically, economically and politically, capitalism is failing as catastrophically as communism failed. Like state communism, it is beset by unacknowledged but fatal contradictions. It is inherently corrupt and corrupting. But its mesmerising power, and the vast infrastructure of thought that seeks to justify it, makes any challenge to the model almost impossible to contemplate. Even to acknowledge the emergencies it causes, let alone to act on them, feels like electoral suicide. As the famous saying goes: “It is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism.” Our urgent task is to turn this the other way round."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5037e2e7e1b723ad3f819514b02005856f6502f3/0_213_5236_3142/master/5236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdd6d38763ce1329fffad77c94759336","title":"the surprising truth about brexit britain were a country full of moderates","story":"There are plenty of thoughtful, pragmatic remainers and leavers. They’re just not getting any airtimeBrexit has ided Britain – everyone says so. Families have been fractured, friendships blighted. Fury – yes, fury – hangs heavy in the air. Well, maybe. Perhaps it’s just the furious – the politicians, the punters, the pundits – who are getting all the airtime.Just after the referendum I made a Panorama documentary in the West Midlands asking people why they had voted the way they had. The leavers, the majority, thumped their tubs in triumph. The remainers hung their heads in despair at the simple-mindedness of the leavers. Standard stuff.Two and a half years later, for Radio 4, I went back to speak to some of the same people. Having been told – and even blithely said myself – that we were all at war with ourselves, I prepared for the worst. My interviewees’ positions would surely have hardened.But I didn’t need my political flak jacket at all. All but one of the leavers were studies in pragmatic moderation. They still wanted to leave, somehow, but understood it was more complicated than they had been led to believe, and immigration issues weren’t so easy to sort after all, and so on. And surely we could muddle our way through it.The remainers – even more encouragingly, to my mind – weren’t giving it the old I-told-you-so. One of them said: “I think I understand better now why leavers voted leave perhaps there might now be more understanding all around and some good could come out of this.”The sobering thing for me was the realisation that I only heard these moderate voices because I was stuck with them – this being the whole point of the programme, to go back to those I had heard from before. In the normal run of things they wouldn’t have made the cut and they would never have got on air. What good is a moderate, considered voice in a news vox pop? If I had been doing a radio phone-in and one of this lot had been put through to me, I’d be mouthing annoyance through the glass at my producer, asking what they were playing at.All power to the meek, the mild and the moderate: one day you shall inherit the Earth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d99d12c21d57e8e6aaf345bd18df93c7a70d7858/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7aa2624af50eb97b3e165d8e19a7ab22","title":"vice chancellors pay universities england 2017 18","story":"First survey of senior staff pay also shows nearly half of vice-chancellors paid over £300,000Six universities in England paid their vice-chancellors £500,000 or more in salary, bonuses and benefits last year, while nearly half of all VCs received more than £300,000, according to the higher education regulator’s first survey of senior staff pay.The Open University, London Business School and the University of East London topped the table for leaders’ remuneration, with the OU paying out £718,000 in 2017-18, including compensation for loss of office, to its departed vice-chancellor Peter Horrocks.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said it was wrong that vice-chancellors’ pay was growing while frontline staff faced real-terms pay cuts and students had mounting debts.“This is just another result of the Tories’ failed free-market experiment in higher education. There is no sign that the government will take serious action to tackle the endemic inequality in our universities,” Rayner said.Dominic Shellard, vice-chancellor since 2010, is stepping down for undisclosed reasons. His departure coincides with an investigation by the Office for Students (OfS) watchdog over “regulatory matters”.Reading has reported itself to the OfS and Charity Commission over the lucrative sale of land worth £121m belonging to a trust controlled by the university. Sir David Bell, Reading’s VC when the land sales took place, stepped down at the end of last summer and moved to Sunderland University. Reading has yet to name a replacement.The university badly mishandled a disciplinary case against male students who used an online group chat to discuss raping women on campus. Two of the men were given 10-year bans from Warwick two others received one-year bans. But after an appeal the university cut the 10-year bans to just a year each. Eventually the two men opted not to return to Warwick.In November Swansea announced the suspension of its vice-chancellor, Prof Richard Davies, and three other senior staff members but refused to say why, leaving even their colleagues unable to explain what was going on. Davies denies any wrongdoing. A number of issues have slowly emerged, thanks to dogged reporting by Wales Online, including the university’s involvement in a £600m joint venture for a private university in Kuwait and a £200m project for a “wellness village” in Carmarthenshire. Davies’s suspension came despite his impending retirement after 17 years in the post.At the start of the academic year LJMU abruptly announced that its vice-chancellor, Prof Nigel Weatherill, was to step down “with immediate effect” after seven years in the post. The university said the decision followed “discussions between the board of governors and the vice-chancellor”.The University and College Union said the continued rise in pay showed the new universities regulator, launched in England last year, was a “paper tiger” that had failed to halt the increase in wealth being transferred to senior management.“The OfS fails to ask why some vice-chancellors are still picking up double-digit pay rises and doesn’t even look at their expenses or other benefits in kind. This report sends a message that those who accept such largesse have nothing to fear from the new regulator,” said Matt Waddup, UCU’s head of policy.Waddup noted that Nicola Dandridge, the OfS’s chief executive, told MPs last year that universities would have to justify executive pay above £150,000. But, he noted, only four out of 133 institutions paid their vice-chancellors less than £150,000.“With this lightweight report the OfS has shown itself to be a paper tiger incapable of stopping the pay and perks scandals that have plagued universities,” Waddup said.Dandridge defended the regulator’s approach. “It is not for the Office for Students to set a vice-chancellor’s pay. We understand that running a university is a significant and complex task, and it is right that those who excel in their roles should be well rewarded,” she said.“Despite this, where pay is out of kilter, or salary increases at the top outstrip pay awards to other staff, vice-chancellors should be prepared to answer tough questions from their staff, student bodies and the public.”He said the regulator may need to take action. “We have given the OfS powers to take action if universities do not do this and we expect them to be used where necessary.”It is a sensitive time for the institutions involved, as they face a potential financial hit. A review of tertiary education funding is expected to suggest cutting annual undergraduate tuition fees in England from £9,250 to less than £7,000 a student.If carried out, without substantial replacement funding from the Treasury, the sector would lose a substantial portion of the income that many rely upon after years of rapid expansion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b72a75f26de1130eac3446edc7651aee3e0ef27/0_391_5834_3501/master/5834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35449bf0c421b8592eeb9ea7bda6e228","title":"wildlife photographer year people choice winner in pictures","story":"David Lloyd’s Bond of Brothers, a heartwarming image of an affectionate pair of male lions, has been crowned the winner of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Lumix people’s choice award.

This jewel is inspired by his own upbringing in early 1970s Mexico City, and his family’s complex relationship with their beloved live-in maid. The film’s engagement with race, culture and class together with its staggeringly choreographed setpieces and sublimely inspired incidental detail all come together with Yalitza Aparicio’s wonderful lead performance to weave a spell.Part of it is Cuarón’s miraculously unforced narrative flow. So many movies look like they have come out of screenplay-seminar thinking: three acts, show-don’t-tell, character arc, obstacles surmounted, life-lessons learned. By contrast, Roma just spills out unhurriedly on to the screen, moving this way and that, like the water being patiently sploshed by the maid Cleo on to the tiled driveway under the film’s opening credits. It has an inspired fluency, uncoerced, unmanaged, full of digressive ease.In its way, this is a very novelistic film, with the accretion of detail you might expect from a Bildungsroman. The experiences of Aparicio’s maidservant character Cleo do not take her on anything as explicit as a personal “journey”, but something more mysterious and internalised. We see what Cleo sees, we wonder what and how she feels, we build up our investment of sympathy with her, and it all leads to a heartrending payoff. I have still never seen the climactic scene clearly – having been semi-blinded by tears each time.Cleo is a young woman of Mesoamerican heritage working as a live-in maid for a beleaguered upper-middle-class family in Mexico City. Cleo’s personal life is beginning to disintegrate alongside that of her employer, Sofía (Marina De Tavira), mother to four lively kids — though it’s Cleo who has to do the childcare heavy lifting. Cuarón shows, through a hundred little touches, that though their handsomely appointed household is superficially comfortable, the family is, in Tolstoy’s words, unhappy in its own way. The father, Antonio (Fernando Grediaga), is increasingly late home, parks his car with fanatical precision in the driveway in a way that hints at dysfunction and repressed anxiety. Soon he is away on what Sofia tells the children is a business trip but tearfully asks them to write letters to their papa begging him to come home. Meanwhile, Cleo forms a relationship with a dodgy martial-arts enthusiast, Fermín (Jorge Antonio Guerrero) who is less than supportive when she explains she has missed her period.There are some amazing and almost dreamlike scenes in the film, left-field adventures which never look extraneous, but like the things that can happen in real, rather than surreal life: a family trip to friends in the country featuring a hair-raising shooting trip, a New Year’s party which culminates in a forest fire and one guest singing an earnest Scandinavian hymn. Fermín demonstrates his martial arts moves to Cleo in a postcoital display of self-love. Cleo later tracks him down to a weird outdoor paramilitary motivational meeting outside town. Cuarón’s finds these moments with serendipitous inspiration, and his Mexico City streetscapes are sensational, thrillingly alive, worthy of Scorsese, especially in the evocation of the Corpus Christi massacre, when around 120 people were killed by the military during a student demonstration, and which here has a sensational personal significance. Cuarón’s own superb monochrome cinematography reminded me of Michael Chapman’s work on Raging Bull.It is all heading to Cleo’s own terrifying moment of truth, to the revelation about her love for the four children under her care: what she has done for them, what she has sacrificed for them, and what life has given and taken from her. There is a quiet grandeur in these scenes. With quiet dignity, she is the moral equal of everyone she meets: the children she cares for, the woman who employs her, the doctor who treats her. That is her victory. What a wonderful movie it is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

Ole Gunnar Solskjær has passed every other test with distinction. Not here, though. Outscored, outpassed and outsung – their night culminated with a red card for Paul Pogba and it will need something remarkable if they can save themselves in the return leg at Parc des Princes.In reality, who can really see them pulling off that kind of feat of escapology on the evidence of this tie? Paris Saint-Germain took a while to realise they were the superior side but once they seized control, it must have been startling for Solskjær to see the way his team lapsed into bad habits. If anything, PSG had enough chances to win even more convincingly, whereas it was difficult to remember a single moment when Gianluigi Buffon was seriously endangered. To describe United’s performance as six out of 10 would be generous.Instead it was the first time in United’s long history of European competitions, going back to the 1956-57 season under Matt Busby, that they have lost a home game by more than one goal. Solskjær sounded confident they will put in a much-improved performance when the sides renew acquaintances on 6 March. The same might apply to PSG bearing in mind Thomas Tuchel was visibly aggrieved by his team’s first-half display.That, perhaps, is the scariest thought for the side who finished with 10 men: PSG, with 103 goals in 35 matches this season, can be even more dangerous at their own place, with the backing of their vociferous supporters.The goals arrived in a seven-minute spell during a second half when Kylian Mbappé delivered the kind of performance that was beyond Marcus Rashford, one of several disappointing performers for the home team, and Ángel Di María reminded Old Trafford why there was once a time when United valued him highly enough to make him the club’s record signing.Di María is not remembered fondly, as demonstrated by the sight of a plastic bottle landing near his feet in the second half, or the crowd’s malicious delight earlier in the match when Ashley Young sent him flying into the perimeter fence. Early on, Di María’s occasional carelessness must have reminded the home supporters about some of the Argentinian’s more undistinguished performances in United’s colours.By the end, however, he had played a key role in both goals, swinging over the corner from which Presnel Kimpembe volleyed in the opening goal, then putting in the decisive pass for Mbappé to accelerate into a gap between Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelöf and score with a show of phenomenal speed and centre-forward awareness.By that stage Mbappé had already demonstrated what everyone should probably have known anyway: that he would have no trouble out-sprinting either of United’s centre-halves, even when his opponents had a head start. Marquinhos had subdued Pogba with a brilliantly efficient man-marking role and United had lost Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard to injury, meaning the introduction of Alexis Sánchez and Juan Mata. That deprived United of the speed Solskjær wants in wide attacking areas, although the truth is the two injured players had found it difficult to make any positive impact during their time on the pitch.The most revealing statistic at half-time, with only five efforts at goal, was that no other game in this season’s Champions League had witnessed fewer first-half shots. Solskjær must have dearly wanted an improvement but it was PSG who suddenly clicked and for the rest of the game the Ligue 1 leaders played as though affronted by the suggestion that the absence of Neymar and Edinson Cavani had to be a debilitating setback.Perhaps they had a bit of good fortune, too, because a reasonable argument could be made that Kimpembe should not have been on the pitch for the opening goal, having been booked for one foul on Martial and putting in a couple of risky challenges on Lingard and Rashford that might have warranted a second yellow card.In the 53rd minute, David de Gea turned Mbappé’s downward header round a post for a corner. Di María whipped the ball into the penalty area and Nemanja Matic, the nearest player to Kimpembe, seemed to think De Gea would come off his line to collect it. He didn’t – and Kimpembe’s volley flew into the roof of the net.After that PSG went for the kill and on the hour-mark the ball went forward through Juan Bernat and Di María again. This time the attack had originated with Marquinhos dispossessing Pogba in the other half of the pitch. Di María’s delivery from the left was weighted perfectly and Mbappé’s acceleration did the rest, coupled with his utter determination to make sure he reached the ball ahead of Bailly and Lindelöf, then clipping a shot past De Gea without breaking stride.For Solskjær the most alarming part was United’s lack of creativity. This was the first time, perhaps surprisingly, Buffon has ever faced United at Old Trafford and the only troubling moment for the goalkeeper was an early kick that he misdirected out of play. Pogba, already booked from the first half, had been irritated by a foul from Dani Alves and the next time the ball came between the two players he went in studs-high. It was a challenge laced with frustration.The referee, Daniele Orsato, reached for his yellow card on 10 separate occasions. Pogba’s were number three and nine and he will not be playing in Paris when, barring an incredible comeback, United’s participation in the Champions League will draw to a close."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbfdb6f299622ae5932cc47ea8740dbab73018ca/91_102_2526_1516/master/2526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea5f8bee2d74278db50768a82670cbf0","title":"paul scholes oldham yeovil league two one championship roundup","story":"Paul Scholes enjoyed a winning start to his managerial career as his Oldham side ran out 4-1 winners in the League Two match against Yeovil at Boundary Park.The 44-year-old former Manchester United and England midfielder took charge on Monday and Oldham produced the required response on the pitch as Jose Baxter put them in front during first-half stoppage time. Callum Lang headed home early in the second half before Bevis Mugabi pulled a goal back on 54 minutes following a free-kick.Mohamed Maouche put the result beyond doubt on 88 minutes, and there was still time for Christopher Missilou to volley in a fourth. “It’s a relief and I may get some sleep tonight,” said Scholes, who lives just a few minutes’ drive from his boyhood club. “It was a tough night and not really a 4-1 game but I was proud with the way they battledAt 2-0 the Latics looked comfortable but once they conceded, within three minutes of doubling their lead, the game was in the balance until two late, long-range shots put a gloss on the scoreline. “That’s what I want. I want them to express themselves and enjoy themselves. Fans want entertainment and that’s what we gave them,” Scholes added. “It’s a place I’ve come as a fan and I know you excite them when you entertain them.”Victory lifted Oldham to 11th, six points from the play-offs, with two home matches to come. “There’s a chance of the play-offs but I’m not looking far ahead,” he added. “We’ll look at Crewe first on Saturday. I knew there was talent in the side and they’ve shown it.”Chuks Aneke came off the bench to score a late winner as MK Dons boosted their play-off hopes with a 1-0 win at Newport. The former Arsenal youngster struck with two minutes left, lifting the Dons up to fourth and four points off second-placed Bury.Forest Green Rovers saw their play-off push dented with a 2-0 defeat at Swindon, a second loss in the space of four days. Kaiyne Woolery broke the deadlock on 36 minutes after being set up by Theo Robinson with the on-loan Southend striker – making his home debut – then on the scoresheet himself just before half-time.Carlisle’s play-off hopes were also dealt a blow with a 2-1 loss at Crewe. The Railwaymen raced into an early lead when Chris Porter scored from close range after three minutes. The visitors were then reduced to 10 men when Jamie Devitt was shown a straight red card following a clash with Perry Ng. Although Gary Miller equalised, Crewe made their advantage count when the substitute Shaun Miller grabbed what proved to be the winner with 17 minutes remaining.Doncaster gave themselves a cushion in the League One play-off places with a comfortable 3-0 win against Southend at the Keepmoat.Apart from an opening 10-minute spell, Rovers were totally dominant and went ahead when John Marquis headed in his 22nd of the season. Further goal from Mallik Wilks and Herbie Kane in the second half sealed the victory and saw Doncaster open up a four-point lead over Peterborough in seventh spot.Sunderland stay fourth but needed a late Jack Baldwin header to earn a 1-1 draw at the Stadium of Light against Blackpool, who led through Armand Gnanduillet’s effort.AFC Wimbledon kept their survival hopes alive with a 1-0 victory at Walsall where Steve Seddon scored the only goal shortly after half-time. The Dons are still bottom and seven points adrift of safety, however.In the Championship, Jay Rodriguez’s controversial late penalty rescued a point for West Brom against Nottingham Forest. The striker’s 17th goal of the season secured a 2-2 draw after Dwight Gayle’s theatrical tumble in the area.Ryan Yates’ first Forest goal looked to have put the visitors on course for victory midway through the second half. Jacob Murphy’s first goal in over a year had initially hauled Albion level after Stefan Johansen’s early own goal. The Baggies remain fourth while ninth-placed Forest slipped five points behind the top six in their quest to end a 20-year Premier League exile.Famara Diedhiou scored an injury time penalty to give Bristol City a 2-1 win over QPR at Ashton Gate and extend their winning run to nine games. The visitors went in front just before the interval when a header from Nahki Wells came back off a post and presented Matt Smith with a tap-in.But Niclas Eliasson levelled for City in the 73rd minute, accepting a Jamie Paterson pass and cutting in from the right to bury a left-foot shot from just inside the box. Diedhiou settled the outcome at the start of five minutes of stoppage time. Having been fouled by Darnell Furlong, the big striker got up to score with a powerful spot-kick.Phil Parkinson praised Bolton’s spirit after Callum Connolly’s header gave them a first win in eight Championship games, a 1-0 victory at Birmingham.The 21-year-old was shown a yellow card for only one of two late challenges in as many second-half minutes at St Andrew’s before heading the only goal of the soon after. The dreary contest was short of quality and chances but the visitors were deservedly rewarded for a gutsy and disciplined display.Sheffield Wednesday continued their unbeaten start under Steve Bruce as they played out a 0-0 draw against Millwall at the Den. The home side failed to score for the third home league game in a row despite having more than their share of the few chances as Wednesday continued their run of not conceding under the new manager.Rotherham moved two points clear of the relegation zone after a rousing second-half comeback secured a 2-2 draw at Hull. Jarrod Bowen and Fraizer Campbell, with their 16th and 10th goals of the season respectively, fired the Tigers into a 2-0 half-time lead but Paul Warne changed the game with his substitutions, bringing on Anthony Forde and Jon Taylor for the Millers.Forde gave them hope by pouncing on a mistake from David Marshall following good work from Taylor, who then saw a shot deflected in to level the scores in the 55th minute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/019d30688822d9b13345cada9129fe6d7cca5e7d/0_145_2626_1575/master/2626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=697c8737232ee2a19f872490a20e50c3","title":"kylian mbappe teleportation device manchester united floundering","story":"PSG forward shows his repertoire of speed and skill, including scoring the second goal that may have already ended the tieFor all the complexities of elite sport, some things don’t change. In his novel End Zone, Don DeLillo obsesses about the speed of NFL running backs. “Speed is the last excitement left,” he writes. “The one thing we haven’t used up, still naked in its potential.”In which case DeLillo could do a lot worse than have a peek at Kylian Mbappé, who glided around the edges at Old Trafford for half an hour who scored a decisive second-half goal and who by the end had provided some moments of exhilaration so natural and easy in among the collisions you could almost feel the stadium goggling each time he began to glide away.United were poor here, beaten 2-0 by a superior team with a beautifully grooved midfield. Plus, of course, in Mbappé Paris Saint-Germain have the best young attacking player in the world, a talent that thrilled this grand old stage even in chastening defeat.It had been difficult before this game not to make the obvious comparison, to set Mbappé and Marcus Rashford and against one another. Not just as fine young attacking talents but as similar players of similar ages, with similar burdens of hope to carry.It is a fairly pointless exercise. Rashford is an excellent player. Mbappé, though, is something else, a footballer who seems to have an extra gear even among the best, capable of producing moments that make the day seem to stop and bend at the edges, making other high-class footballers look suddenly gauche and lost, spectators at his show.From the start there was the usual double-take just watching him move. Lots of players are quick. Mbappé appears to have some kind of teleportation device in his socks, a superior relationship with space, speed that comes from perfect timing and an unusual elasticity.Speed is, of course, nothing without craft and timing. In Mbappé-Verratti, PSG had the air of a champion boxer: wearing you down with the jab, stretching your patience with those crafty inside movements, then knocking you dead with the straight right when your guard is worn away.It was around the half-hour mark that Mbappé began to find his range, dragging the United defence deeper, causing panic ripples with each touch of the ball.First there was a blur of a sprint in behind Luke Shaw. Then came an amazing miss from six yards out, the chance created by a lovely little pass from Julian Draxler. Next Mbappé gave Ashley Young 20 yards then spirited across in front of him like a malevolent white-shirted ghost, drawing a desperate foul.Old Trafford had been a lovely spectacle at kick-off under those cold white lights, the full house snaking right up into the eaves of this clanky old metal enormo-drome. PSG may be a state-funded superstar vehicle but one of the joys of this club is their supporters, who bring noise and pageantry wherever they go.Here the blue and red corner bounced and set off its flares before kick-off, cloaking the pitch in a theatrical fug of thin white smoke.PSG sits on the most potent talent factory in world football, the Paris banlieues. But United began with two Parisians in their XI to just one for PSG, Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial versus a single Mbappé. Although it must be said, sometimes a single Mbappé is all you need.From the start United pressed hard and high. Marquinhos took the idea of man-marking Pogba to the most thrillingly literal-minded extreme, not just following him around but mirroring every one of his steps, like a brilliantly slick provincial ballroom dance duo.It worked, though. Pogba was strangled out of this game, unable to find the spaces he needs. Towards the end he was sent off for a second yellow born out of frustration at chasing the game, and above all chasing Verratti, the master of the spin and turn and the short nudged pass. The second half began the same way, the white shirts passing and moving, sucking United into uncomfortable shapes. And within 15 minutes the game had been taken away with surgical brilliance.First David de Gea palmed Mbappé’s powerful downward header away for a corner. Ángel Di María’s kick was turned in by Presnel Kimpembe, charging through unmarked to the goal-line.Then came Mbappé’s highlights-reel moment. As Di María hared away down the left, there was another sight of that pure, exhilarating acceleration, Mbappé seeming to ramp himself up like a cartoon rooster whirling its legs in a cloud of dust, then easing in between the defenders and finding the perfect little pocket of space. The cross was just right, the finish on the run high class, Mbappé rolling the ball across goal and into the corner. In the process he may well have killed this tie stone dead.United’s midfield will not be the last outfoxed by Verratti, PSG’s own high-class passing goblin, who took the ball away and made it his own for 90 minutes. Similarly there is no disgrace in being cut open by Mbappé, whose movement here was matched by his fearlessness, the cold hard certainty of a player operating at a different level, a different speed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/befc370b2b4cf5813adc36d3564e9cd34e260fc3/0_203_2228_1337/master/2228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84f3021f970620f0e2937059d4b2762e","title":"gordon banks a life in pictures","story":"England’s 1966 World Cup-winning goalkeeper has died aged 81.

It is linked to a previous address, and the missed payments were made after I moved out.The issue arose when my bank reduced my credit card limit saying my credit report with Callcredit gave it cause for concern. The records are clearly erroneous as they contain different spellings of my name and a different date of birth. I complained to Noddle, Callcredit’s credit report checker, which told me the mail order company would not remove the file reference. I then complained to Callcredit which accepted its data was incorrect and promised to correct my file. I then received a letter at my current address from a debt collection agency. I can only assume Callcredit gave it my details. How can business and credit agencies be so lax in their use of data and effectively cause harassment and financial loss to a person who has done nothing wrong? Most of us are only dimly aware of credit reference agencies, but these multimillion-pound companies document and rate our spending habits in exhaustive detail. Financial services, from mortgage lenders to mobile phone companies, pay to access this information and use it to decide whether a customer is likely to pay their debts. Often consumers only discover this when they are turned down for a loan. When an error is acknowledged, it can take up to 28 days to correct.TransUnion (formerly Callcredit) declines to comment on your case but says it receives hundreds of millions of personal data records each month and tries to ensure they are all matched to the correct person.“In very rare instances, our data-matching routine may not allocate the data correctly,” it says. “If we find there has been an error either in the data supplied, or in the manner of its allocation, we will arrange a correction and for files to be updated.”According to the regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office, credit reference agencies are allowed to share an inidual’s information with a company trying to trace a vanished debtor.If a mis-trace happens because a credit reference agency holds incorrect details, or a creditor is searching for someone with an identical or similar name, the company should only make “tentative” approaches and carry out further checks to confirm the identity of the person.If a credit reference agency or a financial organisation does not resolve a reported error satisfactorily, you can report them to the ICO and seek to enforce your rights through the courts. In the meantime, do keep checking your credit record so you don’t discover a mistake only after you’ve been refused credit.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

I’ve got every single release, including the original 1987 12in of I Owe You Nothing, which wasn’t a hit – I found it in the basement of Debenhams in Wigan a couple of years later and I cried. Every time they were on TV, I’d be ready with the remote control so I could record them, and I’d watch each appearance on a loop.Five years ago, I found out that Matt Goss was coming to do a signing at HMV in Manchester. For the week before, I was transported back to being a 15-year-old. I was so excited that I was finally going to meet him, I decided I was going to get his autograph and have it tattooed on. It would be on the back of my leg, so no one would see it, but I would know it was there. It would be a permanent memory. It was also poignant for me when I first adored Bros, when I was 14 or 15, my mum and dad had just got orced, and it sounds like a cliche, but music – not just Bros – got me through a really difficult time. Having the tattoo was like marking the occasion.Matt was very gracious at that signing he spent so much time with everybody. He was very insistent about where he should put his autograph, and then he gave me advice about how to have it tattooed, none of which I remembered. When I got home, I showed it to my partner, Gavin, and told him about my plan. He thought it was hilarious. I got the tattoo done two days later. In the meantime, I covered the autograph with sticky tape to make sure it didn’t come off in the shower. When I peeled off the tape – I don’t know anything about the physics of ink and sticky tape – I was just thinking, “Please don’t let the tape peel the ink off.” I went into a tattooist on the way home from work and it took 20 minutes and cost £60. I’ve never regretted it.Matt Hemley, 39, theatre journalist from LondonMy partner jokes that I have Gloria Estefan locked in a cupboard. Thankfully, I have the self-awareness to know that my flat shouldn’t be dominated by her, so most of my collection is in boxes.I’ve got her music on every format – CDs, tapes and LPs, although when I was a teenager the LPs just decorated my walls because I didn’t have a record player. My whole room was taken up with her. And her label was good at sending stuff if you wrote in – a courier once arrived with billboard posters and a lifesize standup cutout figure of her. That came to university with me, and my housemates would decorate her every Halloween. Nowadays, I just keep a few signed photos out in frames, and if I’m home alone I’ll watch one of her concerts on DVD. I never get bored with singing along.It began when I was 11. My dad had heard her song Go Away, and he wanted it for his birthday. I bought it for him, but I loved it and I pinched it, and I’ve loved her ever since. I loved the vibrancy of her music, and its uplifting nature. I was a gay teen and there was something very comforting about it.Twelve years ago, I was working for Broadcast magazine, covering radio. I found out that she was going in to LBC, so I contacted the PR, asking if I could come in and say hello, and they arranged for me to sit in on an hour-long interview. I gave her a Christmas pudding because I thought that was something she would never have had in Cuba, where she’s from. Last summer, I was invited to dinner in London with her, and she told everyone about the Christmas pudding. I was amazed she remembered.Then, when Twitter launched, I started following her, and after a few tweets she realised who I was and followed me back. Every year on my birthday she sends me a direct message, and they have become more and more personal. But I think my favourite memory is from 2015, when I went to the opening night of the musical about her life, On Your Feet!, on Broadway. I knew she would be there, so at the interval, I looked to see what room she would go into. When the second act began, she didn’t come out immediately, so I made my way over. When she came out, I approached her. Her bodyguards came forward, but she said: “I know this person. How are you, Matt?” I don’t think I’ve ever felt so proud.Melissa Holmes, 42, web developer from DerbyshireI’m hearing-impaired, but that doesn’t stop me enjoying Bon Jovi’s music and melody. I have listened to the CDs hundreds of times. Live shows can be a little frustrating, however because, although I can follow along when they play, when Jon Bon Jovi tells stories or gives little speeches those can be difficult, if not impossible, to understand. I was at Giants Stadium in New Jersey and Jon gave some kind of thank-you speech near the end of the show, and whatever he said had some fans in tears. Everyone was talking about it afterwards, but I’d hardly made out a word.I’ve arrived at venues anything up to 32 hours beforehand to try to get front row sometimes with sleeping bags and tents, sometimes not – we started with tents in 2006, I think. Before then, everyone just sat out. I’ve been threatened (along with other fans) with having the cops called on me in the US when we wanted to camp out before a show. Luckily, it got resolved, and we camped – and we got front row.Iain Lee, 45, broadcaster from LondonSeeing the Monkees live for the first time in 1989 was amazing. It was spiritual. It was joy and ecstasy unlike anything else. For a 15-year-old, it was a little bit sexy. Despite the mullet he had at the time, Davy Jones was a sexually attractive man, and, I’m going to say it, I fancied him.It had all started with the TV show – 9.25 in the morning during the school holidays. Some people have their Bowie moment – when they saw him on Top of the Pops doing Starman – but mine was seeing the Monkees mime Valleri. Shit! This is it, man!I went to Our Price in the Queensmere shopping centre in Slough to buy a greatest hits album, but they had two: one double, and one with a couple of new songs. I didn’t have enough money for both of them, so I went to the fountain they’d just installed outside the shopping centre – which was normally filled with bubbles from people putting washing-up liquid in – and I stole the extra £2.50 I needed. That was the first sign of obsession: stealing to feed my habit.Since then, I’ve probably spent £200,000 to £250,000 on the Monkees – on buying things, on travelling to see them, and on setting up 7a Records to release really obscure Monkees records and solo material. The label is a very expensive hobby, but we do it to make the records I want in my collection that don’t actually exist. And the spending started early: at 14, I was convincing my mum to write out international money orders for £100, which I’d send to the US, and then six months later I’d get some really shitty-quality live bootlegs back.The single most expensive thing I’ve got is a 1967 Monkees Gretsch guitar, which cost about £3,500. I wouldn’t say that ended my marriage, but it didn’t go down particularly well with my wife.Beth Nabi, 40, university professor from Jacksonville, FloridaI’ve seen U2 73 times in 10 countries since the first time in 1997, and even found an opportunity to merge my love of the band with my academic research.I teach graphic design and digital media, and I had been studying U2’s visual identity as a fan. I went to Vancouver for the start of their 2015 tour – everyone goes out early to hang around the rehearsals, so there’s this great community – and I noticed lots of the people had U2 tattoos, and it hit me: I wanted to capture this. I wanted to know what marks they put on their bodies and why. From then on, I documented the fans in line. I would interview them and document them, asking: “What does this band mean to you that you have them on your body?” And now the U2 Tattoo Project has had an exhibit in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. And it has been on the U2 official site, which was mind-blowing. As a fan: holy shit! Bono may know my name! For any fan to have their idol aware of them is sublime.In 2017, when they toured playing The Joshua Tree in full, I wanted to work the U2 Tattoo Project in Europe, and see what the fan culture was like in those cities. I try not to think about how much that cost – the first rule of fandom is don’t look at your bank account. I went to every city for every show, but the night of the second Rome show, I had been talking to fans all day, I was exhausted from the heat, and I was overwhelmed and I needed a break. I sold my ticket to another fan and I walked around the city. I went to the Colosseum instead of going to see U2. It was a huge moment: I have a ticket and I’m walking away. It was big step in my development: I came, I saw, I conquered.Sindy Grewal, 54, executive coach from LondonI grew up in a traditional Asian family, and teenage girls weren’t really allowed to go to concerts. I wanted to see Springsteen on the River tour in 1981, but none of my siblings would go with me, so I couldn’t go. However, my mother bought me a ticket to see him at Wembley on the Born in the USA tour in 1985. I was overwhelmed, and I cried when he did Independence Day. I’ve now seen him well over 50 times, although that isn’t much compared with lots of superfans, but my friends know I’ll cry if he does Thunder Road, especially the acoustic version.For me, the important things are the live shows. I’m not a collector. I don’t have every edition of everything that has come out. I don’t have 15 versions of the same album. I’ve never really got that. Instead, I travel to see him because I feel that he’s different in different places: there’s something about the way he relates to each different audience. Seeing him at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, his home state, with his people, had a real sense of community. When I saw him in Australia, because it was such a long time since he’d played there, there was the sheer enthusiasm of everyone. Pittsburgh was unusual because so many of his songs are about places like that – the Johnstown Company, which is mentioned in The River, is in Pittsburgh. I have to keep going to see him because I keep thinking he may not be playing much longer: I may never see him again, if he decides to stop touring.Janie Burden, 34, music promoter from SomersetI suppose my strangest piece of memorabilia is a piece of carpet from HMV in Manchester. It was in 2006, when Take That did a signing there. A group of us camped outside the night before – it was so cold in hindsight we should have taken a Thermos and some sandwiches – because it was a big adventure. After the signing, some staff came out with bits of carpet, and they said it was the carpet Take That had been standing on. No clue about which member had stood on it, or even if really the soles of their shoes had just brushed it. It lived in the boot of my car for a while because I wasn’t sure what to do with it. Every time people saw if, they would ask why I had a piece of carpet in the boot, and I’d tell them someone from Take That might have stood on it. They’d look at me and say: “Oh. OK.”I first got into them through my older sister – I was six and she was 18 – but it was when they reformed in 2005 that I became a superfan. They were my first band, they were back and I was the right age. I started camping out because I wanted to meet all of them.The most memorable meeting was when Robbie Williams rejoined in 2010 and they did a Radio 1 live lounge appearance. In the early 90s, they had brought out a set of Take That dolls – you can see who they’re meant to be, but they don’t really look like the members – and I got a set, although they sold out really quickly. My sister told me: “Don’t you dare ever take them out of their boxes.” So at Radio 1, it wasn’t just that I got to see all five of them together again, but I also got Robbie to sign my doll. And now I’ve got all five of them in their boxes, signed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b347cbf0236da29cb3581d5e45fcc140fceb1de9/0_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d18844848b79d1be00a73e7e1c882fd","title":"a week at guantanamo bay today in focus podcast","story":"’s Julian Borger recently spent a week at the Guantánamo Bay detention facility, attending the 33rd pre-trial hearing of five 911 suspects.

Now Brexit is threatening to split his party, and many of his MPs and party members feel frustrated by his lack of clarity over the party’s position on Europe. ’s political editor, Heather Stewart, talks to Anushka Asthana about Corbyn’s changing relationship with the EU, while Steve Howell, a former Corbyn adviser and author of Game Changer: Eight Weeks That Transformed British Politics, discusses how Corbyn arrived at his remain and reform position. Plus Alena Ivanova, a Momentum activist, argues that Corbyn’s only option is to listen to party members who want a second referendum.  And: In the year since the mass-shooting in Parkland, Florida, the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, have been steadily working to build a political movement. Lois Beckett has been following them.

The talks are at a crucial stage. We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this house requires and deliver Brexit on time.”But Robbins, the most senior civil servant involved in the Brexit process, was overheard by a reporter from ITV, holding a late-night conversation in which he appeared to suggest she would wait until March – and then give MPs the choice between backing her, or accepting a long extension to article 50.According to the broadcaster, Robbins said the government had “got to make them believe that the week beginning end of March ... extension is possible, but if they don’t vote for the deal then the extension is a long one.”The tactic appears to be aimed squarely at members of the backbench Tory European Research Group (ERG), who may fear Brexit could ultimately be cancelled altogether, if MPs accept a delay.“The issue is whether Brussels is clear on the terms of extension,” Robbins was overheard saying. “In the end they will probably just give us an extension.”On the backstop, Robbins appeared to confirm that the government’s initial plan was for the backstop, which effectively keeps the UK in a customs union, to form a temporary “bridge” to the long-term trading relationship.“The big clash all along is the ‘safety net’,” Robbins said. “We agreed a bridge but it came out as a ‘safety net’.”Former Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) minister Steve Baker played down the leak, saying “as a consummate civil servant, Mr Robbins is likely to be appalled by this story. Officials advise. Ministers decide. What matters ultimately is the policy of the prime minister and the cabinet.”But another senior Brexiter said “the trouble with Mr Robbins is that he is a draughts player in a chess world”.Robbins’ revealing remarks are likely to embolden those ministers who are increasingly anxious about the threat of a no-deal Brexit.Several are privately signalling they are prepared to consider resigning in a fortnight’s time to ensure the success of cross-party efforts to force May’s hand, rather than allow her to continue gambling on a last-minute change of heart by Brexiter rebels.A government spokesman said “we don’t propose to comment on alleged remarks from a private conversation. The government’s focus is on securing the improvements parliament needs to pass a deal so we leave the EU on 29 March”.But Robbins’ overheard comments chimed with remarks from the leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, who refused to deny on Tuesday morning that the Commons could be denied a “meaningful vote”, until after the next scheduled European council meeting, which is due to be held on 21 March.“The prime minister is seeking to bring back the meaningful vote just as soon as possible,” Leadsom told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “So it is a negotiation. It’s not possible to predict the future.”However, if she seeks to delay until March, May is likely to face a fierce backlash from MPs, including some junior ministers, who believe every day of uncertainty increases the risks to jobs and businesses.One senior backbencher said there was “a palpable sense that the longer this drags on, the more the prime minister has to have a specific proposal that can win over the ERG, which seems unlikely, or cross-party support for a deal. If not, she’ll face mass resignations and another leadership crisis”.Another senior Conservative said: “It’s an utter tragedy that no-deal is still on the table. Cowards in the cabinet sit there updating Instagram, pretending everything is okay while we go through this bullshit parade. They’re lying to the British public and history will damn them forever.”Jeremy Corbyn accused May of playing for time and having no plan. “Our country is facing the biggest crisis in a generation, and yet this prime minister continues to recklessly run down the clock,” he said. But May, in turn, blamed Labour for increasing uncertainty by failing to support her deal.Robbins’ reported comments emerged after May cleared the way for a nerve-shredding, last-minute vote for her deal, by announcing that the government would seek to exclude the Brexit deal from the usual 21-day process under which parliament approves international treaties.MPs are due to vote on Thursday on a government motion, reaffirming their conditional acceptance of May’s deal, if she secures changes to the controversial backstop.When the Valentine’s Day vote was first mooted, it was regarded as a fresh opportunity for MPs to rule out no deal.But a cross-party group of MPs led by Labour’s Yvette Cooper, has opted not to table an amendment seeking to force the government to extend article 50, believing Conservative backbenchers are willing to give the prime minister another fortnight to continue negotiations in Brussels.Instead they published a revised bill, backed by senior Conservatives Caroline Spelman and Oliver Letwin, aimed at preventing no deal – and promised to table an amendment on 27 February, forcing the government to make time to pass it.“This bill creates a parliamentary safeguard to prevent us drifting into no deal by accident, and to prevent those crucial decisions being left until the final fortnight. The risks to jobs, the NHS and security from no deal are too great for us to stand back and let the government drift,” Cooper said.The new amendment is likely to be the vehicle for Conservative MPs keen to prevent the prime minister from running down the clock and increasing the risk of an “accidental” no-deal Brexit.Labour has tabled its own amendment to Thursday’s vote, putting in black and white her pledge to hold another amendable vote by 27 February, if she has not secured support for her deal by then."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee16fb9ac0f456a120660644006d86ed58207c8f/721_240_3234_1941/master/3234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63512d9ce79e7e370f2663b81510fa2f","title":"england mako vunipola six nations ankle injury rugby union","story":"Mako Vunipola has been ruled out of England’s final three Six Nations matches. The Saracens prop, who missed the autumn campaign because of injury, suffered ankle ligament damage against France on Sunday and will be out of action for an expected 10 weeks.Vunipola has been instrumental in England’s winning start to the tournament. He was the man of the match against Ireland in Dublin at the start of the month when he made 23 tackles.Ben Moon was on the bench against France on Sunday having displaced Ellis Genge, leaving Eddie Jones with a decision to make for the match against Wales in Cardiff next week.“It is very disappointing to lose Mako at this stage,” said the England coach, whose side are potentially a victory in Wales away from reclaiming the title from Ireland having secured a try bonus point in each of their two victories. Italy and Scotland at home follow. “He is an important player for us but it does provide an opportunity for the team to grow.”Saracens said in a statement: “Following medical assessments Mako Vunipola has been ruled out of England’s Six Nations campaign with an ankle ligament injury. Vunipola is expected to be out for 10 weeks. The prop will begin his rehabilitation with Saracens.”Vunipola was out for eight weeks with a calf strain sustained during Saracens’ European Champions Cup match at Glasgow in October. They face the same opponents in the quarter-finals at the end of next month.Wales will be without their No 8 Taulupe Faletau for the whole tournament. He suffered a broken arm playing for Bath last week in his return from the same injury and needs further surgery. Wales had hoped he would be available for at least their final match against Ireland but no date has been put on his comeback.“We’re gutted for Taulupe but this is the best course of action for him,” said the Bath director of rugby, Todd Blackadder. “We will know more in terms of a time frame following the surgery but we’re looking forward to welcoming him back into the squad.”Better news for Wales is the return of Leigh Halfpenny to full training three months after he was concussed during the victory over Australia.He will be available for selection against England but after so long out he is more likely to be a contender for the bench than a starting position.The Scarlets have a Pro14 match in Treviso on Saturday, for which Halfpenny may be released. “We will get a message about who, if anyone, is getting released after Wales train on Wednesday,” Pivac said.The Gloucester scrum-half Callum Braley has been called up by Italy for next week’s match against Ireland. The 24-year old qualifies through a grandfather."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a253d32ced21e4c57f3ac79dddb752bb24d41503/0_0_5592_3356/master/5592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c9742204fd0708772cf9ff0e9ca52b2","title":"uk sport no compromise funding olympics","story":"• Boost for sports which lost funding in previous Olympic cycle• Focus still on winning medals, says Katherine GraingerUK Sport is to soften its controversial “no compromise” approach to elite sport, which led to millions being funnelled into the best medal hopes while sports such as badminton and wheelchair rugby had their funding slashed, – after a public consultation.No compromise, which was introduced 20 years ago, brought huge success at Olympics and Paralympic Games but it also led to increasing questions about whether investing in fewer and fewer sports was the right way to inspire a nation. Under UK Sport’s new blueprint for elite sport, which will come into force after the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, more athletes will be funded across more sports.One major change is UK Sport will change its rules to allow it to fund sports with a realistic chance of making an Olympic podium in four to eight years – even if its current crop falls short. It will also set up a new “progression” funding stream to benefit up-and-coming sports and athletes.The UK Sport chair, Dame Katherine Grainger, insisted the organisation’s main focus would still be to win as many medals as possible. “People still believe in our principal objective of success in Olympic and Paralympic Games,” the London 2012 rowing gold medallist said. “What we heard quite loud and clear from the public is they have not had enough yet. They want more. Our aim is to pursue more medals by more medallists in more sports.”The UK Sport chief executive, Liz Nicholl, said it was still unclear how much funding the government would give for the Paris 2024 cycle but added: “We are confident government will continue to recognise the importance of elite sport and it will continue to support this world-leading system.” She also defended the medal-focused policy, saying: “No compromise was a term we used at the outset of allocating funding – it is about a no compromise focus on excellence and the right support being given the right athletes. It has never been about winning at all costs. It has been about excellence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2650d210d579f14f76061f8ed997d573842c2032/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a27016676b468bf222bd3fa1e283418e","title":"all about eve review classic hollywood updated with technical wizardry","story":"Gillian Anderson and Lily James give fine performances but this version of the 1950 film might be a little too clever for its own goodThis is a show that reeks of chic. It stars Gillian Anderson and Lily James. It is adapted and directed by the Belgian wizard Ivo van Hove from a classic 1950 movie by Joseph Mankiewicz. It mixes live action and film with technical finesse. Yet, for all its skill, I found myself admiring its cleverness more than relishing its drama.When van Hove and his designer, Jan Versweyveld, applied similar techniques to Network at the National they improved on the movie by highlighting the transformation of TV news into a branch of show-business. Here I’m not sure what the staging adds to the story of the eclipse of a legendary Broadway star, Margo Channing, by her dedicated disciple, Eve Harrington.The movie manages to be both a satire on, and a love letter to, the hermetic absurdities of the theatre industry. Some of the zing and zip has gone out of the stage version, which treats Margo as a tragic figure. At one point Anderson sits in front of a mirror while tricksy camerawork shows her fine features rapidly ageing: at another, the camera eavesdrops on her spewing into a toilet-bowl while her party-guests make merry. This feels more like an Ingmar Bergman movie than a Mankiewicz satire.The use of technology is admittedly sophisticated. At a celebrated Stork Club dinner party a ferocious encounter in the ladies’ room between Eve and Karen, wife of a famous playwright, is projected on to a screen as it happens: at the same time we see the subjects of their debate swilling champagne downstage. But there is a palpable irony to the fact that we are always conscious of watching a piece of director’s theatre. This is very much Van Hove’s show, whereas All About Eve depicts a vanished theatrical world where sacred monsters like Margo Channing ruled the roost and the writer and director were seen as totally subservient.This is not to deny that the actors do a good job. Even if it is hard to accept Anderson as a fading beauty, she invests Margo with a slow drawl and a pensive awareness of her own dispensability: she’s less of a testy termagant than Bette Davis but more vulnerable in the style of Tennessee Williams’s Blanche Dubois. Lily James also captures Eve’s mix of faux-naivety and sly cunning and her features positively glow when the camera goes up close.The most striking performances, however, come in the subsidiary roles. Monica Dolan is outstanding as Karen, the watchful civilian in a world of embattled theatrical pros, and Stanley Townsend is superb as the power-crazed critic, Addison DeWitt, who dispenses his bon mots with the steel-tipped venom of a would-be performer. Sheila Reid as a witty dresser, Julian Ovenden as a fraught director and Rhashan Stone as a gullible playwright lend good support but, in the end, the show remains a clever, mixed-media hybrid that never achieves the emotional pull of first-rate drama."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea4afb1b9124a8daaab8ef84cbe50b6cda2a262b/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4136b1d82743b2caf4bd722e082a8203","title":"everything you ever wanted to know about veganism","story":"Thinking of going vegan, but not sure whether it will suit your lifestyle? Basil Kronfli, who has been vegan for two years, gives us the lowdown on the pros, cons and quirks of an animal-free diet …Do you actually like the taste of vegan food?Absolutely. I love foods such as peanut butter, dark chocolate, hummus, falafel, roast potatoes, berries and mangos – which are all vegan. It’s actually much easier to eat vegan than I thought it would be when I made the switch two years ago.Are there any grey areas with some vegan foods?Honey is as tricky as it is sticky, and really ides the vegan community. On the one hand, it’s an animal product and vegans don’t eat animal products. On the other, beekeepers are actually helping bee populations – which have been dwindling in recent years – so supporting them by eating honey could be seen as a good deed for the bees. What makes things even more complicated is the fact that when beekeepers harvest the honey, they replace it with a sugar syrup that lacks the essential micronutrients of honey and isn’t as healthy for bees. Basically, it’s complicated.Do you feel like you miss out on sweet treats such as chocolate and ice-cream?It’s such a misconception that being vegan means you can’t have indulgent foods. Bourbon biscuits, golden syrup, boiled sweets, sorbets and dark chocolate are all vegan (to name but a few), and more and more sweet vegan treats are entering the market.For instance, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s now has vegan versions of three of its most popular ice-creams: Chocolate Fudge Brownie, Chunky Monkey and Peanut Butter \u0026amp Cookies. It’s also just released a new vegan flavour: Coconutterly Caramel’d.What’s the most challenging thing about being vegan?I love baking, and not being able to use eggs can be pretty tricky. Baking vegan treats is getting easier, but when you’ve baked with eggs your whole life, getting used to replacements can be challenging, especially as there’s no one-size-fits-all solution.Where do you get your protein?Plenty of wholefoods pack a healthy dose of protein. Soy, pulses and nuts are just a few examples you can easily get in your daily diet. Going for Japanese food? Get a bowl of edamame and you’ll hit your daily requirement in no time. Increasingly, vegan protein supplements are really easy to access, too – brown rice protein is one of the most popular vegan proteins and is a great alternative for those avoiding soy.Are there any health downsides?There are a couple of vitamins and minerals you will probably want to supplement if you make the switch. The most talked about is vitamin B12. The reason this is lacking from most vegan diets comes down to the quality of soil in vegetables we eat today compared with pre-commercial farming soil. Other optional supplements can come from food. Mushrooms, for example, pack plenty of vitamin D. Flax seeds have the essential fatty acids vegans won’t be getting from fish, broccoli has biotin, while tomatoes have lycopene.What’s eating out as a vegan like?There’s plenty of choice in the UK. Loads of popular chain restaurants now have vegan menus or, at the very least, a couple of vegan options. When you go farther afield, especially on the continent, the meat and cheese can get a bit relentless, but there’s an excellent app that can help with that. It’s called HappyCow and it matches you with suitable eateries nearby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e5a1c12521a64d3cea857c1fac9bf31f03c908/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=700\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=max\u0026s=11d5f2a567295cadb85321cfe3f9b4cb","title":"from ice cream to nice cream the inside scoop on the ice cream revolutionaries","story":" In 1978, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield set out to make ice-cream with a difference. Here’s how Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is still pushing boundaries and fighting for change 40 years laterWhen Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield first set up shop in an old petrol station in Burlington, Vermont, in 1978, selling scoops of homemade ice-cream, they wanted to build a company that cared as much about people as profits.Since then, their tiny ice-cream business has become a global brand whose famous flavours, including Cookie Dough and Cherry Garcia, are sold in 35 countries. Yet, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s ethos remains the same: to “make great ice-cream in the nicest possible way”.It’s a belief that is central to everything the brand does, from its social activism to constant experimentation with new flavours. The ethos inspired Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s line of non-dairy ice-creams that was launched in the UK in 2017 to a rapturous reception from vegans. The flavours – Chunky Monkey, Chocolate Fudge Brownie and Peanut Butter \u0026amp Cookies and the new flavour Coconutterly Caramel’d – are just as inventively delicious as the brand’s dairy creations.For Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s employees, honouring the goals of its co-founders – who remain advisers to the company since being bought by Unilever in the year 2000 – is vital. “Right from the start, Cohen and Greenfield wanted the business to be a force for good,” says Rebecca Baron, the brand’s social mission manager. “Four decades on, we’re still guided by their values.”Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s three-pronged approach – making excellent ice-cream achieving financial success and using the brand to make the world a better place – stems back to ideas developed by Cohen and Greenfield in the company’s early days.The company works with social enterprises, such as Greyston Bakery in New York, which supplies the brownies that make the Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavour so enticing. “They employ people with criminal records, homeless people, recovering addicts and vulnerable women – people who are finding it hard to get a job,” says Baron. “They offer subsidised housing and healthcare to their workers.”Once Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s popularity began to grow, it quickly realised that it could use its platform to campaign on social issues. It was a discovery born of a David and Goliath tussle with its rival, Häagen-Dazs.“Greenfield had the idea to pack the ice-cream into pint-sized containers and sell it in convenience stores, but Pillsbury, who owned Häagen-Dazs, didn’t like this at all,” says Baron. “They threatened all their stores with exclusivity clauses, saying they could stock one, but not both. Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s didn’t have the resources to fight it in the courts, so Greenfield created a one-man picket outside the Pillsbury headquarters. Pictures of him were everywhere. They managed to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people to put pressure on Pillsbury to back down, which they eventually did.”The same principle is applied to its latest campaigns on issues including climate change, marriage equality, racism and refugees. The brand is currently running a company-wide campaign, lobbying the UK government to allow asylum seekers the right to work. “At the moment, they’re banned, which means people can be living in poverty for years,” says Baron. “We’re using every tool we have as a business to mobilise our fans to help us create systemic change.”One area the brand is pouring a lot of effort into is reducing its carbon footprint. Its caring dairy programme has more than 300 participating farms in the US and Europe. “The idea is that the farms that Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s offers support to have to meet high environmental standards,” says Baron. “The company is always working to move into increasingly sustainable farming practices and improve its emissions.”The launch of its almond milk-based non-dairy range – with more flavours set to arrive in Britain in 2019 – is a way to offer a lower-emission alternative to the increasing numbers of people who aren’t necessarily vegan, but want to make more ethical food choices. “So many people want to reduce their personal carbon footprint, so it’s great to give people that flexibility,” she says.And for those who are vegan, or lactose intolerant, the range aims to prove that it needn’t mean missing out. One of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s key principles is inclusion, which its non-dairy range fits into perfectly. “We wanted to offer people who can’t – or have chosen not to – eat dairy ice-cream, an alternative that is just as good as the dairy version,” she says. “We wanted to make sure they get some love, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bc71bface7ef6903bde9854f48c8988b922630/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f948dcdbaf8026e4e43892e7df17b71a","title":"theres never been a better time to be vegan","story":"With restaurants, chefs and well-known brands introducing more vegan options than ever, sticking to a plant-based diet is now both simple and indulgent, says Club Mexicana’s Meriel Armitage A decade ago, when I decided to go vegan for ethical reasons, the word “decadent” was one you’d never have used to describe the food available. More often than not, it fitted the joyless stereotype of lentils, quinoa and tofu, with the occasional Linda McCartney vegan sausage to liven things up. Now, though, ask a vegan what they ate last night and they’re likely to say anything from pizza topped with gooey melted “cheese” to crispy fried “chicken” or pulled jackfruit burritos. The vegan scene has truly exploded, introducing food that’s exciting, colourful and indulgent, whether you’re vegan or not.When I launched my pop-up, Club Mexicana, in 2012 I wanted to challenge the boringly virtuous chickpea and chia seed perception of veganism. Inspired by my travels in the US, where vegan food is innovative and delicious, I wanted to prove that being vegan doesn’t mean missing out.I realised the joy of Mexican food doesn’t stem from the meat, but the bold, punchy flavours created by salsas and pickles – the meat is just a carrier for those flavours. We try to be as creative as possible with our dishes, which include tacos with baja “tofish” – tofu fish – and roasted cornbread with pecan mole, smoked soya yoghurt, pickled pear and smoked tomato. When we first started holding supper clubs, a lot of people didn’t even notice the food was vegan, which is what I wanted.Over the past few years, vegan ingredients have evolved rapidly, which has helped vegan cooking to become as exciting as it is. Vegan cheese used to be terrible, but now you can buy everything from vegan blue cheese and camembert to cheddar and ricotta – all tasting as piquant and decadently creamy as the real thing. At Club Mexicana, we serve deep-fried “mozzarella” sticks made with coconut oil, which are crispy on the outside and oozingly melty in the middle.People also often wrongly assume that going vegan will mean depriving themselves of indulgent desserts and treats, but that’s no longer the case either. The naughtiest dish we offer is deep-fried ice-cream doused in chocolate sauce – it really doesn’t get more indulgent than that.More and more restaurants are offering innovative vegan menus. Supermarkets now stock an amazing range of vegan food that’s expanding all the time. Brands, such as Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s, are constantly bringing out new vegan products that are causing a buzz outside, as well as inside, the vegan world.There’s never been a better time to be vegan, or just to introduce more plant-based alternatives into your everyday diet. With so many amazing colours, textures and flavours on offer, you never need to feel you’re depriving yourself of the food you love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d91b242773da8bb8b59b6172add16b02a950b71/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e39d98650f31bb823423fe3601fccc87","title":"send us a tip on small music venues the world over for the chance of winning a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Whether it’s a shack, ornate theatre or backstreet club, we want to know about your favourite small music venue – anywhere apart from the UKHearing great live music in an authentic and memorable setting can be a highlight of any trip.Venues including shebeens, clubs, theatres, basements, e bars and even churches can all prove brilliant settings for gigs.We want to hear about great venues anywhere in the world, but not festivals or the UK this time (we covered that in December) – and definitely not arenas or stadium gigs.

Here are her best movesWhen it comes to Twitter, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress last November, beats every other US politician hands, nose and elbows down. She has built one of the most engaged followings on Capitol Hill in just eight months and was even appointed to teach social media lessons to her colleagues upon her arrival.How does she do it? I spend my days analyzing data for the  and helping run our social media accounts, so I’m used to digging into numbers and figuring out what gets people going. And more often than not, it’s the less obvious things that reveal what’s really happening.Ocasio-Cortez also has more than 2.1 million followers on Instagram and 500,000 on Facebook, but Twitter is where she really dominates the conversation.She already has more Twitter followers than the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi (2.2 million), and she only just trails Joe Biden (3.3 million). Even when you look at pure, non-weighted engagement, Ocasio-Cortez still punches well above her weight. For example, Trump has 21 times more followers than her. Yet he generated only 2.5 times as many total interactions as she did in January (43.2m compared to 17.5m).All these numbers are useful for understanding the scale of Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter popularity, but do little in terms of explaining it. To further understand why they’ve done so well, here’s a brief timeline of her rapid ascent, and the tweets that have defined it:Ocasio-Cortez introduced herself to many voters with a campaign video in May that ended up going semi-viral. But it was her primary win in June that first gave her a national platform, and this tweet (her biggest in June) set the tone for how she was going to operate.It quickly established that Ocasio-Cortez wasn’t going to let her critics – whether Republicans or Democrats – shape her narrative. Her tweet is a two-part fact-check. But instead of using cold stats like fact-checks usually do, she provides photographic and anecdotal evidence that’s much more personal and emotive.Whether they like it or not, the very fair and balanced people over at Fox News have played a considerable role in Ocasio-Cortez’s success. On top of the all the free airtime they’ve given her, they’ve also provided her with plenty of ammo.The above graphic in particular sparked a running joke that Ocasio-Cortez would use again: is the Fox News graphics department actually on her side?During a recent talk, the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates asked Ocasio-Cortez when she decides to “dunk on fools”. “Whoever is coming at me in my mentions with a blue check when I haven’t eaten in three hours,” she said. “And until more people start pitching in and holding people to account, I’m just going to let them have it.”This was Ocasio-Cortez’s most popular tweet in September and, just like her biggest one in June, she’s setting the record straight.Targeting the far right is always going to be a popular move on Twitter. But it’s her use of “slaying lewks” that douses her already fire tweet with the most flammable thing on the internet: relatability. She speaks the language of her young fans, and they’ve probably never seen anything like it from a politician before.This is what really sets her apart in Congress. Most politicians are elected to represent normal people yet have to hire consultants for advice on how to speak to millennials. Remember when Hillary Clinton told people to “Pokémon Go to the polls”?It should also be noted that September was the month Ocasio-Cortez took her Fox-trolling to new heights:It’s no surprise that, in an age where authenticity matters more than ever, Ocasio-Cortez has done so well. Her story of growing up in a working-class family and bartending a year before she won her primary has become a powerful part of her appeal.It’s not the sole reason she’s popular, but rather acts as a shield around her beliefs. Republicans have tried to dismantle this story as much as possible, and you can see why. After they’ve spent decades trying to paint liberals as out-of-touch elites, it’s one of the biggest threats to their entire narrative.It may not sound like much to anyone who regularly uses emojis, but this is big for a member of Congress. Remember when Hillary asked people to sum up how people felt about student debt in three emojis? And can you imagine someone like Beto O’Rourke or Elizabeth Warren even using the cry-laughing one without it looking weird? (Case in point: Warren attempted to speak internet last month, by asking the account WeRateDogs if her golden retriever was a “1510 official Good Boy”.)There’s no magic to Ocasio-Cortez’s use of our modern-day hieroglyphs, but what’s notable is how you rarely notice them – they never jar or stand out. Like the rest of her language they have a natural flow, and help crystallize her air of authenticity.This tweet was Ocasio-Cortez’s biggest in December. In it, she contrasts her working-class background with her new job in Congress, and taps into people’s huge frustrations with the healthcare system.Intentionally or not, it proves she’s still one of us, and isn’t going to give Congress a free pass now she’s part of it. There’s not much to dislike if you’re a young, leftwing American who values authenticity and a willingness to hold power to account.January was @AOC’s biggest month so far, with the account adding a million new followers. A great deal of this momentum was generated by this one tweet, which got over 160k retweets and 787,000 likes.The video shows her dancing to Edwin Starr’s song War (the one that goes “what is it good for?”). It was a tongue-in-cheek response after she was “outed” for dancing in a spoof music video in college.The original footage was posted by a strange, seemingly rightwing account looking to undermine her. “Here is America’s favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is,” read the post. The account was later deleted, raising the hilarious possibility that it was planted by someone on the left who knew it would do wonders for her.Either way, it became the new focal point for the left’s battle with the right over Ocasio-Cortez, and a huge news story.The idea that all Republicans were mocking her for dancing quickly took hold, despite limited examples of them doing so. But the smear did chime with many of the right’s pearl-clutching attacks on her, and the leftwing backlash became part of a wider cry of frustration over her treatment by Republicans.Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet was the climax of the whole ordeal and even by her standards was a surprise. Politicians have danced before Obama was particularly adept at it. But has anyone ever done it in a way that is both entertaining and makes a deft political point?The tweet is really a perfect example of why Ocasio-Cortez has done so well on Twitter. She doesn’t just respond to news or release statements like most politicians – she creates her own content and makes her own news, in an unpredictable and authentic way.And just when you think you’ve seen all the possible fact-checks, clapbacks, and details from her past, she comes out dancing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c29271266708350c0a5c909149b2b2a0b3a5f0ec/0_159_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83703a4540901092f31a4751c9975dae","title":"home office criticised for accelerating removals to zimbabwe","story":"Lawyers say UK is working with Zimbabwe to deport asylum seekers despite human rights abusesThe Zimbabweans facing deportation from the UK The Home Office has been condemned for working with the Zimbabwean government to accelerate the deportation of asylum seekers despite high-profile human rights abuses in the country.Asylum lawyers and charities told the  that since Robert Mugabe was forced from power in November 2017, the Home Office has started to push ahead with a removals process for refused asylum seekers, many of whom have been in the UK for over a decade.Despite international condemnation of the actions of the police and army under the new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, two asylum seekers were detained at the Home Office’s Vulcan House building on Monday. It is thought that the government is preparing to deport them within days.One of them, Victor Mujakachi, came to the UK as a postgraduate student in 2003. Zimbabwean authorities issued a warrant for his arrest in 2008 after he made critical comments online about the re-election of Mugabe. He subsequently had three applications for asylum turned down.On 28 January at 4pm, the courts also had to grant an “urgent stay of removal” for a Zimbabwean refused asylum who was due to be deported at 5.25pm that evening. The reason given for the decision was the volatile conditions in the country.The applicant claimed to have a profile as an opposition activist and said their family members had been arrested. The judge noted that serious concerns had been expressed by governments around the world, including the UK, about conditions in Zimbabwe.Over the last few months, Zimbabweans across the UK have been asked to attend interviews at Home Office centres. When they attended they found Zimbabwean government officials waiting to interview them.One woman, who has been in the UK six years, said she attended one such interview and was told by a man speaking her native language, Shona, that she was one of thousands of Zimbabweans that the UK government wanted to remove from the country.The woman told the  that the official had a file on her, which contained her photograph and biographical details. Her relatives are politicians with the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), and one was recently arrested. “I am so anxious and I am so petrified,” she said. “If the Home Office now is sharing my details with the Zimbabweans, then they are selling my life to them.”The Home Office said “routine re-documentation interviews” often take place to establish the identity of an inidual so that travel documentation can be issued. A spokesperson said: “Where a decision has been made that a person does not require international protection removal is only enforced when we and the courts conclude that it is safe to do so, with a safe route of return.”After Mugabe was ousted, his former close aide Emmerson Mnangagwa from the same Zanu-PF party came to power. Despite hopes that his government would bring political reform, human rights activists have condemned arbitrary arrests, abductions and beatings committed by the police and military.Under Mugabe, the Zimbabwean authorities had refused to cooperate with attempts by the UK to return refused asylum seekers, declining to issue travel documents to those being asked to return to Zimbabwe against their will. This left thousands of people in legal limbo, with no legal status in the UK, so unable to work, but also unable to be returned to Zimbabwe.But Zimbabwean media reported in February 2018 that, following a meeting with the then British ambassador to Zimbabwe, Catriona Laing, the country’s new vice-president, Kembo Mohadi, said: “Zimbabwe has no problems receiving its nationals back, but would want them vetted to ensure they are genuine Zimbabweans before taking them back.”The asylum seeker charity, Assist Sheffield, said it was extremely worried about Victor Mujakachi’s safety if he were to be forcibly returned to Zimbabwe. It said he was an invaluable volunteer in many charities in the area, including its emergency night shelter, and had won awards for his charity work.“Victor is an outspoken critic of successive Zimbabwean governments and has expressed worries for his safety, should he be returned, especially given the recent brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters in the country,” the organisation said in a statement.In a recent petition to the Home Office, UK-based members of the the MDC, called on the government to give amnesty to all Zimbabweans who had been in the UK more than 10 years.“Most Zimbabweans in the UK are now settled, and they now have private and family life in the UK,” the petition said. “The issue of the Windrush generation shows that the Home Office has sometimes got it wrong, but the secretary of state has got the power to take corrective action.”Alice Muzira, a lawyer at Thompson and Co Solicitors, said the UK government should urgently review its position while there were still human rights violations in Zimbabwe. “Removals should be suspended and the situation in relation to safety of returns to Zimbabwe closely monitored,” she said.Andrew Nyamayaro, principal solicitor at Tann Law Solicitors, said: “Civilians are being tortured by members of the armed forces and the ruling party. Enforcing removals of Zimbabweans from the UK at this juncture is tantamount to sending someone to a death chamber.”Diane Abbott, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said: “The government’s resumption of deportations to Zimbabwe is in line with their hostile environment policy. The Home Office appear to have little regard for potential human rights abuses and are deporting people who may be at risk. This should not be happening in any case where serious human rights are under threat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73636f12797de8639f20dda84e1e99088fc3dcb9/0_174_5207_3124/master/5207.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8248caa00dca067821bd8db086b62743","title":"danish waste to energy projects key selling point ski slope","story":"Idea of topping municipal plant in Copenhagen with urban ski resort won accolades for Danish architecture firmIt might be the first waste incinerator the neighbours actually want next door. The shop at the foot of the Amager Bakke waste-to-energy project in Copenhagen is packed with families desperate to be among the first to try its unique selling point: the ski slope on the roof.Ten minutes and three magic carpet lifts later, we are standing next to three short fir trees at the top of a blue run, an artificial slope consisting of green and turquoise bristles. Through the smoke from the next door Amagerværket power plant, Sweden is visible across the straits and to the other side a wide  of central Copenhagen.The idea of topping a municipal plant with an urban ski resort won a string of accolades for the Danish architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) before the first shovel was even lifted. Time Magazine judged it one of the most innovative 50 ideas of 2011. Two years ago the architectural model went on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.The building is wrapped in a facade of aluminium planters which will later drip with greenery. In the original plan, the chimney was to blow smoke rings, one for every tonne of CO2 generated.But turning BIG’s inspired architectural sketches into reality has been challenging, says Patrick Gustafsson, the project manager who was hired “to prove it is actually a sound idea and not just a fantastic idea”. “No one has ever done this before, and that’s maybe for a reason, I sometimes think,” he laughs.Above the carpet lifts, workers in fluorescent orange jackets are still finishing the landscaping on the steeper black and red runs and on the button lift that will serve them.The ski resort alone has ended up costing 92m Danish kroner (£8m). The first day of skiing is more than a year late and it is only a two-day preview, with the slope now scheduled to be finished by May.The smoke ring mechanism has been put on hold, in part because Peter Madsen, the artist who helped design it, was sentenced to life in prison for murder.Christian Engels, the chief executive of Copenhill, as the ski facility is called, says he aims to provide a condensed version of a holiday in the Alps: “The full package, skiing, apres ski, everything, boiled down into a three- or four-hour experience.”People living in the enormous apartment complex 150 metres away were given advance notice of the two-day opening, so they had a chance to snap up the half-price tickets. But others have come from further afield. Behind me on the magic carpet lift is Ricardo Karam, a Brazilian who lectures at the University of Copenhagen.“You need to get used to it,” he says of the dry slope. “But after a couple of runs, it’s really fun and I can imagine that once the whole thing is finished, it will be even better.”A keen snowboarder, Karam has been looking forward to the centre opening since he arrived in the city five years ago. “The idea, it’s fantastic. I’ve been looking at this building and just waiting for years.”Once I round the slope’s first and only corner, I accelerate towards a small ridge, only to discover that it is covered in black silicon paste that stops my skis dead and catapults me hands first on to the lacerating bristles.“It’s like glue,” says Karam as he helps me up. “It’s supposed to help you slide better. When I saw you I thought: oh no, it’s already too late.”At the bottom, Fredslund and his sons seem excited but also slightly disappointed. “It’s fun, a little bit short of course,” he says. “But we are already improving after just three runs.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55a71c9904a2b98c1eee024aebc1d2dc564ffa81/0_31_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f09d929193abb4c7f95d0100214878ad","title":"digital political parties democratic m5s","story":"Digital parties may help solve a crisis of legitimacy in politics, but are they truly democratic?It was the biggest decision in the party’s young life, a turning point that will define its reputation for years to come.The process was perhaps the most striking example of an emerging trend at the heart of 21st-century politics – the use of digital technology to bring people into the hearts of movements from Italy and Spain to France, Scandinavia to the UK.The digital world has taken a great deal of criticism for subverting open societies, but could it also be a motor for a democratic revival? Could these digital innovations – mostly confined to new, populist parties – help revitalise our liberal democracies?The pioneers of digital democracies were the pirate parties of northern Europe who first broke through in Sweden, Germany and Iceland about a decade ago, using an online decision-making platform called LiquidFeedback. One of its founders, Andreas Nitsche, said the idea was that “empowering the ordinary members would make these parties more responsive to the demands of society”.More recently, the fiercely anti-establishment M5S and the Spanish leftwing populist party Podemos have led the way. “Ordinary citizens will become protagonists, abandoning the current system of delegate democracy in the hands of politicians,” said the late Gianroberto Casaleggio, who masterminded the M5S digital strategy. Given the discredited status of Italy’s political class, this narrative appealed to many citizens.M5S made digital democracy its core creed, with its anthem proclaiming: “We are not a party, we are not a caste, one man, one vote, one man, one vote.” A variety of new parties have followed suit, to the point where digital democracy has now become a must for all new political movements that want to be seen as in sync with the times.The central innovation is the “participatory platform”. This is an online portal, often part of the official party website, that hosts a number of interactive features. These might include donations, training sessions, discussions on policy and online ballots for primaries, elections of party officers, or strategic decisions, for instance whether to enter an alliance or the position to take on a specific policy.The M5S platform is named Rousseau, after the Genevan political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Casaleggio liked to describe it as the “collective intelligence of the movement”.Podemos has a participation portal named Participa (“participate”). It comprises a voting area and a discussion system named Plaza Podemos (Podemos Square) that is similar to Reddit, with threaded discussions and upvotedownvote functionalities, which earned it the moniker of “Reddit party”.These sites closely mimic the logic of social media platforms, with discussions, votes, likes and other metrics to assess users’ views. For Miguel Ardanuy, a former participation coordinator of Podemos, the ultimate aim of this “platformisation of the party” is to “construct a different model of party, a party more open and responsive to society, where you do not need a membership card in order to participate”.News doesn\u0027t always have to be miserable – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“We live in an era of disintermediation, where we are bypassing the old middlemen, such as travel agencies,” said Roberto Fico, a M5S politician and the current president of the Italian parliament’s lower chamber, the Chamber of Deputies. “Digital democracy embodies the same tendency applied to politics, allowing people to have a say directly on important decisions without depending on their representatives.”The strategy has proven highly successful, enabling parties short of economic resources to achieve huge reach and scale. M5S is in government in Italy. Podemos rapidly surged to become Spain’s third largest political force, and underpins the present administration. There are few historical precedents of new political parties achieving comparable results in such a short time.This electoral prowess largely derives from an ability to recruit a large base of members. Podemos and the leftist French group La France Insoumise (France Defiant) boasted more than 500,000 members each at the start of 2019, putting them in Europe’s political major league. (M5S has fewer – about 150,000 some blame a cumbersome registration process for this.)Opting for a free membership system, similar to the free sign-up model of digital companies such as Facebook, Google or Twitter, has radically lowered the barrier to entry compared with traditional parties. “We built an open and flexible structure eliding the traditional separation between members and sympathisers,” said Guillaume Royer, who led the development of La France Insoumise’s own platform.The platforms enable parties to solicit ideas from members which can be evaluated by experts before being submitted to a wider online vote. M5S, Podemos and La France Insoumise have all crowdsourced ideas this way for their election manifestos.Yet in practice, most of the online voting tends to relate to the election of officials, or yesno internal referendums. E-ballots have often been used more as a means of propaganda, to demonstrate the cohesion of party members, rather than as an opportunity for a genuine and pluralist internal debate.Out of more than 40 referendums carried out by M5S, there have been just two instances in which members have gone against the leadership’s will. Of the dozen online referendums held by Podemos since 2014, there has been not a single case of rank-and-file rebellion.According to M5S activist Davide Bono, this tendency towards unanimity stems from the fact that “activists share a strong collective identity and agree on many common points”. However, landslide results also hint at the strong control exercised by the party leadership over internal decision-making.There are a number of ways in which the leadership can influence internal consultations. The staff responsible for the management of digital platforms are often directly dependent on the party leadership, and therefore liable to pressure.Furthermore, apparently trivial things, such as the formulation of questions, the timing of votes or even the order of options on the ballot, can steer voters towards the preferred option.Finally, the leadership can create a mood conducive to its own will. David Puente, a former employee of Casaleggio, recounts how, in anticipation of important decisions, the employees and the all-important blog of party co-founder Beppe Grillo would adopt a certain line with the aim of influencing the decision. “It was enough for Grillo to say A, and the members would vote A.”Far from being the protagonists, party members are more akin to non-player characters, or NPCs, to use a term often used in digital subcultures. They are agents who can only respond to the stimuli coming from above, with little room for proactive intervention.“It’s a wasted opportunity,” said Yago Bermejo Abati, the project coordinator of Media Lab Prado in Madrid, who was originally involved in designing Podemos’s participation portal. “Given all the initial hope, this is a great disappointment.” Party members themselves seem to have become wary of digital democracy’s limits, as seen in the falling number of participants in the online consultations of Podemos and M5S.These failings may merely be teething problems of a new tendency that seems here to stay. A number of mainstream political parties have already integrated digital democracy functions. In the UK, the Labour party allowed members to vote online in the 2016 leadership election, and the leftwing, pro-Jeremy Corbyn campaign group Momentum has created its own participatory platform called MyMomentum.In Spain, the ruling socialist party, PSOE, used online voting in 2016, allowing members to express their opinion on a coalition government proposal. Local mayoralties in cities such as Barcelona, Madrid and Reykjavik are carrying out online consultations and, since entering government, M5S has created a “ministry of direct democracy”.We may be only just starting to understand how digital democracy can help address the crisis of legitimacy that is affecting different levels of the political process.Follow the ’s series on the rise of populism at www.gunew-populism• Paolo Gerbaudo is a political sociologist and the director of the Centre for Digital Culture at King’s College London "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e88d858e79da1411e4e4c349a7b6b354b88b5588/0_117_1939_1164/master/1939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a861e497f7a0d0d60018a19c0f24025f","title":"first photograph of rare african black leopard captured in more than a century","story":"Images were taken by British wildlife photographer, Will Burrard-Lucas, in Laikipia Wilderness Camp in KenyaThe wild African black leopard has been the stuff of legend and campfire story for decades.The animal – whose coat is sooty black as a result of melanism, the opposite of albinism – is extremely rare.But a British wildlife photographer has become the first person to photograph the black leopard in more than a century.Will Burrard-Lucas captured the images, which were released to the public on Monday, at the Laikipia Wilderness Camp in Kenya after hearing reports of sightings in the area.After meeting with locals who had seen the animals, and following leopard tracks, Burrard-Lucas set up a Camtraptions camera trap that included wireless motion sensors, in the hope of photographing the animals at night.After several days without success Burrard-Lucas returned to his cameras to find a striking image.“I had a quick look at the last trap, not expecting to find much,” Burrard-Lucas wrote on his blog. “As I scrolled through the images on the back of the camera, I paused and peered at the photograph below in incomprehension … a pair of eyes surrounded by inky darkness … a black leopard!

The next general election is due to be held next year.The prime minister had been banking on the fact that the prospect of an early election – and a possible win for rightwing parties that fiercely oppose Catalan secession – would make the two big Catalan pro-independence parties swing behind the budget.But, speaking to the  and other European media, the Catalan leader, Quim Torra, said the secessionist groupings would not be forced into supporting Sánchez’s budget plans.“Are we meant to approve the budget because we’re afraid of the Spanish right?” said Torra. “Mr Sánchez can obviously decide to call elections whenever he wants – he’s the prime minister. But why would he make dialogue conditional on approving the budget?“Look, between the far right and a PSOE that won’t accept our right to self-determination, I choose Catalan independence.”Efforts to find a political solution to the independence crisis have been hampered by pressure from rightwing parties – and by the start of the trial in Madrid on Tuesday of 12 Catalan separatist leaders.On Sunday, tens of thousands of people joined a rally in central Madrid to express their vent their fury at what they see as the overly conciliatory stance adopted by the Sánchez, and to demand a snap general election.The demonstration was called by the People’s party and the centre-right Citizens party, and backed by the far-right Vox party. It also attracted some supporters of fascist and extreme-right groups.On Tuesday morning, Sánchez warned that the Spanish right and Catalan independence leaders risked derailing important social measures in the budget.“Both want the same thing,” he tweeted. “A Catalonia at odds with itself and a Spain at odds with itself. We’re working for a harmonious Catalonia and a united Spain.”Spain’s treasury minister said the government would not cede “to any blackmail by anybody” when it came to the budget.“Under no circumstance will we admit that the right to self-determination in Catalonia appears in any talking points,” María Jesús Montero said as Tuesday morning’s budget debate began."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8938b7b28c7d13f713518d329d754a5d646f5732/0_64_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fd7f137023ea4b2f50ab6eb27a841da","title":"thailand election princess apologises as future of thai raksa party in doubt","story":"King’s sister says she is sorry for causing ‘problems’ as authorities recommend dissolution of her partyThe political turbulence in Thailand has continued to escalate in the build-up to the election, with a political party likely to be forcibly dissolved, the military suspending a critical TV station and the king’s sister apologising after she was disqualified from running for prime minister.The latest incident in a week that has stunned Thailand, saw the election commission recommend the Thai Raksa Chart party be dissolved by the constitutional court, preventing it from running in the election, for violating the rules of a constitutional monarchy. The constitutional court is expected to approve the election commission’s request.It came just hours after Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi released a statement on Instagram on Tuesday night, apologising for causing “problems” for the Thai people.On Monday, the election commission had already ruled to disqualify Ubolratana as a prime minister candidate for the Thai Raksa Chart party in the upcoming election on 24 March. Ubolratana’s ban did not come as a surprise after the strong condemnation of her candidacy by her brother King Maha Vajiralongkorn last week, who decreed that her bid was “inappropriate” as royalty should be “above politics”.“I’m sorry that the sincere intention to work to help the country and our Thai people had caused problems that had seemed unlikely to occur in this day and age,” Ubolratana wrote on Instagram, followed by the hashtag #howcomeitsthewayitis.The recommendation for the dissolution of Thai Raksa Chart, a newly-formed party closely aligned with ousted ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, came as a huge blow to the party, who, in a fight for their political life, wrote to the election commission on Wednesday morning, stating that the forced dissolution of the party would contravene Thai law. However, their pleas fell of deaf ears.If the constitutional court agrees to dissolve Thai Raksa Chart, its executives could be given a 10 year or even a lifetime ban from both voting and running in elections.The dissolution of Thai Raksa is a further indicator that Thaksin’s gamble in nominating the princess as their only prime ministerial candidate, without apparent full approval of the king, was a gamble that did not pay off and will likely hurt the chances of pro-Thaksin parties gaining a majority in the March election. Thaksin lives in exile but still hold considerable power and influence in Thai politics.Several prominent members of Pheu Thai, the party Thaksin founded, switched over to Thai Raksa when it was formed last year.Thai Raksa has pitched itself to appeal to younger, progressive voters. In several constituencies, Pheu Thai did not put up candidates in order to make way for Thai Raksa candidates, to increase their chances of a majority in parliament. However, it now means that many constituencies are now without a pro-Thaksin party candidate.The saga has played into the hands of the military junta government, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), who are seeking to maintain their power through the newly-formed pro-military party, Palang Pracharath. NCPO leader Prayut Chan-Ocha is running as their candidate for prime minister.In a move possibly emboldened by the turmoil and uncertainty enveloping pro-Thaksin parties, the junta also announced a 15 day suspension of Voice TV, one of the more progressive Thai TV stations which is owned by Thaksin’s children and often gives a platform to those critical of the military.The move has been seen as an attempt by the junta to closely control all public discourse in the build up to the election. They have already enforced draconian rules around campaigning on social media.Voice TV executive Mekin Petplai condemned the move. “Voice TV is of the view it has repeatedly been treated unfairly” said Mekin, adding that the station would fight the NBCT’s “abuse of power.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb2acd6b486f2e9f14cbc2b0cde4a98b5f6406f/0_250_2848_1708/master/2848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=216c40ee307d70bf6053e4d4828bb2a1","title":"us military chief says little to no change in north koreas military ability","story":"General tells Senate committee US and allies still at risk and regime’s military training continues uncheckedThe commander of US forces in South Korea has said he has seen “little to no verifiable change” in North Korea’s military capabilities, just weeks away from a second summit between Donald Trump and regime leader Kim Jong-un.General Robert Abrams, the new head of US Forces Korea, said last year’s summit between the two leaders had helped reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula, but had not led to substantive changes.Trump and Kim met in June last year in a bid to resolve tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear program, and the two signed off on a vaguely-worded document in which Kim pledged to work towards “the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”.After the first summit, Trump tweeted that “there was no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea” and that “everybody can now feel much safer”.Abrams told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday: “Little to no verifiable change has occurred and North Korea’s military capabilities and that North Korea was continuing its winter military training at historic norms.“Further, North Korea’s conventional and asymmetric military capabilities along with their continued development of advanced conventional systems remains unchecked. These capabilities continue to hold the United States, the Republic of Korea and our regional allies at risk.”Trump and Kim are set to meet in Hanoi on 27 and 28 February for a second summit.Abrams noted that it had been 440 days since North Korea’s last “provocative action” and credited diplomatic efforts and international sanctions for leading to a “significant reduction in tension”.Despite the bonhomie of Kim and Trump’s first meeting, progress has since stalled with the two sides disagreeing over what Kim’s pledge means.Analysts say tangible progress on denuclearisation will be needed if the talks are to avoid being dismissed as “reality TV”.After that first summit, Trump called off large-scale joint exercises with South Korea.Abrams said “it is necessary to maintain a postured and ready force to deter any possible aggressive actions,” but stressed that the two allied militaries continue to train together at a lower level.Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8acc7274bf6df03401620b17befcd178319f4d6/0_88_5241_3146/master/5241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaef4dd6d663eb0df3452bd7a04d34f5","title":"iranians mark the 40th anniversary of the islamic revolution in pictures","story":"Hundreds of thousands of students, clerics, soldiers and black-clad women holding small children thronged streets across Iran to mark the toppling of the shah – many carrying portraits of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died in 1989, and Iran’s current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3791721.1550006454!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"almost 80 000 women waiting up to 27 weeks for smear test results hse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnne O’Connor, HSE interim director general, will appear before the Oireachtas Health Committee on Wednesday morning.

Some of our existing providers have managed to reduce the wait times and we continue to work with others to try and find additional capacity,” her statement says.SupportsShe is also expected to outline how the HSE is providing a range of supports to women affected by the CervicalCheck controversy, including through the provision of 602 medical cards and the upgrading of eligibility for another 91 medical card holders, as well as the reimbursement of €1.2 million in expenses and costs to those affected.The HSE will also address recent controversies around women who have not yet got access to their slides.Ms O’Connor will say that 109 out of 118 slide requests have been dealt with in an average 25 days but there are nine still being processed.The HSE will also commit to introducing HPV screening “as soon as possible”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Gift vouchers that used person\u0026rsquos familiar name have often been refused by airlinesFianna F\u0026aacuteil says RSA target waiting time \u0026lsquofar from reality\u0026rsquo in most test centresIrish students may stay home from UK over fees uncertainty, Oireachtas committee hearsO\u0026rsquoBrien says articles wrongly meant he was among borrowers linked to financial crisisDepartment looking at parking sites for HGVs as part of no-deal Brexit planningOireachtas Health Committee to hear how HSE plans to address backlogGovernment concerned over companies low-balling for tenders for children\u0026rsquos hospitalOnly drivers in Bogota and Rome spent more time stuck in carsFears expressed by some members of Cabinet about safetyNone of the 14 children in these \u0026lsquovery robust\u0026rsquo units has been convicted of a crimeMazars says checks and balances failed to protect board from project price spirallingDirect provision centre opposed on grounds \u0026lsquovillage has no services or facilities for them\u0026rsquoAssaults on staff and resignations result in Special Care Units running under capacityGRA says it is coming under pressure from membersParis Agreement on climate change would also boost economic growth in the EUPublic health nurse denies stealing over \u0026euro11,000 belonging to elderly Cork pensionerClaims backstop would allow Dublin exercise \u0026lsquogovernmental functions\u0026rsquo in N Ireland\u0026lsquoWe have a real concern that some companies have been low-balling, coming in with very low tender prices to get the contract\u0026rsquoOffaly TD criticises some colleagues for speaking in \u0026lsquopersonal capacity\u0026rsquo at interviewsJudge bans driver for seven years, accepting he had undiagnosed sleep apnoea and did not deliberately put public at risk"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3791673.1550003600!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit parking lorries at dublin airport considered to avoid traffic jams","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOne solution being considered under the Government’s no-deal Brexit contingency planning could see lorries being held at Dublin Airport  or elsewhere away from the cityThe Department of Transport is exploring whether it can park lorries at one of Dublin Airport’s long-term car parks to avoid possible traffic jams on routes into Dublin Port after Brexit. As part of the Government’s contingency planning for the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal at the end of next month, the department is assessing parking sites for trucks and other heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) in case there is congestion on the M1, M50, Dublin Port Tunnel and around the port.Growing fears about the UK leaving the EU without a deal has led to concerns about the knock-on effect of Customs delays for trucks boarding ferries to Britain on traffic around Dublin city centre. Traffic congestionEU regulations prohibit the build-up of traffic in a tunnel, which in the event of Brexit-related traffic congestion heading to the port, would force the closure of the tunnel and a need for alternative routes.One solution being considered under the Government’s no-deal contingency planning could see lorries being held at a parking site, at the airport or elsewhere away from the city. HGVs would then be released to avoid a build-up of traffic on the main routes around the port until congestion eases.Dublin Airport manages long-term parking at sites near the junction of the M1, north to Belfast, and the M50 ringroad around Dublin, about 5km from the northern entrance to the tunnel. The airport’s operator, DAA, said it was contacted by the department late last week to see whether its long-term parking could be used to hold lorries heading to the port should there be congestion from new border and customs checks for vehicles heading to UK-bound ferries post-Brexit. “We will respond in due course,” said a DAA spokesman.Contingency plansThe department said that it, along with other departments, was undertaking a range of contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit and that one of the plans was assessing the potential impact on traffic around the city “particularly in the area of Dublin Port, Port environs, the Port Tunnel and M1M50.”“A number of sites are being considered as parking areas for HGVs should one be required, including a site at Dublin Airport, and the department is contact with DAA on this,” said a spokeswoman for the department.Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which manages the M50 and the port tunnel, said it was working with “relevant stakeholders” on planning for a no-deal Brexit and that it would “do our part to assist where we can.”Dublin City Council has previously said that the ban on HGVs passing through the city centre would only be lifted due to Brexit-related delays at the port “in exceptional circumstances”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Collins CourtsDenis O’Brien had no problem with being called “a buccaneer” but alleges he was defamed by a newspaper for portraying him as a “developer king” in a “gang” of 22 that bankrupted the country.The businessman was being cross-examined on the fifth day of his libel action against the publisher of the Sunday Business Post over articles in March 2015.He claims he was defamed by being wrongly included in the “gang” who owed €26 billion to the banks at the time of the 2008 financial crisis and were characterised as being responsible for the collapse of the banks.What followed was another colourful back-and-forth between barrister and businessman on his fourth day in the witness box in Court 25 of the Four Courts, where there was standing room only.Michael McDowell SC, for the newspaper, asked O’Brien whether he was seriously suggesting that the Sunday Independent was being complimentary in describing him as a buccaneer in a 2012 article about his loans to Anglo Irish Bank when he was taking issue with the Sunday Business Post including him in a “gang”.McDowell read out the dictionary definition of “buccaneer” as “a pirate, originally one operating in the Caribbean, who acts in a recklessly adventurous and often unscrupulous way”.“There is a team called the Buccaneers,” replied the businessman, who runs a mobile phone business in the Caribbean, referring to the Athlone rugby team.“It is not a derogatory term in my mind gang is.”?BiographyBut what about the 2010 biography of O’Brien by former  journalist Siobhán Creaton that also described him as being in a gang, asked McDowell.“I never even read the book so I don’t know,” replied O’Brien.“One of the benefits of greatness is that you don’t even have to read the only biography of you ever written,” suggested McDowell, a former minister for justice.The businessman, cradling the Post’s 2015 front page and six inside pages among other papers in the witness box, appeared nonplussed.There were plenty of terse exchanges between them, including over O’Brien’s refusal to disclose details of his loans at Anglo when journalist Tom Lyons, author of a 2012 Sunday Independent report and a co-author of the 2015 articles at issue in the court, sent questions to O’Brien’s spokesman in 2012.O’Brien said repeatedly under questioning that his banking details were private and confidential and that he had a right to keep them private. He was being “polite” in saying that he “had no comment” to the journalist’s questions when others would tell him to “get off” and “get lost”.“It could have been stronger than that,” he said.McDowell later took O’Brien through the rest of the “gang”.The businessman said he found none of others “reprehensible” – McDowell’s word – except for “convicted fraudster” Achilleas Kallakis, who was on the list.There was nothing defamatory about being included in the article, McDowell suggested to O’Brien, as “nobody thought the worse of you”.“It was a hatchet job, page by page,” replied the businessman, holding copies of the newspaper.Lighter momentsThere were lighter moments as McDowell challenged O’Brien on his assertion that he was never a property developer, but a long-term property investor, asking him about his property dealings.Asked about his one-time efforts to sell his Portuguese golf resort Quinta do Lago for €220 million, O’Brien said his wife encouraged him to sell the estate because guests were coming up to him to ask about cutting the grass on the golf greens and giving their view on the speed of the greens.“She said, ‘It is not a place where you can go and relax’ so I said I would sell it,” O’Brien said.“In the end, my mother said she would be very upset if I sold it and I listen to my mother.”His mother “prevailed,” he said, and “she won the argument”.“So your wife has to put up with it?” asked McDowell.“Like all wives do, Mr McDowell,” replied O’Brien."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3791649.1550002699!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin one of worst cities in world for traffic congestion","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tResearch from motor data company Inrix suggests Dublin commuters spent a total of 246 hours or more than 10 full days in their cars in 2018. Photograph: Alan Betson Dublin is now one of the worst cities in the world to be a driver, with commuters spending almost 250 hours stuck in cars travelling at less than 10km per hour last year.Research from motor data company Inrix suggests Dublin commuters spent a total of 246 hours or more than 10 full days in their cars in 2018.Of the more than 200 cities in 38 countries surveyed, only drivers in Bogota and Rome spent more time stuck in traffic: 272 and 254 hours respectively.Slowest speedsWhen it comes to speeds travelled at peak times, the news was even worse for Dublin’s motorists. Drivers in the capital travelled at the slowest city centre speeds with the average speed travelled put at just 9.6 kilometres per hour at peak times.The data on Dublin, as with all cities, was collated from a wide variety of sources, measuring car movements for six months between February and July of 2017 and 2018.Trevor Reed, transport analyst at Inrix who authored the report, told The  the company uses a “mosaic of data” to graph a detailed picture of traffic patterns, including anonymised in-car sat-nav and mobile phone based GPS data, and sensor information provided by various transportation departments.Traffic movements are then calculated as it passes a system of parameters in each city.While Dublin is among the worst cities for drivers, when all the impacts of traffic congestion including costs of motoring, distances travelled and traffic jams, Moscow was deemed to be the worst city for motorists followed by Istanbul and Bogota.‘Stuck in traffic’“This is not the sort of list you want to see your name on and being close to the top when it comes to being stuck in traffic is not a proud boast,” said the AA’s Conor Faughnan.He stressed that while there were multiple methodologies for measuring congestion “no matter what one is used, Dublin will never do well. The fact is it is a congested city and when the economy is growing there is always more congestion and that is what we are seeing now.”He said that if the traffic problems the city are to be tackled in a meaningful way, money will have to be spent on public transport and the manner in which land in the city centre is used will have to be addressed.“This is a medium-size. European city of and we have no excuse for being on a list like this,” he said.“It is absurd for a relatively small city to feature so prominently and it shows that we have to see more investment in public transport, a better use of land and the provision of more cycling facilities until that happens it always going to remain a congested city.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3791715.1550006242!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"senior garda examining security for ministers after simon harris incident","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinisters  discussed the episode which saw protesters block Mr Harris, his wife and their three-week-old daughter in their home in Greystones, Co Wicklow.

Gardaí said the demonstrators left the scene peacefully after an hour.Sources said fears were expressed by some members of the Cabinet that they could be at risk of similar incidents, and it was noted that Irish politicians are accessible to voters.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke on the issue at Cabinet, as did Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan. Mr Flanagan said an assistant commissioner in An Garda Síochána is examining ministerial security arrangements, although it is understood he did not get into specifics.Sources said Mr Flanagan’s comment was vague and may not have been intended to give much detail away.One source said the families of Ministers had become concerned and anxious at the latest developments, and at previous reports of female Ministers also being targeted.Some sources said it was mentioned in passing at the meeting that Cabinet members used to have full-time Garda drivers who also served as ministerial protection.Garda driversThe Fine Gael-Labour coalition replaced Garda drivers with ministerial drivers in 2011, although some senior figures – such as the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Justice – have Garda protection.Some Ministers have also had the risks to them assessed by An Garda Síochána.Mr Harris said earlier this week that the use of the word protest to describe what happened “somewhat gives a legitimacy to what was plain and simple intimidation of my family, intimidation of my neighbours and intimidation of my community”.He said a legitimate protest is something that has a very important role in a democratic society. “What happened yesterday to myself, to my wife, to my young baby and to our neighbours was not protest , was absolutely not protest.

Lowest tenderThe contract for the children’s hospital was awarded to the lowest tender (€637 million) but the costs have rocketed since to an expected €1.7 billion.Mr Donohoe indicated yesterday that there was a concern that the cost may escalate further, saying that the incoming chairman of the board would review the existing estimates. “I believe that is the best cost estimate that we have available to us at the moment, and Fred Barry when he takes over his role as chairperson of the board will be able to give us an assessment as to whether there’s any future change possible,” he said.The Government defended its record of delivering many capital projects on time and on budget but Ministers and the Taoiseach said they accepted responsibility for the dramatic inflation in the costs of the national children’s hospital.Yesterday, the Cabinet agreed on a series of measures to pay for this year’s overspend on the children’s hospital.However, Mr Donohoe was unable to supply any details for the €24 million in savings from the health budget – which is just half of the €50 million figure that was identified for savings from the Department of Health previously.Later, a spokeswoman for Minister for Health Simon Harris said that the saving of €24 million would be achieved by “delivering some smaller capital works such as repairs and replacements over a longer period of time”.Mr Harris delivered a personal apology to the Dáil yesterday for his failure to reveal the overspending concerns in a reply to Fianna Fáil TD Barry Cowen last year. Meanwhile, a new report has examined the reasons behind the massive cost escalation at the hospital. The report by Mazars, the final version of which was issued on December 17th, 2018, was commissioned by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.The report, which has been seen by The , finds that the project’s “fundamental systems and checks and balances failed to protect the board from a large sudden increase in the cost of construction”.It found that the capital cost budgeting process “failed to determine and therefore secure the necessary capital budget” from the beginning of the process.It also found that the budgeting process “failed to properly estimate the likely future costs of the project within the stated contingency limits”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3791070.1549978908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit may calls on mps to hold their nerve on deal","story":"UK Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday (February 12) she believed she could reach a Brexit deal that parliament could support, allowing Britain to leave the European Union on March 29.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Britain’s prime minister Theresa May listening to a reply by opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to her statement on Brexit in the House of Commons in London. Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesBritish prime minister Theresa May has called on MPs to “hold their nerve” and come together behind an EU withdrawal deal which will deliver Brexit on time on March 29th.Addressing the House of Commons a fortnight after MPs voted for her to go back to Brussels and replace the backstop, Mrs May acknowledged that she would need “some time” to hold talks with the EU. The backstop would ensure there was no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland. She said that a planned House of Commons debate on Thursday will be on an amendable motion reaffirming the House’s decision on January 29th that it supported the government’s efforts to find an alternative for the backstop and recognising that talks are ongoing.Mrs May pledged to return to parliament on February 26th, if no deal has been secured before that time, to report back on progress and trigger a further MPs’ vote the following day.“We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this house requires and deliver Brexit on time,” Mrs May told the House of Commons.“By getting the changes we need to the backstop by protecting and enhancing workers’ rights and environmental protections and by enhancing the role of Parliament in the next phase of negotiations I believe we can reach a deal that this House can support.“We can deliver for the people and the communities that voted for change two-and-a-half years ago — and whose voices for too long have not been heard.“We can honour the result of the referendum.“And we can set this country on course for the bright future that every part of this United Kingdom deserves.“That is this Government’s mission. We shall not stint in our efforts to fulfil it.”Running down the clockLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the prime minister of “running down the clock” in the hope that MPs will be “blackmailed” by the fear of a no-deal Brexit into supporting “a deeply flawed deal”.“This is an irresponsible act,” said Mr Corbyn. “She is playing for time and playing with people’s jobs, our economic security and the future of our industry.”Mr Corbyn accused Mrs May of refusing to listen to his alternative deal, involving permanent customs union membership, a close alignment with the single market and matching EU workplace and environmental protections.“I urge all members across this House to think about the damage the Prime Minister’s strategy is doing — the threat to industry and skilled jobs in communities across Britain,” he said.“Now is not the time to stand idly by, now is the time to stand up and do the right thing: to rule out no deal and back Labour’s alternative plan.”PuristEarlier the leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom said MPs should not be “purist” about how Mrs May secures changes to the Brexit backstop arrangement.The United Kingdom is on course to leave the European Union on March 29th without a deal unless May can convince it to amend the deal she agreed in November.Ms Leadsom, said MPs would back May’s deal if there were assurances the backstop was time-limited or the UK was allowed to leave it unilaterally, suggesting the deal itself did not need to be renegotiated. “The point is to ensure the UK cannot be held in a backstop permanently, how it’s achieved is not something to be purist about,” Ms Leadsom told BBC radio.EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Monday the EU would agree to tweak the political declaration on EU-UK ties after Brexit that forms part of the package, to reflect a plan for a closer future relationship that could obviate the need for the contentious backstop.“It’s clear from our side that we are not going to reopen the withdrawal agreement but we will continue our discussion in the coming days,” Barnier said.Running down the clock?The British parliament is set to hold a debate on Brexit on February 14th but with just 45 days until Britain leaves the bloc, no date has yet been set for another “meaningful” vote on Mrs May’s deal.Ms Leadsom said another vote would be held once the issue around the Irish backstop had been resolved.“It’s not running down the clock.

But nowhere is the prospect of regime change more likely than Sudan.Almost since the revolt began on December 19, rapidly spreading to towns and cities across Sudan, young medics have been at the forefront of the protests demanding Mr Bashir’s regisnation. They have also been among its most prominent victims, none more so than Babiker Abdelhamid, who was shot dead in Khartoum on January 17.Dr Babiker, who was 27, was only one of 45 people who have been killed by the security forces since the protests began, according to human rights groups. But the nature of his death, and the controversy it has ignited, has become a rallying call for the protesters, increasing rather than diminishing their determination to oust the president.According to witnesses, Dr Babiker walked out of his home, where he had been treating protesters,  and attempted to beg security officers to allow him to take the wounded to hospital. Moments later, a gunshot rang out and an hour later he was dead.“He walked down the street slowly, with his hands raised,” a colleague said. “He was trying to tell them he had critical cases and to ask them to reopen the road to Royal Care Hospital, which they had cut off. Then he was killed.Anti-government protesters rally in Khartoum, SudanFacing mounting outrage, President Bashir attempted to blame the killing on a foreign plot to bring chaos to Sudan. “The doctor who was killed… was killed by a weapon that did not belong to the army, or the NISS (National Intelligence and Security Services, or police,” he told supporters at a rally in the south of the country.“He was killed by someone among the demonstrators.”Yet there is no question that Sudan’s doctors, the most formidable group in a growing array of opponents to the regime, have borne the brunt of Mr Bashir’s increasingly violent and desperate response to the protests. At least one other doctor, Muawiya Khalil, has been killed, allegedly shot dead inside his house. Many more have been arrested, including the head of the Sudan Doctors Syndicate, his deputy and other members of the executive committee.Medics and nurses were beaten up after security forces raided two hospitals in Khartoum, firing live ammunition and teargas into the wards before dragging wounded protesters off their beds and taking them to secret detention centres. The assault on the medical profession partly reflects regime anger at doctors after they called a strike, encouraged other professions to follow suit and then threw open private hospitals to treat the wounded for free.But it is also an indication of the regime’s longstanding fear of the medical profession and the reverence with which it is held in Sudanese society.After seizing power in 1989, Mr Bashir banned independent trade unions, locked up and tortured opponents in secret prisons known as “ghost houses” and silenced dissent.But the doctors refused to be cowed, staging a strike within months of the coup — the regime responded by allegedly torturing to death one of the organisers at one of the ghost houses — and several more since.The medical profession’s opposition to the regime was driven by the distaste of secular doctors towards the coalition of Islamists and military figures that have run it and which allowed bin Laden to live in the country from 1991 to 1996. There was particular fury that Islamist militants were allowed to infiltrate a medical university in Khartoum, where students — including at least 16 Britons — were sent to join ISIL in Syria.But resentment is more deep-seated too. Sudan’s medical service was once among Africa’s most efficient. The Kitchener School of Medicine produced some of the continent’s best doctors.Tear gas is seen as Sudanese demonstrators take part in an an anti-government protest in KhartoumBut in recent decades, the health system has all but collapsed. As the Bashir regime erted government funds towards the military, slashing health expenditure to just two percent of the budget, once-functioning state hospitals became understaffed and poorly equipped. Medicines ran in short supply, free healthcare was mostly abandoned. Corrupt government officials plundered hospitals and ran dodgy procurement tenders. Unable to save lives, doctors were sometimes beaten up by the parents of children who had died in their care.Doctors’ attempts to galvanise public anger largely failed, however, with many Sudanese still too scared to confront their government. But an economic crisis in recent years, the legacy of US sanctions, lifted in 2016, and economic mismanagement in a country ranked by Transparency International as among the six most corrupt in the world, has changed the dynamic. Starved of cash, the government began printing money, sending inflation soaring to 70 percent, second only to Venezuela.Forced to adopt austerity measures, Mr Bashir lifted subsidies on basic staples, causing bread prices to treble. The rapid devaluation of the Sudanese pound had meant that the price of medicines, which are mostly imported, soaring by between 150 percent and 300 percent in the last 12 months.December’s protests began spontaneously in the city of Atbara, but they were quickly given direction and purpose by the Sudanese Professionals Organisation, an umbrella group dominated by doctors, which has marshalled near daily protests and industrial action across the country.“Demands for major healthcare changes have been repeatedly ignored over the year,” doctors’ groups said in a statement. “There has been a blatant policy of  systematically destroying the once free national health service. Our only option, coupled by our professional duty, was to escalate our protests.”The Bashir regime has thwarted previous protests, killing some 180 people during the last significant uprising in 2013. Yet Sudan observers say that, this time, the fear factor has been broken, with violence increasing rather than deterring the protesters’ determination.Other professionals have joined demands for Mr Bashir’s resignation, including professors at Khartoum University, another hallowed colonial institution that began its days as the Gordon Memorial College in 1902. Other groups, most significantly dock workers at Port Sudan, have joined the strikes.And even Sudan’s normally cautious opposition, sensing Mr Bashir’s growing vulnerability, has come out in support of the protests. Last week, Sadiq al-Mahdi, the bearded Oxford-educated former prime minister overthrown by Mr Bashir in 1989, demanded the president’s resignation.A Sudanese protester carries a portrait of President Omar al-Bashir with Arabic writing that reads \u0026#34down and that is all\u0026#34 Some observers see Mr al-Mahdi, great-grandson of Muhammad Ahmed, the Mahdi whose warriors killed General Gordon in Khartoum in 1885, as a potential candidate to head a transitional government — even though he is 83.President Bashir is not beaten yet. Middle Eastern states say they support the regime and Qatar, which has embarked on a multi-million pound development of the British-built port at Suakin, may bail him out financially. Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group, the Kremlin-linked outfit that has fought in Syria and Ukraine, have been spotted in Khartoum and are possibly assisting the regime’s repression.Yet there are rumours of splits within the regime, with even some of his generals reportedly sensing that only by sacrificing Mr Bashir will the protests, increasingly well organised and ever more determined, end.Some observers say there may be a peaceful way out, with suggestions that the president would be willing to step down if the International Criminal Court dropped its case accusing him of involvement in killing hundreds of thousands during the suppression of a rebellion in the Darfur region.Mohammed Ibrahim, a Sudanese-British billionaire and prominent critic of the Bashir regime, has led calls for the indictment to be lifted, warning that otherwise the demise of one of the Arab world’s most stubborn leaders is likely to be protracted and violent affair.“If that is going to save lives, if it is going to save us from a bloody civil war, let the man go in peace,” Mr Ibrahim told the BBC.Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Comment: Radio 4\u0026#39s Fatwa shows why the repercussions of the Salman Rushie Satanic Verses controversy are still felt 30 years onComment: NATO will be key to any vision of a \u0026#39Global Britain\u0026#39Steven Berkoff interview: ‘Harvey Weinstein is a victim of his time’Thai princess apologises for \u0026#39causing problems\u0026#39 after brief election bidBrexit latest news: Chief negotiator under fire after \u0026#39warning\u0026#39 of long delay to BrexitWomen are put off smear tests because they worry it will reveal promiscuity, Cancer Research survey findsBritish rapper 21 Savage to be released on bond amid US deportation threatNet migration could increase by 100,000 under Government\u0026#39s post-Brexit regime, says campaign groupSocial media firms face new laws banning images that glamorise knife crimeNASA about to pull plug on Mars rover which has been silent for 8 monthsNHS GPs get go-ahead for online Skype appointmentsComment: An unholy alliance of Left and Right could push the PM into a no-deal Brexit she doesn\u0026#39t wantJihadists could face up to 10 years in prison if they return to the UK under new laws Transgender man’s fight for his child to be motherless opposed by GovernmentSir Philip Green is not \u0026#39worthy\u0026#39 of his knighthood says ministerThe Duchess of Sussex joins the \u0026#39woke white\u0026#39 style brigade -

making as much money as possible from the trade in endangered species.But his actions have inadvertently led to a significant increase in the number of exotic birds being nurtured in captivity at wildlife centres in this country.And ironically that may eventually lead to their offspring being released back into the wild, thereby contributing to an increase in the numbers of their breed in their native environment.It can now be revealed that the renowned International Centre for Birds of Prey (ICBP), in Gloucestershire, has successfully hatched the eggs seized by customs officials when Lendrum entered the country in June last year.As a result it now has three rare Cape Vultures, which became an endangered species in 2015. There is thought to currently be only one other British bird centre with this species, in Wales, making their presence at ICBP a particular boon for visitors.“We have never had Cape Vultures at the centre so this is another species we are able to learn about and study,” said Holly Cale, curator at the ICBP. “It’s something that is likely to attract a lot of interest once visitors get to know about them.”The eggs seized from Lendrum - who revelled in the title of the “Pablo Escobar of the falcon egg trade” - also included five African fish eagles, eight African black sparrowhawks and two African hawk-eagles, all of which have now been successfully raised them into young adults.Although an unknown number of these birds are currently in captivity at the ICBP and other bird sanctuaries, their arrival at Newent has led to an overall increase in their total number in Britain.Lendrum, 56, was jailed for three years and one month after pleading guilty to four offences on the second day of his trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court last month.He had attempted to smuggle 19 eggs from South Africa strapped to his chest in a sling hidden beneath a heavy coat, in all likelihood intending to sell them on to a breeder who would then sell them to domestic and foreign buyers.These might have included legitimate bird sanctuaries unaware of the provenance of the birds.Jemima Parry-Jones, director of the ICBP, said: “This kind of crime is heartbreaking because it put everybody like us into disrepute and at the same time Lendrum impacting the wild bird population in their native countries by depleting it.”The chicks being raised at the International Centre for Birds of Prey in Newent Ms Parry-Jones, who was a witness at Lendrum’s trial, said the breeding programme to raise chicks from the eggs illegally imported by Lendrum had required great care and attention.On June 26 we had a call from customs saying they had stopped someone at Heathrow with 19 fertile eggs strapped to his body.Two had already hatched by the time we got there and one black sparrowhawk was broken in Lendrum\u0027s body pouch.,” she said, adding:An African fish eagle died three days after hatching due to a yolk infection so we were left with 17 birds altogether. We collected them in a portable incubator and brought them back to an incubator at the centre until they started to hatch. They were then fed three times a day and weighed. Now they have grown the birds are fed once a day.”Although hand reared - and therefore able to live only in captivity - it is hoped any offspring they produce will eventually be released back into their native environment in southern Africa.Ms Parry-Jones said: We had to hand-rear them which means they cannot go back into the wild because they are too habituated to humans meaning it\u0027s not safe. We will try breeding from these birds and then their young will be parent-reared rather than hand-reared. This means the offspring will be viable to go back to the wild.Lendrum, a former member of the Rhodesian SAS, has a series of bird smuggling convictions ning decades.He claims he was only motivated by compassion, insisting there was no money in it and that he only retrieved dead eggs for research.Please review our commenting policyComment: Radio 4\u0026#39s Fatwa shows why the repercussions of the Salman Rushie Satanic Verses controversy are still felt 30 years onComment: NATO will be key to any vision of a \u0026#39Global Britain\u0026#39Steven Berkoff interview: ‘Harvey Weinstein is a victim of his time’Thai princess apologises for \u0026#39causing problems\u0026#39 after brief election bidBrexit latest news: Chief negotiator under fire after \u0026#39warning\u0026#39 of long delay to BrexitWomen are put off smear tests because they worry it will reveal promiscuity, Cancer Research survey findsBritish rapper 21 Savage to be released on bond amid US deportation threatNet migration could increase by 100,000 under Government\u0026#39s post-Brexit regime, says campaign groupSocial media firms face new laws banning images that glamorise knife crimeNASA about to pull plug on Mars rover which has been silent for 8 monthsNHS GPs get go-ahead for online Skype appointmentsComment: An unholy alliance of Left and Right could push the PM into a no-deal Brexit she doesn\u0026#39t wantJihadists could face up to 10 years in prison if they return to the UK under new laws Transgender man’s fight for his child to be motherless opposed by GovernmentSir Philip Green is not \u0026#39worthy\u0026#39 of his knighthood says ministerThe Duchess of Sussex joins the \u0026#39woke white\u0026#39 style brigade - and nods to Jackie KennedyBack Theresa May\u0026#39s deal or prepare for a long delay to Brexit, PM\u0026#39s chief negotiator \u0026#39warns MPs\u0026#39350 UK jihadists in Syria face up to 10 years\u0026#39 jail  in anti-terror crackdownWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/12/TELEMMGLPICT000187849757_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green not worthy knighthood says minister","story":"Sir Philip Green is not “worthy” of his knighthood, a government minister has said as pressure mounts on him to be stripped of the honour.Margot James, the digital minister, said Sir Philip’s alleged behaviour towards his colleagues, combined with his handling of BHS employee’s pensions, meant stripping him of his knighthood was a “real possibility”.Sir Philip used payouts, some totalling more than £1million, to silence allegations of sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying.The billionaire dropped his legal action against this newspaper days before a High Court trial where he was likely to have had to give evidence in the witness box.“I feel he is not worthy of a knighthood,” Ms James...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

From finding love to toppling corrupt governments, this multi-billion dollar industry – with sharing as its organising principle – can be a force for good.As a former science and innovation minister, I know we are only at the start of this technological revolution. And I want Britain to be the go‑to place in Europe where digital platforms – including social media and messaging behemoths like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Tinder – can flourish.But that also means recognising that this great leap forward in connecting people can cause harm, to iniduals and society at large. The argument that the web should be beyond careful regulation is long past its sell by date. Social media giants have come of age and are making vast profits. Now they must take on the big responsibilities we expect of all big companies.To lead the world, therefore, Britain must set a new standard for these firms: to enhance their reputation and sustain their business models for the long term, by protecting their users.The time to act is now. A growing body of research has linked social media use to a range of mental health problems, from depression and anxiety to eating disorders and sleep problems. As the generation that use social media the most, it is those aged 16 to 24 that are being hardest hit.Duty of care puffA report by the Royal Society for Public Health suggested that social media can be more addictive than alcohol or cigarettes. Cyber‑bullying and grooming are rife on some platforms. The tragic suicide of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who was exposed to distressing material about depression and suicide on Instagram, brings home the dark side of social media. Systems designed to bring people together are leaving many young people feeling isolated, alone and alienated.The harmful effects extend beyond this, however. From extremism and intellectual property scams to subverting our democratic processes, the power of social media can all too easily be perverted.So we need a new approach that all social media sites will adopt – we need something that will go viral, so to speak. As the use of social media is increasingly universal, any solutions have to be systemic – and taken seriously by all the players in the industry. This is why I am backing the Daily ’s duty of care campaign.Put simply, social media giants should have a statutory duty of care to their users, obliging them to take more responsibility for reasonably foreseeable damage caused to iniduals and the public through use of their platforms. The idea of a duty of care set out in statute is not new. For decades, companies have had a duty of care to their employees as well as employers. As Professor Lorna Woods and William Perrin point out, there is no reason why a similar system cannot be evolved for the tech industry.Real and fast progress is vital. But this will only be achieved if the tech giants take the lead in working with a willing government to design this new statutory regime. The attention paid to this issue by this newspaper and the dignified campaign of Molly Russell’s parents have forced Instagram to welcome the idea of a duty of care. That is a good start, but it will take more than words to mitigate the harmful effects of social media.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreEffective leadership involves tech giants rethinking the design of their services in a safety-conscious way. Just as passenger, public and environmental safety is critical to the car manufacturing industry, social media platforms need to see prevention of harm as core to their business. We, rightly, expect more from business, with the demands on them to operate responsibly – wherever they are – increasingly daily.Tech giants spend serious money understanding their users. Investing in tools to limit the anxiety, insecurity and depression their services can foster (for example) should be part of their license to operate.If social media companies want to be a force for good, they must share the responsibility and lead the way in dealing with the bad.

But it seems they\u0027ll be waiting for a little longer.The new wireless charging case was first seen in 2017, when Apple said that it would ship a new charging mat called AirPower that would be able to charge the iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods in a special case all at once. It said then that it would sell the new case separately, allowing people to switch over without having to buy new earphones.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

That would mean the new case would ship with older AirPods inside for the first few months, the report claims.When the AirPods 2 do arrive, they are widely rumoured to bring always-on Hey Siri so that people can instantly speak to the voice assistant, health tracking capabilities, and other upgraded features. They might also bring a new colour option, potentially allowing people to buy black as well as white versions of the earphones.The existence of the\u0026nbspnew ear buds appeared to have been revealed by an upcoming iPhone update, which seemed to include references to features that are expected to arrive with AirPods 2.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A list of 20 of the most burning questions businesses have has been put together by the British Chambers of Commerce, which said that many of the unanswered questions “reflect fundamental aspects of how companies operate”.The list comes days after a number of the UK’s biggest food and drink companies threatened to stop cooperating with the government on anything that is not connected to Brexit.

A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayPolice surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester Conservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve Bray“There is a very real risk that a lack of clear, actionable information from government will leave firms, their people and their communities hung out to dry.” He added: “Even those companies trying their hardest to get ready are still in the dark on important matters from contracts through to customs. Many others, who took the decision to wait for the political process to conclude before acting, would face sudden and costly adjustments if a deal is not reached.“It is little wonder that many firms have been holding back on investment, stockpiling, and even opening offices and moving operations and jobs elsewhere. The imperative remains to avoid a messy and disorderly exit on 29 March, but businesses need answers they can base decisions on, no matter the outcome. The lack of clear, precise answers is now causing real damage to many businesses, and to the wider economy.”The questions put together by the BCC are as follows: What tariffs will my company need to pay when importing goods to the UK from the EU and rest of the world?When will the UK Government launch an official market access database to provide this information?If any trade agreements with third countries are operational on the day after Brexit, what rules of origin will I need to comply with?Will I still be able to fly people andor goods between the UK and the EU after Brexit day – or could travel be disrupted?I know I will need to register for an EORI number. How simple will it be for me to register for any other new registration requirements or processes?How will my lead times be impacted by new customs procedures?Will any of the EU-FTA agreements be rolled over or replaced on a bilateral basis in the event of no deal?Will I be able to use any trade preferences with any markets?Will there be confirmation that I will be able to continue importing tariff free goods from developing and least developed countries under the generalised system of preferences (GSP) after 29 March, 2019?Will there be new safety and security requirements and inspections at the UK-EU border that my company will need to deal with? Where will inspections be held?What system will I be using to input customs data – will HMRC’s new Customs Declaration Service be ready in time for 29 March, 2019?What procedures will my company face trading between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?Will this be different to operating at any other UK border?Will staff spending longer than 90 out of 180 days in the EU be subject to further administration, costs or visas?Will my business be able to move skilled staff members between the UK and the EU after 29 March and if so, under what conditions?Will I need to become VAT-registered in every EU Member State where my firm has clients?Which regulator will be overseeing my business after 29 March, 2019, and what rules do I need to follow?Is the UK government going to charge businesses for the creation of new regulatory agencies in the UK?If my company is in dispute with another in the EU, what form of resolution and means of redress will be available to my business after 29 March, 2019?Will my business have to pay roaming charges in the EU after 29 March, 2019?Will my business continue to be able to hold and transfer data and personal information without any interruptions after 29 March, 2019?We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The hunt for such alternatives inevitably leads to examples of other borders and it is usually only a matter of time before someone volunteers the Switzerland-France border as a model. Switzerland is in Schengen (so no need for passport checks) and regulations on goods are broadly aligned with those of the EU. Switzerland is not in the EU’s customs union nor its VAT regime, and that means border checks are required. Its watches and cuckoo clocks literally run like clockwork, so, the argument goes, must its borders.But it’s not as simple as that. As the Swiss Federal Customs Administration makes clear, even though they have the latest technology and much paperwork is done away from the border, there is still some physical infrastructure and delays of up to four hours if a lorry is searched.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 2018 Switzerland launched a new IT-based customs transformation programme. This programme aims to simplify, harmonise and fully digitise customs tax and duty collection processes. It should be in place by 2026.However, this programme will not make controls at the border redundant. Quite the opposite. Because routine administrative work and bureaucratic procedures will be replaced by IT-based solutions, personnel will be freed up. These people will be used to strengthen security, especially for control functions and reinforcement of criminal prosecution. Some of these functions will continue to apply at the border. Hence, even with a highly technologically advanced customs management system, controls at the border will not become obsolete and nor will customs infrastructure vanish.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply. If the UK is given “Part 2 listed status”, there would be some extra requirements for travelling pets and owners post-Brexit. “These would require an additional visit to the vet and some additional papers to be carried but would not prevent you from enjoying your trip,” says Eurotunnel.

Norway is not in the customs union either, so the origin of goods must be checked. Again, Norwegian Customs make clear what is required. Although it is technologically advanced, there is still a delay. The average time from when a lorry arrives at the border to when it leaves is about 20 minutes. This includes roughly ten minutes waiting time, three to six minutes of handling time, and the time spent coming off the road to complete the customs process. And there’s physical infrastructure too. All this despite existing agreements on customs facilitation, transit and rules of origin between the EU and the European Free Trade Association states, of which Norway is one.Less often talked about are Andorra and San Marino. Both are small European nations that are in a customs union with the EU. Although Andorra’s treaty only covers goods, its borders with Spain and France are strictly controlled. This is due to the fact that Andorra has no VAT (yet) and is known as low tax territory. Thus, smuggling has always been a concern of the neighbouring countries. The customs union with San Marino covers all goods except coal and steel. It has traditionally kept an open border without checks at its frontier with Italy. However, it levies an import tax, at 17 per cent.The Bulgaria-Turkey border is worse. Turkey is in a customs union with the EU, which removes tariffs and quantitative restrictions in bilateral trade between EU member states and Turkey for the goods covered. It also sets a single external tariff for both the EU and Turkey, so they charge the same duties on imports from non-EU countries.Unlike the customs union covering EU member states, the EU-Turkey agreement is incomplete. It covers industrial goods but not agricultural products (except certain processed agricultural products), coal and steel products, or public procurement.Finally, the border between Turkey and the EU is bureaucratic and lengthy. Lorry drivers need an export declaration, a customs permit, invoices for the products they are transporting, insurance certificates and a transport permit for each EU nation they will drive through. The queues at the border can be up to 17 kilometres long and the wait as much as 30 hours. While Turkey has invested significantly in modernising its border, with checks taking place an hour inland, Bulgarian officials check the paperwork for every truck and x-ray all refrigerated lorries.Which brings us to the US-Canada border. Again, much resource has been put into streamlining this border but there are still delays - the length can be seen online. All of this indicates that regardless of the technological capabilities of the EU’s neighbouring countries, there will be checks and the borders and this means infrastructure.By Professor Catherine Barnard, senior fellow The UK in a Changing Europe and Dr Georges Baur.

What began as a startup is now one of London’s leading destinations for yoga and\u0026nbsppilates, with five studios across the capital and more than 750 classes per week.Created with Sketch.Yoga Inc. The phenomenal popularity of yoga Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sattin had no initial plans to work in the wellbeing industry. “My father was a doctor and really wanted one of his three sons to follow in his footsteps,” he says.“For years, I thought that’s what I was going to do too. But I ended up going to law school and eventually became a lawyer, setting up my own practice when I was 27.”Looking for a better way to relax while studying, Sattin taught himself to meditate and the seeds for an altogether different life were sewn – not that he knew it at the time. In 1985, one of his colleagues who thought he was a little “left of centre” suggested he try yoga and sent Sattin to a private class in northwest London. The experience turned out to be life-changing.Sattin says: “It might sound clichéd but it’s one of these experiences that become more profound when you look back at them. At the time, I just realised instantly that I needed to change.“I was a heavy smoker, I used to smoke 40 cigarettes a day and a drink about 14 cups of coffee with two sugars each. Within three months of practising I quit all of that.” “It wasn’t that I suddenly gave up practising law, shaved my head and wore orange robes, but it was a catalyst for change. It encouraged me to do better.”After 18 years of practising law he decided he had enough in 1996. Sattin agreed to a year’s notice, which gave him time to think about his next steps. He says: “I was involved in the set up of Yo! Sushi and Protocol Multimedia Talent Agency. I was talking to some friends in Los Angeles, who said, ‘Why don’t you do what you love?’ and I realised yoga was what I was the most interested in.” He travelled to the US to see how studios like YogaWorks in Los Angeles and Jivamukti yoga in New York operated. “The aim was to see what they were doing wrong and what I could learn from their mistakes,” Sattin says.“Once I got the concept, I was very passionate about doing it and when you have that passion, people want you to succeed,” he adds.Sattin used his network to fund the company and managed to raise £500,000. In 2000, with the help of a company board, some of whose members he found while walking his golden retriever in Regent’s Park, the first Triyoga studio in Primrose Hill was born.Early investors included David Svendsen, who was then chair\u0026nbspof Microsoft, while Simon Low joined the company to be director of yoga, a role he kept until 2002.If you are a little shy about stepping inside this impressive mecca for yogis, you shouldn’t be. The whole concept was to create a place for all.Sattin says: “From the beginning, the idea was to create a place where anyone could practice yoga. It had to be authentic and we also wanted to have a wide range of classes. I knew from my own experience that people want different things at different times. The number of people who attend Triyoga classes each year“Sometimes you might want something dynamic and sometimes you might want something restorative. We wanted to help our customers to find the type of practice that was appropriate for them.” With its proximity to the London homes of Sadie Frost and Gwyneth Paltrow, who have both attended classes there, the Primrose Hill centre quickly become a byword for glamour – an image that Sattin is visibly uncomfortable with.He says: “When we first opened, our studio Primrose Hill wasn’t quite as cool and glamorous as it is now. It had the feeling of a village and it was quite awkward to get there. It was interesting as an area. We never sought to attract celebrities, our aim was to give time and space to practice to anyone that comes through our doors.” For the\u0026nbspfirst full year, the company’s turnover was £393,000, and in 2017 this jumped to an impressive £6.2m.\u0026nbspMore than 600,000 people attend Triyoga classes every year and in 2015 it opened a\u0026nbspteacher-training academy.A branch opened in Covent Garden in 2003, followed by Soho in 2005, and another two studios in Shoreditch and Ealing opened their doors in 2017.Of course, there were also some obstacles. Triyoga was forced out of its coveted location in Primrose Hill after losing a three-year battle against a development firm. Fortunately, Sattin promptly found an alternative venue in Camden in an old piano factory in Jamestown Road – a short walk away from its original location.Each studio now has a café and a shop. The company also offers teacher training, retreats and holidays. Sattin says: “As we’ve expanded, we’ve tried to get better, and improve our service and our offering. We always had changing rooms and showers – which was quite unusual at the time. But we’ve added cafés, shops and more treatments.“Essentially, we wanted our customers to have a comfy space where they wanted to stay and hangout. We wanted them to feel like they were part of something.” The market has changed considerably since Triyoga first opened its doors nearly 20 years ago. Competition might be more brutal than ever – but Sattin says the quality of the teaching at Triyoga is what makes them different from rivals.He says: “We are passionate with the quality of our teaching and our treatments. We now have 122 teachers, not including those who come for guest’s lessons.“We look at how qualified they are, but also if they teach the way that is right for us. As a basic rule our teachers need to have a minimum of five years’ experience. Each one goes through a thorough interview process and also teaches a class to the team and to our clients.”The company may not have embraced goat yoga, but it has been quick to evolve with the times – last year, Triyoga spearheaded an initiative for Consent Cards, the first of its kind, in response to the #MeToo movement. Sattin explains: “In yoga, some of our students may wish to be corrected, but others just prefer not to be touched. “These allow all students to put a card on their mat, so if they don’t want to be adjusted, the teacher knows without them having to say anything.”The company hosts a triyoga podcast, which Sattin says is all about confronting issues in the wellness world head-on. This include debates about yoga practices in a #MeToo era and the complex relationship between contemporary yoga and eating disorders.Perhaps it is down to the calming effect of yoga, but Sattin is refreshingly humble when talking about the centre’s success. When asked about oversea expansion plans, he says: “We don’t have plans to expand outside of the UK for now. I want to keep our values and continue investing in the right people, look at how we can improve our service and provide even better care for our clients.”We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

It is hobbled by more than £500m of debt and a lot of underperforming stores with high rents that it needs to close.\u0026nbspThe shares’ rapturous response to the lifeline needs to be put in context.

A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayPolice surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester Conservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve Bray“There is a very real risk that a lack of clear, actionable information from government will leave firms, their people and their communities hung out to dry.” He added: “Even those companies trying their hardest to get ready are still in the dark on important matters from contracts through to customs. Many others, who took the decision to wait for the political process to conclude before acting, would face sudden and costly adjustments if a deal is not reached.“It is little wonder that many firms have been holding back on investment, stockpiling, and even opening offices and moving operations and jobs elsewhere. The imperative remains to avoid a messy and disorderly exit on 29 March, but businesses need answers they can base decisions on, no matter the outcome. The lack of clear, precise answers is now causing real damage to many businesses, and to the wider economy.”The questions put together by the BCC are as follows: What tariffs will my company need to pay when importing goods to the UK from the EU and rest of the world?When will the UK Government launch an official market access database to provide this information?If any trade agreements with third countries are operational on the day after Brexit, what rules of origin will I need to comply with?Will I still be able to fly people andor goods between the UK and the EU after Brexit day – or could travel be disrupted?I know I will need to register for an EORI number. How simple will it be for me to register for any other new registration requirements or processes?How will my lead times be impacted by new customs procedures?Will any of the EU-FTA agreements be rolled over or replaced on a bilateral basis in the event of no deal?Will I be able to use any trade preferences with any markets?Will there be confirmation that I will be able to continue importing tariff free goods from developing and least developed countries under the generalised system of preferences (GSP) after 29 March, 2019?Will there be new safety and security requirements and inspections at the UK-EU border that my company will need to deal with? Where will inspections be held?What system will I be using to input customs data – will HMRC’s new Customs Declaration Service be ready in time for 29 March, 2019?What procedures will my company face trading between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?Will this be different to operating at any other UK border?Will staff spending longer than 90 out of 180 days in the EU be subject to further administration, costs or visas?Will my business be able to move skilled staff members between the UK and the EU after 29 March and if so, under what conditions?Will I need to become VAT-registered in every EU Member State where my firm has clients?Which regulator will be overseeing my business after 29 March, 2019, and what rules do I need to follow?Is the UK government going to charge businesses for the creation of new regulatory agencies in the UK?If my company is in dispute with another in the EU, what form of resolution and means of redress will be available to my business after 29 March, 2019?Will my business have to pay roaming charges in the EU after 29 March, 2019?Will my business continue to be able to hold and transfer data and personal information without any interruptions after 29 March, 2019?We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

But the EU again refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – with any negotiations expected to focus on the future relationship between the UK and EU instead“Many businesses are threatened with extinction.”He added: “One in 10 of our members surveyed last week believe that a no-deal Brexit could cause them such damage that they might have to go out of business.”The food and drink bosses’ letter to the government comes weeks after the UK’s biggest retailers, including Sainsbury’s, Asda and Waitrose, warned politicians that \u0026nbspa no-deal Brexit in March will see items disappear from supermarket shelves and could put the UK’s food security at risk. A disorderly Brexit and trading under World Trade Organisation terms would cause “significant disruption” and push up food prices, the group said.

But the new OfS report includes no details about the justification for pay rises.Instead, it concludes that “at least some” higher education providers are showing pay restraint.Matt Waddup, head of policy at the University and College Union, which represents university staff including academics, called the regulator’s report “lightweight”.He said: “The OfS has shown itself to be a paper tiger incapable of stopping the pay and perks scandals that have plagued universities.“The OfS fails to ask why some vice-chancellors are still picking up double-digit pay rises and doesn’t even look at their expenses or other benefits in kind. This report sends a message that those who accept such largesse have nothing to fear from the new regulator.”The report from the OfS reveals that some university vice-chancellors are being paid as much as 13 times the median pay of their staff.The University of Bath awarded the highest salary (£470,000) to its vice-chancellor and the University of Cambridge came second with a salary of £431,000 for its leader.\u0026nbspThird spot was taken by the University of Southampton, which paid a salary of £423,000 to Sir Christopher Snowden, despite thousands of students and academics calling for it to be cut.A total of 102 of 133 institutions analysed by the OfS increased their bosses’ salaries, figures show.The former De Montfort University leader received the largest pay rise. Dominic Shellard, who quit amid an investigation into regulatory matters, saw his salary increase by 22 per cent to £350,000.Angela Rayner, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: “The government’s own regulator now accepts that top pay at our universities continues to surge even while frontline staff face real terms pay cuts and student debt soars.”The report comes after Ms Rayner warned of “serious concerns” about the financial situation of the University of Reading during an urgent question in the Commons this week, adding that she had heard of at\u0026nbspleast three\u0026nbspuniversities facing insolvency.The University of Cardiff has announced plans to cut 380 posts over five years as part of moves to address a budget deficit of more than £20m.Damian Hinds, education secretary, said the government had given powers to the OfS to take action against universities that do not justify the pay and benefits of their vice-chancellors.The minister added that high pay should be justified by good results in areas like widening participation for disadvantaged groups, low dropout rates and innovative research.Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, said vice-chancellors should be prepared to answer “tough questions” when “pay is out of kilter”, or when salary increases outstrip pay awards to staff.But she added: “It is good to see signs of pay restraint at some universities, with some vice-chancellors refusing a salary increase.“A number of governing bodies have reduced the basic pay of their vice-chancellor, though we acknowledge that it can be difficult to revisit contractual obligations while a vice-chancellor is in post. We expect to see further progress next year.”A Universities UK spokesperson said: “Our universities are world-leading and are respected for excellence in teaching, innovation and research alike. It is important they can continue to attract the strongest talent to lead them, from within and outside the sector.”The spokesperson\u0026nbspadded that it was important for universities to show that the process for determining pay for senior staff was rigorous and that decisions had been “fair, explained and justified”.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Most of them are really useful, and it’s worth checking them out and enabling the ones you like by going to Settings and hitting the Labs tab. You can unsend sent messages with Gmail, and you don’t even need an add-on. Just go to Settings and check the Enable Undo Send option. You can choose between five, 10, 20 and 30 seconds as your cancellation period. After it’s over, there’s no getting that message back.The Starred messages feature is already really handy, but you can make it even better. In Settings, scroll down to the Stars section and choose which colour you want to use - you can switch the default golden one for orange, red, purple, blue or green.

No. But there\u0027s no denying DiCaprio\u0027s commitment to the cause: as Hugh Glass, the legendary explorer who was attacked by a bear and left for dead, he literally eats a raw bison liver.

That\u0027s unfair. James Cameron’s big-screen retelling of the ill-fated ship’s sinking – anchored by the love affair between Jack (DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) – is the perfect blockbuster and an all-round technical marvel.DiCaprio’s first Oscar nomination came with this slice-of-life drama following a young man (Johnny Depp) who cares for his mother and mentally impaired brother. Its themes of loneliness and desperation may not make Lasse Hallström’s film a heartwarming affair, but its breezy screenplay – brought to life by Depp and DiCaprio’s exceptional performances – makes it a compulsory one.It may lack the grit of Infernal Affairs, the Hong Kong film it’s based on, but The Departed is still a thrilling crime drama that fizzes with chutzpah from its opening scene. Its plot, following two moles – one within the Boston police force, the other as part of a fearsome mob boss’s crew – keeps viewers on their toes right through to its bullet-ridden final act.Save for its flabby climax, Quentin Tarantino’s revisionist take on the western genre is up there with his best.

The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)DiCaprio’s performance in The Wolf of Wall Street could well be the role of his career. As real-life stockbroker Jordan Belfort, he covers the whole gamut of emotions: charm (the workplace speeches), slapstick comedy (the quaalude stair-plummet) and horror (the domestic abuse). The Wolf of Wall Street slips alongside Mean Streets and Goodfellas as one of Martin Scorsese’s most re-watchable films. DiCaprio’s fourth film with Martin Scorsese is their only collaboration to be completely shunned by awards voters (it received a grand total of zero Oscar nominations). The mist-shrouded landscape of Shutter Island is a tribute to Sam Fuller’s 1963 cult film, Shock Corridor, and is a shining example of Scorsese succeeding in whatever he turns his hand to.Bouncy and gently amusing, Steven Spielberg\u0027s light drama stars DiCaprio as Frank Abergnale, a charming con artist whose life collides with that of FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). There’s  excitement to be had in Abergnale’s illicit escapades, as well as pathos when the circle eventually closes in. To call Inception a Leonardo DiCaprio film is to do a disservice to its writer-director Christopher Nolan, whose mind-bending blockbuster remains a staggering, if isive, achievement. DiCaprio could have easily rested on his laurels, knowing the audience would be dazzled by the director’s visuals, but his performance as Dom Cobb is genuinely affecting: his reaction to wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) throwing herself from a window is a devastating high point.Baz Luhrmann once described his update of Shakespeare\u0027s classic tragedy as funky.

Come at me, says David BarnettClick to followThe IndependentOasis’s London debut at the Water Rats, January 1994There will be those who have just read the headline and already gone directly to the comments to take issue. For any waverers, I’ll set out my stall again: 1994 was the best year in music. Possibly ever.\u0026nbspStill here? Right, we happy few, let’s unpack this a little. Putting the words “best” and “music” together is always going to be subjective. One woman’s Metallica is another man’s Joe Dolce. And there’s also time and place to take into account. If you were six years old in 1994, you might not have been bothered about contemporary pop. If you were 76, maybe ditto. But there are certain immutable, irrefutable truths, and this is one of them. The year 1994 was spectacular for music on so, so many levels.Perhaps a bit of wider context is needed. To live through 1994 as a relatively young person (I turned 24 in the January) was to be at the centre of what felt like a time of transcendent change in the UK.That was the year the IRA ceasefire was signed, and 911 was still seven years away, and not on on our radar at all. After the breakup of the Soviet Union three years earlier, Russia was more interested in implementing democracy and capitalism than fighting a Cold War. It felt like the dawn of an age – sadly short-lived – when nobody was trying to blow us up.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 1994, Bill Clinton was in the White House, and still a year away from staining his character (and a dress) by not having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. Neil Kinnock’s Labour had somehow lost the 1992 general election, despite everyone being confident the Tory stranglehold was finally over, but in 1994 Labour named Tony Blair as leader of the party, and things...\u0026nbspwell, things could only get better.To live through 1994 as a relatively young person ... was to be at the centre of what felt like a time of transcendent change in the UKAfter what seemed like years of stagnation, there was a whiff of change in the air. Things felt in some way more optimistic. The country felt more inclusive, less isive. There was opportunity, and expectation. It was the year they launched the National Lottery. Any one of us could become a multimillionaire by buying a ticket for a quid.And music reflected this, as it always reflects the world around it. There was a sensation of rapid, almost out-of-control evolution in music. People’s record collections became more eclectic, more wide-ranging, more small-c catholic. The old boundaries seemed to melt away. You didn’t need to choose between being a rocker or a raver or an indie-kid or a popster. You could be all of them at once, because if the bands and artists were refusing to stay in their pigeonholes, why should the public?Why we haven’t had a decent Christmas song since 1994Slap bang in the middle of the year, at the Glastonbury Festival at the end of June, I stood in a field and had a transformative experience watching the progressive techno band Orbital playing a set to what felt like half the people in the world. They had come to Glastonbury to see Oasis, or Rage Against the Machine they had come for Björk and James. They had come to listen to Nick Cave, to jump around to Blur, to dance to M People. And in the end, they all came to watch Orbital playing their bleepy, unnerving, bass-pounding music of the spheres, and for what felt like the first time ever the tribes were all united in the love of music.Of course, that could just be the drugs talking. But look at that Glastonbury line-up! Just one year, one scorching hot June weekend! And you can add to that list St Etienne, Paul Weller, Pulp, Spirtualised, Radiohead...\u0026nbsppossibly the best Glastonbury ever, in the year of the best music ever?That coming together at the Orbital set heralded a sea change for Glastonbury. According to Sheryl Garratt’s excellent book detailing the rise of rave culture, Adventures in Wonderland, Glasto organiser Michael Eavis had previously shied away from having a dance stage because of the negative connotations attached to rave and techno – primarily the drugs, illegal events and mass takeovers at places like Castlemorton two years previously.She wrote: “But after Orbital’s live set stole the show in 1994, a dance stage and dance tents were finally introduced the following year, and Glastonbury has become an annual event on the club calendar.”If I had to fight with myself over this bold claim for 1994 to be music’s finest year, I’d probably employ maybe 1988 as my weapon of choice. That was really the start of rave culture, and where dance music began to cross over with guitar bands, resulting in the baggy Madchester sound epitomised by the Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses, James and\u0026nbspthe Inspiral Carpets.But while that might have been where the seeds of fusion of the genres and inclusivity were sown, I’d argue that it wasn’t until 1994 that those ideas and concepts properly blossomed. And, of course, 1994 was the year of Britpop.It was actually in 1993 that Britpop got going, thanks to a feature in the now defunct music magazine Select. Grunge, with its poster boys Nirvana and their lead singer Kurt Cobain (more of whom anon) had held sway with its nihilistic, fuzzy guitars in Britain for a couple of years among an army of plaid-wearing, chain-smoking disaffected youth. But Select wanted to wave the flag for Blighty, quite literally as that month’s issue featured on its cover Suede’s Brett Anderson against a union jack background and an article\u0026nbspinside headlined, “Who Do You Think You Are Kidding, Mr Cobain?”. Denim, Pulp, Suede, The Auteurs and St Etienne were all featured, in a bid to push British pop back up the agenda.By 1994, two seminal Britpop albums went head to head – as did the bands responsible for them. Oasis released their debut Definitely Maybe, while Blur brought out their third LP, Parklife. Oasis v Blur bubbled under throughout the year, battle lines drawn at the Watford Gap. It was the naughty north vs the sexy south, Manchester’s Oasis and their Beatlesque anthems set against Blur’s cheeky chappy Camden Kinks roisterers. By the following year, the so-called rivalry even made the BBC evening news as the two bands released singles on the same day.If there ever was any proper animosity between Oasis and Blur, it didn’t extend to the fans. Blur or Oasis might have been a perennial pub debate throughout 1994, but I don’t think I knew anyone who didn’t own both Definitely Maybe and Parklife. The rivalry added a bit of spice, and music fans were the winners with two defining albums of the decade.Britpop wasn’t only about Blur and Oasis, of course, though as the cocky lads in the class they tended to get most of the attention. But let us consider some of the other releases that came under the red-white-and-blue Britpop banner:\u0026nbspPulp’s His ’n’\u0026nbspHers, considered to be the album that brought them to mainstream attention, especially for the standout tracks “Do You Remember the First Time?” and “Babies”\u0026nbspEchobelly’s debut Everyone’s Got One, with its spiky, caustic, feminist songs Suede’s second album Dog Man Star, which perhaps exemplified how bands were not afraid to evolve and transform in 1994. Suede’s first album was almost a paean to Bowie with a side order of The Smiths here they’d gone much more personal and perhaps introspective.Another band that completely reinvented itself in 1994 was Primal Scream. Never a band to stick with one musical style, they had, however, found a niche in the dance-rock mash-ups of 1991’s Screamadelica. When they returned in ’94 with Give Out But Don’t Give Up, it could not have been further from the blissed-out rhythms of “Loaded” and “Higher Than the Sun”. The Scream had gone full-on Rolling Stones blues, and the\u0026nbspfirst single from the album, “Rocks”, was the band’s highest-charting release.Had 1994 given us only Britpop, the year would still have deserved a place in posterity. But it was about so much more than that. Select magazine might have jokingly tried to drive America back into the sea the previous year, but US bands released some absolutely classic albums that year.What about Green Day’s Dookie, and its single “Basket Case”? By 1994, REM were stone-cold alt-rock royalty, and while their ninth studio album Monster might not be in everyone’s top five REM albums, it did at least give us the single “What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?”. Weezer released their self-titled debut, and Beck gave us the unalloyed eclectic joy of Mellow Gold and the single “Loser”.But the most influential American band of the era, Nirvana, came to a tragic end when, in April,\u0026nbspleader Kurt Cobain wrote a note to his imaginary childhood friend and then put a shotgun to his chin and pulled the trigger. He had gone and joined that stupid club, the one where the most talented musicians of a generation end their own lives at the age of 27. Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison. The year\u0026nbsphad its martyr.This was also the year that music fans who’d previously filled their CD racks with white boys playing guitars began to embrace rap and hip-hop\u0026nbsp– and also when hip-hop transformed, Kafka-like, into something quite new.Then Notorious BIG\u0026nbspreleased his debut Ready to Die, and indeed he did, becoming the martyr of 1997 a few years later. Public Enemy brought out their highly acclaimed fifth studio album, Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age, and the Beastie Boys fused hip hop with the greatest 1970s police detective show that never was with the video to their single “Sabotage”.In Britain, this acceptance of rap into the music collections of the largely white indie-kid audience led to the birth of something else we can thank 1994 for: trip-hop.The term was coined that year by a Mixmag journalist to describe the bass-heavy fusion of hip-hop and dance music that was largely coming out of Bristol. Massive Attack had already released the seminal Blue Lines album and the evergreen “Unfinished Sympathy” in 1991, but this year saw their second album Protection, and its standout single release “Karmacoma”. But the year was most notable for Portishead’s debut, Dummy, drenched in blue and heartbreak, and the soundtrack to a thousand all-back-to-mine post-club chillouts.What else? Well, we could still get away with forgiving Morrissey a lot back in 1994, especially with his fourth solo album Vauxhall and I. The Manic Street Preachers released The Holy Bible, the last work to feature troubled lyricist and guitarist Richey Edwards. The following year he would go missing, never to be found, making a martyr of a more introspective kind than Cobain’s dramatic exit. The old-stagers were keeping on keeping on, with albums from Madonna and the Rolling Stones, and even a wealth of previously unheard Beatles material from their sessions at the BBC.But if there was one comeback that exemplified 1994, it had to be The Stone Roses. Their self-titled debut album in 1989 soundtracked a generation. Their return five years later had a lot riding on it in terms of expectations. So, of course, they titled it The Second Coming.Bill Gates basically predicted rise of Netflix and Facebook in 1994Read this full unedited Tom Petty interview published in 1994Was it ever going to be as good as The Stone Roses? No, of course not, because that album was perfection. But with singles such as “Love Spreads” and “Ten Storey Love Song”, they made a pretty good fist of it. But it was an event, it was exciting, it was history-making. And it was brave and reckless and so typically Stone Roses\u0026nbspto release their first new album for years when everyone had all but written them off, and especially to do that in the greatest year for music ever.Without the benefit of the internet or smartphones, we discovered new music in 1994, we heard it in the pubs and at gigs and in clubs and festivals and on John Peel’s radio show. We bought indie music then we went to Creamfields or to superclubs in places like Leeds, and danced until dawn.Techno got hard and heavy. The aforementioned Orbital released Snivilisation, a growling, science-fiction nightmare of an album. The government tried to kill off rave culture good and proper with the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which drove people into the clubs but also earned a response from the Prodigy in the form of Music for the Jilted Generation, a howling, psychopathic protest album that gifted us the insane energy of “No Good (Start the Dance)” and “Voodoo People”. The Chemical Brothers, under the name the Dust Brothers, started releasing singles. Dance music became raw and scary, a self-fulfilling prophecy for those in positions of authority that thought they simply had to ban it.Music in 1994 was a erse mess, just like it always is. But it seemed as if there was an invisible thread running through all these genres\u0026nbspthat connected people through a general love of music. You might love Oasis more than the Prodigy, or Blur more than Portishead, but the chances are you listened to all of it. The year was about invention, about reinvention, about throwing open the doors and just trying everything. It was involving and inclusive and seems to shine so very brightly from the vantage point of today.\u0026nbspThe obvious answer to all this is that I am just old and clinging on to a year that seemed glorious just because I was there. But I insist: 1994 was the best year ever for music, and its spirit is something we could sorely do with today.

Adam Lusher meets themClick to followThe Independent‘Shiny ornaments in the town centre’: The EU-funded ‘Heart of the Furnace’ sculpture, with the signs for BrightHouse and Poundstretcher behindThis was the crucible that drove the industrial revolution, once.It was a valley blessed with mineral wealth in abundance, enough for men to dig out\u0026nbsp2\u0026nbspmillion tons of coal a year.The\u0026nbspsteelworks in Ebbw Vale could lay claim to being the biggest in Europe: 11,000 people working there in the 1960s, amid “the noise from the tinplate lines, the smell of acid used to clean steel coils, the sight of a hot ingot, as bright as the sun, being reduced to a thin steel slab”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAs one of its former MPs would recall, in Blaenau Gwent, in the south Wales valleys, the work was hard – and dangerous – but it built communities.Wales might not get as much money from Brexit as it did from the EUYet the steelworks have gone, demolished in 2002. The mines have shut.Marine was the last pit to go, closed in 1989.\u0026nbspIts only visible remains lie in a patch of wasteland beyond a dead-end road.\u0026nbspTwo large wheels rise above the ground.\u0026nbspOnce they were in constant motion, bringing up the coal and sending down the men to work in a pit that operated around the clock. The wheels have been sawn in half, encased in concrete, immobilised forever.\u0026nbspInstead of the sounds of work, there is silence.Where once Blaenau Gwent was full of the signs of heavy industry, now it is peppered with signs of a different kind: showing the stars of the\u0026nbspEU\u0026nbspflag, promising economic rebirth, offering uplifting slogans about “investing in your future”.And herein lies the paradox. Blaenau Gwent is in the heart of a region, the south Wales valleys, that has received\u0026nbspsome £4bn of EU funding over 20 years, and yet it is also the local council area that recorded Wales’s heaviest Leave vote, with 62 per cent backing Brexit in 2016.Reporters have visited from London, minds boggling at the place “showered with EU cash” that voted Leave, concluding – some of them – that the people here must be Brexit\u0026nbsp“turkeys who voted for Christmas”.They are not hard to find, these “turkeys”. You just back out of the dead-end road leading to the remains of Marine colliery and drive for a few minutes to the Legion pub in\u0026nbspCwm, where, for the benefit of the lunchtime drinkers, the widescreen TV is tuned to a radio station playing the hits of yesteryear.Dale Owen, 47, was a boy when the miners went on strike and the last pits closed under the government of Margaret Thatcher.\u0026nbspToo young to follow his father and grandfather down the pit, he became a painter and decorator.“I’m fed up and I voted out,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Year in, year out, we get poorer.\u0026nbspThey closed all the pits, closed the steelworks.\u0026nbspWhat are we left with?\u0026nbspA few food factories, and streets where shops are closing down left, right and centre.”“Where’s it all gone?” he asks, when you mention the EU money.\u0026nbsp“Regeneration projects?\u0026nbspWhere’s the regeneration? We’ve had 40-odd years of the EU.\u0026nbspI thought, f***\u0026nbspit, have a change.\u0026nbspIt can’t get any worse.”Mix in a few comments from others, about having to take rules from countries that have “forgotten who liberated them” during the war, and you have what could be portrayed as the vote of irrational rage, biting the EU hand trying to feed them.There’s just one big problem with such dismissiveness: even someone who played a big part in getting EU money to Blaenau Gwent sympathises with what Owen and others are saying.\u0026nbspIn the 1990s, Victoria Winckler was a leading member of the taskforce that secured €1.9bn\u0026nbsp(£1.6bn) of EU funding for west Wales and the valleys, granted for the years 2000-06 on the basis that this area was one of the most deprived in Europe.Now, as the director of the Bevan Foundation think tank, she has written that if the Welsh valleys were showered with cash, “it appears to have gone straight down the drain”.The woman who helped deliver the EU money says the Brexit-backers of Blaenau Gwent were not fools\u0026nbspthey were people who “voted for the better future that the EU had failed to deliver”.Confessing her own disillusion, Dr Winckler tells The Independent: “You can point to a number of shiny EU projects.\u0026nbsp You can say, ‘Oh look, you have got a dual carriageway, some nice sculptures in your town centre.’\u0026nbsp“But that has not made a material difference to people’s lives. They are still struggling to find work, struggling to make ends meet.”To call these people turkeys voting for Christmas, she says, is patronising: “It makes the assumption that EU funding is always good, and people who had it but still voted Leave must be stupid. It blames people who took a rational decision.”Winckler is backed by Professor Roger Awan-Scully of Cardiff University, who has extensively researched the Leave vote in the valleys.He thinks they took what, from their perspective, was a pretty rational decision: “People who felt they had nothing left to lose, rolled the die and tried change.”Or, as one senior Remain campaigner said in the bitter aftermath of defeat:\u0026nbspfor these people, fear of Brexit bringing economic disaster “wasn’t credible, because they felt their lives were already s***”.That, she says, just made it even more tempting to blame “that lot over there with their bent bananas”.“The EU,” says Winckler, “has been wrongly blamed for all the ills that have affected Blaenau Gwent and other areas like it. There was a failure of UK government policy, from all parties, a long-term restructuring of the UK economy in which, to generalise very crudely, the regions were left to wither and die, while London and the south prospered.\u0026nbspOn top of which came a thick layer of austerity”.But both Awan-Scully and Winckler are pretty scathing about the Remain campaign as fought in 2016.Perhaps, then, if a Final Say referendum ever materialises from the current chaos – and perhaps even if it doesn’t – some lessons should be learned from what are called, with maybe a whiff of condescension, “the left-behind communities”.At HQ level there might also have to be an understanding of what happened when, as one campaigner put it, “Remain was fought in the spirit of a gentleman’s cricket match against a bunch of lunatics on day release from a life sentence of being themselves.”But as well as pointing to micro-targeted social media ads\u0026nbspand broken Brexit campaign spending limits, Remainers might want to look at how to fight a better ‘ground war’ – one that doesn’t complacently dismiss Leave voters in places like Blaenau Gwent fools.It is true that in Blaenau Gwent you can, if you look hard enough, find Brexit voters expressing, if not full-on “bregret”, then at least ambivalence over how they were sold what Winckler calls the Leave campaign’s “very simple and attractive promises”.But it does seem that for every Andrew, you can find a Steven Roberts, 57, of the Cwmglo Jewellery and Fashion shop, cafe\u0026nbspand art gallery.“I voted Remain,” he says, “But if I had to choose now, I would probably vote Leave. Over the past 30 to 40 years, Blaenau Gwent and the south Wales valleys have been absolutely devastated – raped and left to rot.“The people here have been shafted for so long.\u0026nbspIf we leave, we can’t do any worse than we are doing at the moment. We are not turkeys. We are desperate people. Very desperate.”Everyone here knows about the EU funding. Everyone derides it. The ungrateful natives even have the temerity to mock the shiny new roads that were built for them.The Heads of the Valley dual carriageway, upgraded with £79m of EU money, is dismissed as “the Blaenau Gwent bypass, the fast road out to the Midlands”, useless for low-wage workers trying to get to work when bus services are “always being cut”.“They’ve showered us with cash and it’s gone on the wrong things,” says a woman at\u0026nbspthe food bank, in Beaufort, a village above Ebbw Vale.Created with Sketch.

Now with her chemotherapy finished, Sarah faces reconstructive surgery and a massive drop in her employment support allowance. Hence the food bank trip.“There’s nothing left for people in Ebbw Vale,” she says. “No future for my children, no secure jobs, just zero-hours contracts.\u0026nbspMy 19-year-old hasn’t had a full-time, settled job since he left school. He’s suffering with depression.”All the signs are that mental illness is on the rise in Blaenau Gwent, while average male wages have stagnated since the steelworks shut. By the time of the referendum, a man on median wages was £71 a week worse off in real terms than in the early 2000s.People with jobs sometimes have to resort to the food bank. Some families need charitable assistance before they can send their children to school in proper shoes and uniforms.And, according to Sarah, to a community at “rock bottom”, in urgent need of economic resuscitation, the EU money has bought “shiny ornaments in the town centre”.Everyone tells you about the shiny dragon in Ebbw Vale town centre. It is reached by walking up the main street, past signs of rampant fuel poverty blighting an area once famous for coal production: “Pay gas and electric here” says the note in the window of Cash \u0026amp Xchange.\u0026nbsp“Sell your stuff, buy it back later, for cash when you need it,” promises Cash Generator.And then, after just two vape shops, the dragon is there: rising 13ft\u0026nbsphigh on its hind legs, a glittering vision of resurgent power fired by the past glories referenced in the artwork’s title:\u0026nbspHeart of the Furnace.“Yet another positive example of how Welsh government and EU funds are benefiting the region,” was the verdict of Jane Hutt, the Welsh government finance minister who unveiled it in 2014.If you look at the background, you can see that the dragon is flanked on one side by a sign for BrightHouse\u0026nbspand on the other by a banner for Poundstretcher, neither suggestive of an economy roaring back to greatness.Of course, some of the results of local council, Welsh government and EU regeneration funding are, as Winckler and others point out, invisible to the naked eye.Considerable amounts of money have, for example, been spent on apprenticeships. In other words, you can choose how to interpret the banner outside the new Ebbw Vale Sports Centre, built on part of the old steelworks site.\u0026nbspThe banner advertises “Bridges Into Work 2”, free training for the over-25s and unemployed, thanks to money from the European Social Fund.Perhaps this shows the EU properly addressing Blaenau Gwent’s underlying problems. But it could also be read as a confession that a shiny new sports centre cannot replace the jobs lost when the steelworks shut – even if the new building gets listed on the internet as “a modern leisure hub with a pool and water slides”.There is a similar ambivalence about the £21m Ebbw Fawr Learning Community, the new “super-school” that also occupies part of the old steelworks site.In the Cwm Legion, Owen talks proudly of “going skint to put my daughter in university”. But then he adds: “I told her to get out of this area. I don’t want her struggling like I did. There is no future for kids here. They turn to drink or drugs.”He is not the only one asking what lies in store for their children once they leave their shiny new super-school. They all know this isn’t just the EU’s fault. Many are more angry at local politicians, for a perceived lack of strategic vision in spending the money, than they are about the EU that granted the funds.In the former constituency of Aneurin Bevan, the people of Blaenau Gwent dismiss nearly all modern politicians as hopelessly out of touch with the struggles of their community.“They might as well live on the moon as far as I am concerned,” says Sarah in the food bank.She talks of backing Brexit as “a rebellion. We had just had enough. The system had to change.”You do worry, though, about how, post-Brexit, “the system”\u0026nbspmight change for the even worse. How would money be found to help places like Blaenau Gwent if “rolling the die”\u0026nbspand voting Leave pushed the entire British economy into a no-deal, cliff-edge Brexit? Who in a post-Brexit UK would be strong enough to defend some of the values that are central to EU membership?\u0026nbspRather pointedly, Winckler stresses “the EU’s fairness role, which means one country can’t undercut another in terms of how it treats its workers”.The people of Blaenau Gwent are smart enough to see through the likes of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, men not exactly known for their instinctive understanding of, or sympathy for, the struggling ex-miner or former steelworker.History valley- where the revival was bornNissan has been betrayed by Brexit ideologues like Jacob Rees-MoggBut, given the hand dealt them by many conventional politicians over many decades, you can’t be entirely surprised by the response when you ask about the risks of being delivered into the clutches of Brexiteers who arguably couldn’t care less about them.“Nobody else cares about us either,” says Roberts.If you are a Remainer hoping to win a second referendum, you might have to consider whether he has a point.If you are seeking “turkeys”, you might like to wonder whether, come Brexit, no Brexit or Theresa May compromise, a community that helped make Britain “great” deserves much better – from its own government as much as the EU – than more of the same\u0026nbspand a shiny dragon.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”.

Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHRapper Cupcakke, from Chicago, is also set to perform that day.Other acts on the programme\u0026nbspinclude Brockhampton, Charlotte de Witte, Loyle Carner, Green Velvet, Patrick Topping, Guy Gerber, and Vanjess.This year, the Lovebox festival will be held at Gunnersbury Park in West London for the second time, having moved from Victoria Park.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That could be bad news for users.Everything we know about Apple\u0027s next iPhoneIt means that Apple won\u0027t be shipping the more powerful plugs that it includes with its latest iPads, and which can be bought for extra money. Those bigger plugs charge the phones and other products more quickly, allowing people not to have to wait while they charge up.The latest iPhones have the ability to use fast charging, but they require a plug that allows them to work. The 5W charger bundled in the box does of course charge the phone, but at a much slower rate, and iPhone users have to pay up for the more powerful plug.The problem is becoming clearer as Apple\u0027s batteries get larger, as has happened in recent phones. Though that means that phones can hold much more charge, it also takes them much longer to fill up.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.2143 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2743 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3043 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3143 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3243 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3343 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3443 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3543 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3643 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3743 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3843 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3943 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4043 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4143 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4243 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped.

Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4343 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. It did not consider the illustrations, which were designed to depict a helmet and a safe, to be cartoon-like or appealing to children. The use of graffiti was also intended to target adult consumer groups who were urban, creative and expressive, it claimed.\u0026nbspThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received four complaints that the advertisements suggested that smoking was safe and were likely to appeal to and encouraged those under the age of 18 to start smoking.They said many people would interpret the use of the word safe to suggest that smoking with Rizla rolling papers was safe, rather than solely as a reference to the packaging of the new product.The watchdog found that the use of graffiti in both ads, and the term safe, which was also a slang term commonly used by young people, was associated with youth culture and would resonate with and appeal to people under 18.Because the use of the word \u0027safe\u0027 suggested that smoking was safe, and this could encourage people to smoke or increase their consumption, we concluded the ad breached the code,” the ASA said.\u0026nbspWe also considered that the presentation of two people standing in bold coloured cardboard cut-out objects which also corresponded to the colour of the Rizla packaging ... were shown in a playful manner and which was likely to appeal to people under 18.The ASA ruled that the two poster ads must not appear again in their current form.\u0026nbspA third advert, which was posted on Rizla UK\u0027s Facebook page asking people to like and share it, was not banned.A spokesman for Imperial Tobacco said: We take our obligations regarding UK advertising laws and the responsible marketing of our products extremely seriously.\u0026nbspWe have co-operated fully with the ASA in support of their inquiries.The intention of the advertisement campaign, which is no longer current, was to inform existing adult Rizla users about improvements made to Rizla packaging.\u0026nbspNevertheless, we respect the ASA\u0027s ruling and take careful note of their assessment.Additional reporting from Press AssociationWe’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

He\u0026nbspsought asylum when a warrant was issued for his arrest in Zimbabwe after he wrote blog posts hostile to the government.Zimbabwe officials interrogate asylum seekers in UK detention centresMr Mujakachi, 58, said\u0026nbspthat in his re-documentation interview in December,\u0026nbspembassy officials had asked for more information about him and his relatives in a bid to confirm his\u0026nbspidentity – which he found “highly suspicious”. He added that he “would not be spared” by the Zimbabwean authorities.Speaking from Vulcan House on Monday, he\u0026nbspsaid: “I’m shocked that they want to send me back to a place where all those terrible things are happening. I’ve been vocal about the atrocities through my Twitter feeds and on YouTube. I will definitely stand out.“I won’t be able to walk out of the airport terminal without being interrogated by the police. There will be brutal beatings.“There was recently a debate in the House of Commons condemning the brutality and heavy-handedness of the Zimbabwean army and the police. They’ve condemned it. Do they think a mere condemnation by words is going to stop what’s happening?“Every government has a right to control immigration within its borders, but with this government it’s ideologically driven. They look at soft targets, and I am a soft target.”Zimbabwe officials interrogate asylum seekers in UK detention centresHome Office admits just one person helped by Windrush hardship schemeHome Office should no longer have power to detain people, MPs sayMr Mujakachi’s son, Simba, who was also ordered to sign on with the Home Office on Monday, but was not detained like his father, said he believed that if his father was removed to Zimbabwe, he would be “killed straight away”.“I don’t know how they can pull a move like this, working with the Zimbabwean government. It doesn’t make sense with what’s going on in Zimbabwe. It’s cruelty,” he said.“I think he’s going to get killed straight away. They will take him from the airport straight away and we will never hear about him again. We know how this government runs. A lot of people have been taken recently and no one knows where they are.“I haven’t eaten since I went and my dad got taken. I’ve been struggling to eat. I’m worried about my dad. I’m worried about me. I don’t know why I was let out yesterday, but I’m sure that sooner or later they will take me.”Mr Mujakachi’s solicitor, Kathryn Hodder, who is seeking to submit an injunction to prevent his removal, said she believed the alleged agreement between\u0026nbspthe Home Office and Zimbabwean officials could be acting in breach of UK\u0026nbspimmigration rules, which prohibit “actors of persecution” being directly informed that an application for asylum has been made.She added: “Before, they couldn’t remove Zimbabweans because there was no agreement with the government. So no one from Zimbabwe could be removed unless they got a passport.Violence in Zimbabwe obscures the potential for a bright future“But it looks like this government wants aid from the UK, so it’s just part of politics – we’ll give you money if you take back your people.“Victor didn’t have a passport, and now he’s got travel documents from the Zimbabwean government. The embassy representative had a big file and said he knew everything about him. It’s not good if they government knows about him even before he’s removed.”Sheffield councillor Jackie Drayton, who accompanied Mr Mujakachi to sign on at Vulcan House, where he was detained, said it was “awful” that he was facing removal, saying: “He didn’t come prepared to not go home. It’s so sudden and shocking.“Victor is somebody who has been threatened by the government. And he’s very active about the things going on at the moment. Yes, Mugabe is not in power now, but there’s no doubt people in his government are still I power, and it’s not a safe place for people.”Marian Machekanyanga, another Zimbabwean national who was also forced to attend a re-documentation interview in December, and has been ordered to sign on next week,\u0026nbspsaid she was “terrified” that she would have the same fate as Mr Mujakachi.The 54-year-old, who has been in the UK for 16 years after fleeing political persecution for her opposition to the government, said: “I was in tears when I received the letter. I’m very scared. I know that they are going to take me. People are being killed by the regime. I’m even more scared than last time.”It was widely reported by the Zimbabwean media in February that the then British ambassador to Zimbabwe, Catriona Laing, had told Kembo Mohadi, Zimbabwe’s deputy president, that the UK intended to deport illegal Zimbabweans to the country.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 48Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Young members of Britain\u0027s opposition Labour party write on a billboard why they want Jeremy Corbyn the party leader to back a People\u0027s Vote second referendum on Britain\u0027s European Union membership, during a publicity stunt in Islington North, Corbyn\u0027s north London constituency.

It is unclear how Seaborne, a company with no assets and whose only known contract has now been cancelled, could shoulder any dredging costs which local campaigners calculate to be at least £400,000 and which could spiral to several million.Mr\u0026nbspMessenger said there is a likelihood that costs will balloon and work could take several months if more comprehensive dredging is required, while North Thanet MP Sir Roger Gale has said he believes the operation could cost up to £4m.Despite pledging to “not spend a penny” of taxpayers’ money on the Seaborne contract, Mr Grayling did not rule out a government takeover of Ramsgate port when questioned on Monday.Asked by Sir Roger Gale if there was anything preventing the DfT stepping in, the transport minister told the Commons he had been “very clear that we have to be mindful of the financial position of Thanet council and we must make sure that they are not exposed to the broader financial risk of the broader resilience work being done right across Kent”.According to the NAO, Mr Grayling’s department only realised in September that extra freight capacity would be needed to prevent significant no-deal Brexit disruption at crucial Channel ports supplying more than a fifth of the UK’s goods.The DfT decided not to go through the normal open tender process, believing that this could notify the market and push up prices for additional freight. Instead, nine ferry operators were contacted privately and asked to bid.Only three did so: DFDS, Britanny and Seaborne. All three were awarded contracts in December, with the public notices quietly published on Christmas Eve. Lack of interest meant the government received offers for less than half of the capacity it had hoped and could supply a maximum of 11 per cent of the freight currently going through the short Channel routes.The DfT went ahead with the deals despite finding that Seaborne was “non-compliant with the requirements set out in the invitation to tender”.“As a new business without significant financial history, Seaborne were unable to satisfactorily meet the requirements of the economic and financial standing assessment,” the NAO said.“The department, considering the information it held on the bidders and the due diligence it had undertaken, decided to award contracts to all three bidders.”Oord was dredging in Ramsgate port on Tuesday despite the fact that the Seaborne contract has been cancelled (MarineTraffic)Mr Grayling’s department ignored numerous warnings from highly paid consultants about the Seaborne contract, the NAO said. After spending £800,000 on consultancy fees the DfT assessed the contract as being a “high-risk proposition” late last year but went ahead with it in any case. Despite the alarm bells Mr Grayling insisted publicly in January that the contract was “not a risk”.In November, DfT advisor Deloitte said that it could not assess Seaborne’s financial stability because the company had only been registered in July 2017. Mr Grayling’s department last week earmarked a further £800,000 to pay legal fees relating to Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel which is suing the DfT for its “secretive and flawed procurement process”.The DfT’s accounting officer reviewed the Seaborne decision, which found that failure to act would mean losing “the ability to secure ferry capacity that could protect critical goods under a no-deal exit” and that “reasonable measures” had been taken to ensure value for money. The Treasury then approved the deal. Among risks identified were “teething troubles” due to Seaborne’s inexperience, the fact that the company had no contracts to use either Ramsgate or Ostend ports and had no ships chartered. The DfT also raised concerns about the work needed to get Ramsgate ready for use and a recruitment process for Border Force officers. Former Thanet District Councillor Ian Driver told The Independent this week that the site remained “like a bombsite”.Mr Messenger of the county council said it was regrettable that Ramsgate and its 40,000 residents were being “used as pawns” in a battle between Leave and Remain factions.The councillor is backing alternative proposals to transform Ramsgate into a marina focused on leisure and tourism rather than freight. The proposals are commercially viable, unlike the freight option, and will mean less pollution and disruption for local residents, Mr Messenger said.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Brussels\u0026nbsphas insisted that\u0026nbspit will not reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspmeaning no changes to the controversial Irish\u0026nbspbackstop.On Tuesday, Ms May will have to ask MPs for more time to secure the changes she is seeking.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe\u0026nbspfurther delay has renewed speculation that this is a deliberate ploy, with Labour accusing the prime minister of “cynically” running down the clock.Some opponents claim that her strategy is to waste time and then\u0026nbspforce MPs to vote on her deal when it is too late to find any alternative.Move your Brexit red lines, Labour and EU both tell Theresa MayIn theory she could return to the Commons late in March –\u0026nbspjust days before the 29 March exit date –\u0026nbspand claim parliament has only two choices: back her deal\u0026nbspor leave the EU without an agreement.\u0026nbspMs May\u0026nbsphas already pushed back key votes on her Brexit deal, fuelling claims\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspshe is playing for time.First she delayed the “meaningful vote” on her\u0026nbspwithdrawal agreement\u0026nbspby more than\u0026nbspa month. Originally due to take place on 11 December, it was eventually held on 15 January.When the deal was rejected by an unprecedented\u0026nbsp230 votes, many people expected the prime minister to change strategy and pivot towards a softer Brexit, a no-deal outcome or some form of public vote.That has not happened. Instead, she\u0026nbsphas insisted she can secure the concessions from the EU that she believes she needs\u0026nbspto win parliament’s support for her deal, despite Brussels giving no indication\u0026nbspthat it is willing to budge.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentMore delays seem to be on the horizon. Last month, Ms May promised that she would either give MPs a vote on a revised deal\u0026nbspby 13 February or, if she had not been able to secure further changes, on an amendable motion updating the Commons on her negotiations.With no alternative deal\u0026nbspin sight, MPs will only\u0026nbspvote this week on the government’s update,\u0026nbspwhich is likely to say that more time is needed\u0026nbspto secure changes to the agreement.Ministers have floated\u0026nbspthe prospect of a similar vote being held on 27\u0026nbspFebruary, meaning a second vote on the deal itself\u0026nbspis unlikely to happen before the end of February at the earliest. Even if a deal is then approved, it would leave just a month for parliament to pass all the legislation needed to enact Brexit.Video shows Jeremy Corbyn vowing to ‘defeat’ the EUFood industry threatens to end cooperation over no-deal riskCorbyn ‘cut second referendum line from letter to May’‘Take a breath’ and admit UK not ready for Brexit, Tory MPs tell MayAn EU summit scheduled for 22 March –\u0026nbspless than a week before Brexit day –\u0026nbspcould give Ms May justification for further delays, if she argues that this is when the EU will finally offer new concessions.\u0026nbspEven if no concessions were forthcoming, some people\u0026nbspbelieve that, faced with the threat of a no-deal Brexit in a matter of days, MPs would reluctantly\u0026nbspagree to support the prime minister’s plan (even if it is fundamentally unchanged from the one rejected in January).\u0026nbspBut any strategy involving running down the clock is highly risky, not least because it\u0026nbsprelies on parliament agreeing not to intervene in the coming weeks. Last month, Labour’s Yvette Cooper tabled an amendment that would have delayed Brexit until the end of the year if no deal was in place by the end of February.That motion was rejected by a margin of 23 votes, but as Brexit edges closer and the prospect of no deal becomes ever more likely, MPs might be swayed into backing another, similar\u0026nbspamendment.\u0026nbspThe Labour leadership is also seeking to torpedo Ms May’s ability to waste time. Jeremy Corbyn has written to the prime minister offering talks on a cross-party compromise deal, and will this week table an amendment that would force her to hold a second vote on her Brexit deal –\u0026nbsprevised or not –\u0026nbspby 26 February.No one other than Ms May and her closest advisers knows whether\u0026nbspshe is deliberately running down the clock.\u0026nbspBut the continual delays and her refusal to consider an extension to Article 50 do little to quash claims that this is her plan.Even if it is\u0026nbspnot, the fact remains that the 29 March Brexit date is enshrined in law and the UK is speeding towards it without a deal in sight. Whether or not it is deliberately\u0026nbspbeing run down,\u0026nbspthe clock is\u0026nbspticking ever louder.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

The farce deepened when it was found that the company appeared to have copied the terms and conditions on its website from a takeaway restaurant.Mr Grayling was forced to scrap the deal last week after Seaborne\u0027s apparent main\u0026nbspbacker, Irish firm Arklow Shipping, withdrew its support.Defending the decision in the Commons on Monday, the transport secretary\u0026nbsptold MPs: We have spent no money on this contract.He had previously insisted that no money would be spent unless the ferries\u0026nbspbegan operating,However, a memo produced by the National Audit Office (NAO) found that the Department for Transport had paid £800,000 to consultants Slaughter and May, Deloitte and Mott MacDonald to scrutinise the three ferry deals.Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald raised the issue in a Commons\u0026nbsppoint of order\u0026nbspon Tuesday and\u0026nbspsuggested\u0026nbspMr Grayling had breached the ministerial code by misleading MPs.In a follow-up letter to Ms May, he said the transport secretary had repeatedly defended the decision to award the contract by claiming there would be no cost to the taxpayer as the company would not receive payment were they unable to provide services.He wrote: In answer to my Urgent Question on 8\u0026nbspJanuary, the secretary of state claimed, \u0027We are not spending money unless these ferries operate\u0027.\u0026nbspThis is plainly untrue as there are several costs associated with the awarding of this contract. Yesterday, the National Audit Office found that £800,000 had been spent on external consultants to assess the bid.The secretary of state for transport has misled parliament. At this stage in Brexit preparations and regarding an issue of such national significance, the transport secretary’s misleading of parliament damages our country’s reputation and corrodes trust in politics.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

There’s so much he’s got to give! He’s completely positive!In footage from , the then anonymous backbench MP from the People’s Republic of Islington ­lambasts “the European empire” and mocks Brussels for wanting referendums re-run until they produce the “correct” result.Oh, Jeremy Corbyn!I bet all the middle-class kiddies who worshipped at your sandals-and-socks combo at Glastonbury never saw this coming.The footage of Corbyn dissing Brussels to an Irish audience is so incendiary it makes Liam Neeson look as though he chooses his words carefully.Comrade Corbyn really, really could not be clearer about his true feelings.“We are creating here one massive great Frankenstein which will damage all of us in the long run,” he says of the EU.“If you succeed in getting a No vote herethat will be such a boost to people like us, all over Europe, who do not want to live in a European empire of the st century.”You tell ’em, Boris! I mean, Jeremy!After being forced out of the Brexit closet, JC can no longer cynically have it both ways — playing a Remainer to the middle class and a Leaver to the working class. That hypocritical ploy to squeeze into  Downing Street will no longer fly.It is a dead ploy. That ploy is extinct. It is no more.On the great issue of our time, the old boy just got shoved right off the fence. And fell on his face.Donald Tusk, Brussels’ head bully boy, digressed from condemning .million Brits to hell for voting Leave to sneer that there is a “leadership void” in the Remain camp. He means YOU, Jeremy.Tusk has seen right through two-faced Corbyn, evenall the little Marxist morons who chant his name are only just waking up to the cruel truth. Corbyn deserves to be despised by both sides of the debate.He placed the prospect of power above his principles. And we still don’t really know how he voted in the Referendum — although we can make an educated guess.The irony is that Jeremy Corbyn could have been a true hero to the working-class men and women who have voted Labour for a letime and then voted in their millions to leave the EU.Corbyn could have spoken for those men and women and stood up for them when the sneering elite dismissed them as thick, racist bigots too stupid to have a valid opinion.It was Tony Benn, Corbyn’s great hero, and the most eloquent opponent of the European Union in our nation’s history, who famously said he felt like “a slave to Rome” when he went to Brussels.Tony Benn would have had the courage to advocate Brexit and ­Corbyn must know it.Jeremy will be a tiny footnote in our nation’s history but what a crying shame that, in our country’s time of need, the Labour Party could not produce a leader who would represent the millions of working-class men and women who have learned to despise the EU.Corbyn tried to play it smart — and still does — by endlessly parroting that “everything is on the table” and never truly engaging with the debate that has come close to tearing this country apart.And now he has been caught out because Corbyn, always more Mickey Mouse than Machiavelli, was never clever enough to play this duplicitous game.The EU is revealing its true nature — a bullying empire that has no interest in being a partner, friend or ally of the Britishwe eventually manage to leave.The EU wants to see us on our knees.The EU wants to see us suffer for refusing to be their obedient colony.The EU wants us to pay such a high price for leaving that the remaining countries will be too timid to dream of le beyond this democracy-despising empire.All we can do is oppose these arrogant, unelected bullies. All we can do is demand our independence — no matter the dark warnings, no matter the sneering, no matter the threat of punishment beatings.What a tragedy for Labour that their leader never had the guts to join this nation’s fight for independence.ELLE MACPHERSON has revealed her simple guide for looking drop dead gorgeous.Most of Elle’s tips are eminently doable for any of us – eat your evening meal early , get fresh air every day, have some calming tea before bedtime and,sleep doesn’t come, put your feet up for five minutes.Only one of The Body’s tips is more dficult to arrange – Elle suggests regular relaxation in a sauna or steam room – but most of her guidelines for healthy radiance are simple common sense.But she has missed the most important tip of all.Be born beautul.Don’t forget that one, Elle!THE Tories are very keen on “autonomous” vehicles – driverless cars with no steering wheels and “no human oversight” – and hope that they will be zipping about on our roads within two years.Automotive minister Richard Harrington says: “We need to ensure we take the public with us as we move towards having self-driving cars on our roads by .”But I remember when a Labour government swore to us that diesel cars were the bright, shining future.In , Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced tax changes to petrol-fuelled cars that led to a massive increase in idiots like me buying diesel cars.The thinking was that diesel would help the environment because diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide than petrol engines.Unfortunately, diesel also produces far more pollutants and poisons, resulting in around , deaths every year.Whoops.I now have an elderly diesel car sitting on the drive that everyone hates.My excuse is that Gordon Brown told me I was saving the planet.Nobody wants diesel today. That is why Japanese car- maker Nissan will not be building its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. Brexit doesn’t come into it.These days driving a diesel is considered to be slightly less healthy than smoking crack. And the Tory “dash to driverless” is as muddle-headed as the Labour “dash to diesel” when Gordon Brown was in his pomp.Driverless cars – what could possibly go wrong WHEN Prince Charles met the Spice Girls in , the Prince of Wales clearly towered above the then Geri Halliwell.Reunited this week, they now appear to be the same height.Has the former Ginger Spice grown over the last  years Or is our future king shrinking  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it strikes a powerful chord with real people, particularly voters in the North.They resent claims they are racist thickos and believe all parties lied to them in  when they promised to deliver on the referendum, whatever the outcome.Like the BBC — and, indeed, the EU itself — Remainers are slow to realise time is running out. Brexit is to the EU what Netflix is to the BBC. The £billion licence fee — like the European “Grand Project” — is on its way out.Whatever last-minute deal Theresa May brings home, the scepticism which brought Brexit to le cannot simply be turned off.It is a disruptive force and is already beginning to sweep away the EU as we know it.Economist Bernard Connolly famously identied this as the logical consequence of EU skulduggery in his book The Rotten Heart Of Europe: The Dirty War For Europe’s Money.Connolly was in charge of setting up the euro, the slow-burning catastrophe which has wrecked economies and young lives across the EU.He was sacked for exposing the secretive abuse of power at the very top, exposing the unscrupulous methods deployed by an unaccountable regime to bludgeon critics into submission.The same tactics are used on rebellious nations like Britain today and Greece in , triggering the explosion of anger we are seeing among protesting citizens and a rise of authoritarianism against such dissent.EU states are at each other’s throats — Italy against France, Brussels against Hungary and Poland.The rise of military-style policing — French police firing hard rubber bullets at unarmed yellow-jacket protestors, the jailing of dissident politicians in Catalonia — is alarming.Romania, a former Soviet police state, is reverting to type and spying on its own citizens.Hungary locks up opponents and silences the media.The EU does nothing, fearing for its own survival.Europe-wide polls reveal increasing antagonism to Brussels, deeper even than here in the UK.He remains a cherished champion of free speech and razor-sharp inquisitorial combat.Mean-spirited as ever, the left-wingcould not resist suggesting he was past his sell-by date.Not by such a margin as this preachy, unpopular rag which is about to go out of print.Those politicians who believe we mustto the EU’s totalitarian embrace are grievously out of step.Yes, Brexit has been botched, both by Theresa May and by Brexiteers themselves. There may be trouble ahead.But those who voted in their millions in  to leave have not budged. If anything, their mood has hardened.In a second referendum, a straight choice between Leave and Remain would turn Brexit into a landslide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their foolishness means Britain must give away a fixed . per cent of national income at a time when global poverty is plummeting due to capitalism, scientic progress and technological advances.Now some Tories are trying to find ways to keep their promise to hit this aid target, while spending the money in fresh ways. That exposes the ­shallowness of ministers’ ­posturing as heroic saviours of the poor and dispossessed.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told the Cabinet last month this level of aid spending was “unsustainable” and money should be shted to domestic priorities.She has floated the idea of ­building new ships for the Royal Navy from the aid ­budget by using them for humanitarian operations.And she knows the issue will rear up in any forthcoming Tory leadership battle.Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson chipped in, saying Britain needs more control over what counts as foreign aid under international rules — and that it should go towards boosting British foreign policy objectives.His move was linked to a report by former soldier turned Tory MP Bob Seely arguing that Britain should simply define its own aid spending to include our ­“strategic goals”.Yet they all miss the obvious solution. Just DITCH the target and abandon the  law binding us to it — one that makes the Department for International Developmentthe only ministry that must explain itself to MPsit fails to spend enough.This silly UN target is an historic anachronism devised by campaigners half a century ago based on flawed, outdated economic data.It makes no sense to rely on a fixed spending target based on national income over needs in poor places — as predicted by a former Tory Chancellor, respected Labour peers and a British economist who won the Nobel Prize for their expertise in poverty.One horried DfID minister confessed to me he thought spending was at least TRIPLE what it should be — yet whenever he tried to thwart wasteful projects, they simply bounced back from officials on to his desk again.It was no surprise to find those pen-pushers in the poverty relief department are among the best-paid bureaucrats in Whitehall.This torrent of cash has fuelled a self-serving aid industry stuffed with fat cats on six-figure salaries in charities and private firms.These people are so focused on protecting their valuable brands that some of the best-known organisations covered up abuse, rape, malpractice and theft.Their political paymasters pose as municent saviours of the world. Yet as I have seen on three continents, much of the money taken from taxpayers is blown on ludicrous projects based on bogus statistics — and ends up doing more harm than good by fostering conflict and undermining democracy.I was in Ghana last year, investigating a UK-funded scheme to pour cash into a few villages to prove aid works.“Far from breaking the poverty trap, the project does not appear to have reduced poverty or hunger at all,” concluded DfID’s own report.Yet we give cash to fast-emerging powerhouses such as China and India.We give cash to countries riddled with corruption, such as Uganda, where I found officials inflating the number of refugees to grab more funds from foreign donors.We give cash to places that have space programmes, even their own aid agencies.And we pour cash into countries run by gangsters spending huge sums on weapons — and in Rwanda’s case, on the brutal president’s favourite Premier League football club, Arsenal.Even North Korea, which runs massive death camps under a bloodstained family dictatorship, has been a beneficiary of UK aid. This is what happens when politicians prioritise spin and spending over needs and reality.Holland has showed a country can get off this hook. It abandoned the target and found the anticipated fuss died down quickly.The sht led to renewed focus on efficient spending, with fewer countries receiving donations. “We were surprised it was so easily dealt with,” one insider told me.Dutch spending has dipped from . per cent of national income in  to . per cent last year and will fall again over the coming years.Let us welcome the dawning realisation in Westminster that fixating on an aid target has been a dire failure.Instead of tinkering with definitions — or deceiving voters by slipping domestic spending under the foreign aid banner — politicians should accept their mistake and abandon that daft targetOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I cant tell you how frustrating it is to see that.Clooneys comments came as Meghan was locked in a fierce war of words with her family after a bombshell letter to her dad was leaked to a newspaper last weekend.But hours later Piers Morgan hit back at Clooneys claims in his column for the MailOnline.He wrote: He [Clooney] is wrong to blame the media for negative headlines driven largely by Meghan’s own family.The tabloid veteran added: The problem is Meghan’s incredibly toxic relationship with her family that shows no sign of abating and in fact, gets worse by the day.The problem here isn’t the media, which has largely given Meghan a very positive ride.Morgan, who has spoken in the past about supposedly being ghosted by Markle, says the Duchess knew exactly what she was doing when she married Harry and milked the global fame... with obvious glee - unlike the naive -year-old Diana.The -year-old broadcaster urges Meghan to reunite with her ailing and flailing father, saying: No wonder then that her family feel less than enamoured towards the newly ennobled Duchess: she’s dumped them all like a sack of rancid potatoes, lest they poison her perfect new privileged royal well.The spat came after a five-page letter from Meghan to her dad Thomas was leaked to the press, revealing how his actions have broken [her] heart into a million pieces.In it, Meghan slammed her dad for his wayward behaviour and for creating so much pain, as well as exploiting her relationship with Harry.Meghans family has been an ongoing source of concern for Kensington Palace over the past year.Thomas Markle Snr, , is still yet to meet Prince Harry after withdrawing from the Royal Wedding for health reasons just days before he was supposed to walk Meghan down the aisle.Since then, he has given numerous bizarre interviews to the press about his failing relationship with his daughter.He is not Meghans only family member to have undermined Meghan in her new position.Her half-sister, Samantha Markle, has launched a stream of vitriolic snipes at the Duchess - despite not having seen her for years.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

temper","story":"Stephen Waterson, , son of ex-MP Nigel Waterson, allegedly crushed Alfie Lamb either because he wanted more leg room or because he was annoyed, the prosecution said.Duncan Atkinson QC told jurors that Alfies mother Adrian Hoare, , failed her son fundamentally and fatally during the car journey to Croydon, south London, on February  last year.The couple are on trial at the Old Bailey accused of Alfies manslaughter.In a closing speech, Mr Atkinson said Alfie was a happy, active, smiley child.He warned jurors that they should guard against an emotional response to his death when they decide their verdicts.He said: No one is going to suggest either of these defendants wanted Alfie to die.In text messages between them they just wanted their little fatty back, they just wanted him home.Each of them may have called him a little s**t but neither of them set out to hurt him in the way that they did.The question for you is whether Alfie died because without any thought for the consequences, Stephen Waterson moved his chair back, whether because he wanted more room or because Alfie was annoying him, putting Alfie at risk, lashing out at him with his car seat in a fit of childish temper.The further question is whether the person Alfie was most entitled in the whole world to rely on when that happened, and had a duty to protect him from such harm, failed him fundamentally and fatally.Failed him by putting him in such a dangerous place which is why children have car seats, which is why you would never think of putting a child in a footwell.The lawyer told jurors they must look at whether Hoares failing to act was such a fundamental dereliction of duty to her son that she too could be held responsible for his death.He said: Alfie did not have enough room to breathe and that became the case after he was in the footwell and he was compressed in that way either for a short period followed by another period but in any view long enough to cause those irreversible injuries.Mr Atkinson said it was not only the pathology evidence which suggested Alfie died of compression during the journey in Watersons Audi convertible from Sutton to Croydon.The lawyer reminded jurors of the evidence of the other occupants of the car, Emilie Williams and Marcus Lamb.He said: Emilie and Marcus each has much to be criticised for on any view, each could have done more for Alfie by refusing to get in the car at all, by insisting on car seats, by insisting Alfie was not on the floor.You may think their failings cannot absolve any of these defendants for their responsibility for what happened.Watersons three previous convictions for battery also indicated the defendant would lash out violently when challenged, the court heard.Mr Atkinson added that neither of the defendants had explained the expert findings about Alfies injuries because they cannot admit what Stephen Waterson did and Adrian Hoare failed to stop.Hoare, who is originally from

Temperatures could reach Clater this week in the southern half of the UK.Mid February - Valentines Day - often brings some of the coldest weather of the UK winter but this year it looks like many of us can expect an early taste of spring.The mild conditions are the result of the UK being sandwiched between high pressure over the near continent and areas of low pressure in the Atlantic. They combine to leave the UK under a south or southwesterly air stream which pulls warm air up from northern Africa.Although most computer models show the likelihood of above temperatures for much of the rest of February it is too early to write off the winter. If the continental high pressure block migrates northwards it could open the floodgates to very cold air from the north or east.The warmest Valentines Day on record was in , when .C was clocked in Trivington in Somerset.Although bookies are saying we could see ven hotter this week, the Met Office has said its unlikely.Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: Things look set to take a sizzling turn with every Brit strapping themselves in for their hottest Valentines Day yet - at least on the weather front!The average temperature for this time of year is C in the north and C in the south, but were set to see much higher temperatures this week - the likes of which are normally only seen in spring time.Met Office forecaster Luke Miall told The Sun Online: Most places will have a fine day with lots of sunshine around with mild weather for this time of year. But maximum temperatures will be about C.The highs will most likely be on the north coast of Scotland or the north coast of Wales as a south westerly wind pushes through.It is seeming quite spring-like throughout this week.But its certainly not the end of the cold weather as the mild patch isnt likely to last - a repeat of last Marchs Beast from the East freeze is possible this year.John Hammond, chief meteorologist for Weather Trending, told The Sun Online: We could well see the warmest day of the year so far later this week. On balance, Thursday or Friday could see temperatures reaching the mid-teens in a few places. While this will feel springlike, it’s actually not that unusual for late February.It would be a brave person to say that we’ve said goodbye to the wintry weather. As we saw with last year’s ‘Beast from the East, severe cold and snow can happen in March. But this was an extreme and record-breaking event, so by definition, a repeat this year is unlikely.Indeed, at the moment, there are no indications from computer models for a cold spell as harsh as last year. That said, computer forecasts have been very poor through this winter, so they should not be taken on face value.Snowfalls often occur in March, and so it would unusual for parts of the UK not to see any more of the white stuff this year. However, at this stage it’s impossible to say where or when."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000468596707.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brewery boss response wealthy educated customer criticise food","story":"The pointed email was sent to By The River Brew Cos Träkol Restaurant in Newcastle by a businessman who claims to have eaten in the best restaurants in Newcastle, Europe and the Caribbean.Since opening in a shipping container village on the Gateshead side of the Tyne last summer, By The River Brew Co has become a popular drinking spot for craft beer lovers and its food has been noted by The Michelin Guide.But this customer who says he was born and bread in Newcastle wasnt so keen on the restaurant, saying hed never eaten such crap food in crap surroundings.In an email to bosses he wrote: Self employed from a wealthy background and well educated .I have eaten in the best restaurants of Newcastle, Europe and the Caribbean.I can honestly say I have never eaten such crap food in crap surroundings and payed at least four times what the food was worth.I appreciate your venture is high risk so probably need a quickbut...

March is going to be frantic, then come March  this is when things need to culminate.They said a compromise could include a commitment to review the need for the backstop every six months with more weight given to tech advances.The diplomat said: Then May could argue shes introduced a possibility that could curb the backstop to one or two years.Officials would perform a surgical keyhole operation on the Withdrawal Agreement to add the extra wording as a protocol, making it legally binding.But the diplomat warned: We really wouldnt accept a backstop which in essence or practice would be time-limited.An EU official told The Sun a clarication of the review clause is one of a number of avenues being explored by British and European negotiators.Tweaking that part of the text would allow new legal guarantees to be added without tearing up the whole Withdrawal Agreement.But the two sides disagree over what new wording would be added, with the UK still holding out for a time limit or unilateral exit clause.They said: The problem is on the substance. We disagree on the content. The EU cant give what the UK is requesting in terms of a limit.The official added Brussels is gearing up for a showdown at the summit in late March after Theresa May put back an update to MPs until February .Evena deal was signed then, officials anticipate a short extension of Article  would be needed to allow time for ratication by both sides.Alongside changes to the Withdrawal Agreement, member states are also mulling how they can give the much-derided Political Declaration more legal force.Sources said options under consideration include turning it into a legal instrument or depositing it at the UN.Mrs May could then argue Brussels was bound to pursue a trade deal by the end of the transition that would mean the backstop was never needed.The official said the plan could be made more committal but can never have the value of a treaty because it deals with events after the UK has left.But they stressed the text is already the most solemn political commitment you can get and a bottom line offer were not going to climb down from.The diplomat explained: Thats the package you could agree to on March . I cannot see the leaders going beyond that.Yesterday MEPs Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt said the Political Declaration could be easily strengthened and made more binding to convince MPs.He said: There are certainly several possibilities to do so and one way certainly to strengthen the wording that is used.To upgrade the Political Declaration is certainly a way forward but let’s be honest you can only do that when you have a position by the UK on this.Meanwhile Maltese Finance Minister Edward Scicluna warned no deal would be like an atomic bomb for everybody.He said: Brinkmanship can never be forecast and it’s very uncertain one could slip and then it’s history.You really can’t unfortunately predict what the outcome is going to be, it could go both ways and that’s what’s bad about it now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The ranch worker, who asked not to be named, said she complained to bosses twice. The first occasion was in January .A source claimed: “She said Green came up to her and smacked her on the butt several times vigorously.”Two years later he put his hand on her bottom for around ten seconds during a hug, she alleged.She also said he made sexually suggestive comments, including a quip about her wanting to tie men up, and grabbed her hips from behind and patted her bare stomach.A source said: “She said she was really shaken up. If it had happened outside of work, she probably would have punched him in the face.”They added: “Staff at the ranch live in fear of him.

MPs unanimously voted for the tycoon to be stripped of his gong in October .Mr Field said: “The House of Commons voted for him to lose his peerage long before the current revelations. Those revelations make it even more urgent for the Prime Minister to act.” Any decision to remove a knighthood rests with the Honours Forfeiture Committee.The Whitehall  has previously stripped honours from former RBS boss Fred “The Shred” Goodwin and Rolf Harris. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I will read one of the contributions from a parent, which puts the point very well: “I would defy anyone to try and get five teenagers out of bed every day at .am and not feel, as I do, that this is far too early!Having to wake five teens at .am each day is like trying to raise the dead.He also pointed out that the petition was the most engaged post ever on Parliament’s Instagram account with , people taking part in a survey,  per cent of whom were students.Wythenshaw Labour MP Mike Kane added: Children across the world are sleeping less.Here in the UK, the national health service is seeing more serious problems than before, with hospital attendances for children under  with sleep disorders tripling in the past  years.An Open University study found that when students in their mid-teens started school at am rather than .am rates of illness dropped by more than half over a two-year period, and they also got signicantly better grades.Other MPs also cited the benefits, including Henley Conservative MP John Howell, who said it could aid students mental health.But in an official response, the Department for Education said there were no legal requirements on when the school day starts.The decision on when to start the school day lies with inidual schools, they said.Last year a sleep study was undertaken by Birmingham University to explore how teenagers sleep patterns would be impacted by a am start to the school day.   "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000468711047.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"lottery winner scream mask collects jamaican lottery prize","story":"The winner apparently didn’t want anyone to know that he’d scooped the le-changing sum of cash.The lucky man, who was only identied as A.

The BBC — fuelled by £billion of public money — has expanded into a state-backed media monster encroaching on areas that should be none of its business, from trivial “clickbait” stories to lestyle advice.After all, the BBC Charter states that it should “provide impartial news and information to help people understand  the world around them. It should offer depth and analysis not widely available from other UK news providers”.Somewhere, this has gone very wrong.It churns out so much stuff online that it could be renamed the British Publishing Corporation.In the process, the monster is devouring the market for everything from local newspapers to gossip websites.Why does “our” national broadcaster now feel obliged to publish “news” stories such as the classic “Serial poopers: What makes people poop in public ” The BBC is also hopelessly addicted to pumping out recipes. Type in “spaghetti bolognese” on Google and the first result that s is from BBC Good Food — a commercial site that trades on the broadcaster’s brand.Why is the BBC even in the already-crowded recipe market  Never heard the one about “too many cooks” By stretching its insensitive tentacles into local areas from its London and Salford HQs, the BBC has contributed to wrecking the local and regional Press, longstanding voices of real communities.At least  local and regional titles have closed since , as circulation halved from .million weekly in  to .million in .Since , the number of regional journalists has also been halved, to around ,.An estimated  per cent of the country now has no daily or weekly title.A robotic BBC web page is no substitute for local Press coverage of council meetings and court proceedings.And yet the money pours in to fund this expansion way beyond its remit.Last year the BBC spent £million on BBC Online and “Red Button” services. The national and local Press are under siege from the tech giants and their BBC collaborators. But this is about more than newspaper self-interest.The future of dirt-digging journalism and democratic debate is at stake.Cairncross estimates that “legacy newsbrands” — aka national and local newspapers — are responsible for around  per cent of all original news journalism in the UK, more than broadcasters and online-only outlets put together. That seems an underestimate.The role of the Press in reporting the news is not just a matter of historical “legacy”. As one ex-editor of a London local paper observes, “councillors and crooks must surely feel relaxed” without local hacks watching and reporting what they are up to.Every big story of recent years was broken by newspapers, from the fire risk Vauxhall Zafira and how Age UK pushed expensive power deals to OAPsto Philip Green gagging reports of sexual and racial harassment .Even last year’s most popular BBC-based story — the snogging scandal on Strictly Come Dancing — was a Sun on Sunday exclusive, before the BBC did its usual parasitical trick of topping Google searches for articles about “the Strictly Curse”.The newspaper tradition of long-form writing and forensic examination will continue to struggle as the online purveyors suck up adverts for cheap and cheerful clickbait.The print medium remains unmatched for serious analysis.Yet the BBC’s self-aggrandising aim is now to expand its global audience further, rather than meet the needs of the underserved as a public service broadcaster surely should.Thus the social media chief of BBC News, Mark Frankel, boasts of the corporation having on Facebook “the largest news page and total fanbase of any news organisation in the world”.The publicly funded BBC need not care that the tech giants don’t pay for stories, as for them Facebook is just a free publicity funnel.That alliance makes it even harder for the rest of the media to take a stand against being royally ripped off.Auntie is effectively in league with greed-driven tech giants.What of the output of all these BBC s  They claim to be a beacon of liberal ersity.The one thing the BBC can’t tolerate, however, is ersity of opinion.It is a bastion of illiberal luvvie smugness, peddling its elitism as the centre ground, blasting out conformist propaganda in Brexit-bashing  debates and Brexit-bashing comedy shows.Lord Reith, the first BBC chief, wanted the then-monopoly corporation to “inform, educate and entertain” the public, from the point of view of the British Establishment.Reith’s successors might have quite a dferent world view.But the new BBC establishment —  managers paid between £, to £, a year,  on between £, to £, — would love to have a state-backed news monopoly again, educating and informing the ignorant public, whether we like it or not.Those of us who appreciate the importance of a vibrant and erse media to democracy, should tell the BBC to get its tanks off the free Press’s lawn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A cross-party group has been holding secret talks to draw up a fresh version of an amendment tabled by Labour MP Yvette Cooper to extend article .The move, expected to be announced this evening, comes after the Prime Minister asked the Commons for another fortnight’s grace to continue talks with the EU. Mrs May said she needed more time but confirmed they would get another chance to have their say in votes on Brexit on February . But the Remainer MPs want to put her on notice that she will not be able to delay her Brexit “high noon” beyond that point. The Mirror has learned that Ms Cooper plans to table a Brexit amendment along with Tory grandee Sir Oliver Letwin today or tomorrow.   But the pair are NOT expected to put their proposal to a vote until the end of the month - their best chance of getting it through Parliament. One source told the Mirror: “In terms of maximising Tory support for the plan, it’s clear they want to give her one final opportunity to get her deal. “So it’s likely that it will be put to a vote at the end of the month, rather than now. At that stage, there are likely to be Tory resignations over it.” Ms Cooper and Mr Letwin’s plan would remove the time limit for delaying Brexit Day from an earlier version of the amendment, which was defeated by MPs in January. Instead it would make the PM decide theof the extension she would be forced to request from Brussels. Mrs May would also be compelled to give MPs a formal vote before crashing out of the EU without a deal.A handful of Remainer ministers have pledged to quit Governmentthe PM adopts a no deal Brexit policy - or appears to be slipping towards one.  They are thought to include some in Mrs May’s own cabinet including Justice Secretary David Gauke, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and Business Secretary Greg Clark. The Commons rejected an earlier amendment by Ms Cooper that would have forced the PM to ask Brussels for a formal extension to article . The shock defeat,  votes to , came as a crushing disappointment for Remainers who widely expected to block a damaging no deal Brexit. Despite support from the Labour front bench,  Labour rebels turned against the amendment, balancing out  Tory rebels voted in favour of delaying Brexit. One of their key concerns was a suggested delay of nine months in the planned bill. The Labour party agreed to back the movethat was brought down to three months. Ms Cooper has insisted throughout that her aim has been to give the Government more time to negotiate a deal, rather than an attempt to stop Brexit.

Up to  Department for Work and Pensionsagents in Wolverhampton and Walsall are poised to walk out for two days in a row over heavy workloads. The PCS union says the system is crippled by severe under investment, staff shortages and criticism from claimants on how they are treated. Chiefs are demanding , new staff, full contracts for fixed-term workers, an end to management by statistics and a limit on the number of phone calls each case manager has to handle. It comes after top Tories heaped praise on rank-and-file staff in their defence of the six-in-one social security shake-up. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said the strike ballot - which runs to February  - must be a wake-up call to ministers.   He added: Ministers have repeatedly insisted Universal Credit is working well for workers and claimants when the opposite is in fact the case. “Our members have not taken the decision to ballot lightly. But the responsibility for the breakdown in industrial relations lies squarely with the government, who want to run this service into the ground while treating staff with contempt.” If union members at the two service centres agree, two days of industrial action would take place on March -. It comes four years since , Universal Credit staff staged a -hour walkout in protest at the oppressive workplace culture. They complained of staff shortages, poor training and at least poundm squandered on IT that wasnt used.  DWP chiefs insisted their priority was to give UC staff the necessary resources to carry out their job, including manageable workloads. However, contingency plans have been reviewed recently to ensure services can be maintainedthere is a strike. An official insisted there would be no disruption to claimants.

He was a man of incredible optimism. “Harry has gone but the baton now falls to his son, John. But it also falls to all of us to deliver his dream of a better society – and we will.”  The ceremony was held in Conway Hall, Central London. The congregation of more than  sang his favourite song, Danny Boy, before Daily Mirror Associate Editor, Kevin Maguire, said: “Harry was always a le force, and he would want you to remember him with cheers and laughter – but cryyou want to.”  Mr Corbyn then recalled how Harry was born into poverty in Barnsley, South Yorks, in , the son of an injured, unemployed miner. Harry was three when his elder sister, Marion, , died of tuberculosis in a workhouse. It sparked his lelong support for a National Health Service, which inspired the most memorable line of his Labour speech: “Mr Cameron – keep your mitts of my NHS.” Harry went on to serve with the RAF in the Second World War. Mr Corbyn said: “Harry hated poverty because he grew up in poverty. He hated class shyprivilege because of his sister’s death. And, as one who had seen what war was about, he dedicated his le to peace.”  Later in le, Harry became an author and activist – dubbing himself “the world’s oldest rebel”.His book, Harry’s Last Stand, became a huge hit and he gathered , Twitter followers.Mirror columnist and friend, Ros Wynne Jones, said of Harry’s Labour conference speech: “I remember sitting at the back of the conference hall with tears pouring down my face, watching his galvanising effect on a movement.”  Harry’s son, John, talked about his hope that his work would continue. And Unite’s general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: “Harry was a giant and it is our duty to stand on his shoulders.” But the last words went to Harry: “I write, speak and fight for the underdogs of society because that will be my legacy – a reminder that all of us have a part to play in making the world a better place.” And, as everyone got up from their seats to leave for the night, they all silently vowed to stand with Harry.

I couldn’t wait to meet this amazing man I’d heard about. An old soldier, who at the age of , was taking one Last Stand to fight for the NHS his generation had built. By the time we’d finished our interview at a pub in Soho, I’d already invited him to speak at the Mirror and Unite fringe event at Labour Conference. His effect on me had been one of total inspiration – and I knew as many others as possible had to hear his heartfelt and hopeful message. Harry had that effect wherever he went. When he came to our fringe event,  people stood up and gave him a standing ovation.   News of his speech spread like wildfire, and he was invited onto the main stage of the conference, during the NHS debate, where he once again lit up the stage. I remember sitting at the back of the conference hall with tears pouring down my face, watching his galvanising effect on a movement feeling the despair of watching austerity destroy what good people had built. After that speech, of course, the rest is history. But then Harry, as he often used to remind us, was history. Harry and John and I became friends after that. And I doubt I was the only person who took a little fix of hope from him every time I saw his smile wheel into view. Harry had an incredible quality of never seeming tired, even though he must have been, the weight of all that history on his shoulders. John did the most extraordinary job of keeping him going with cups of tea, warm words, halves of beer and sometimes glasses of champagne. I loved that Harry was a champagne socialist. The last time I met Harry was last winter. We were making our last little film for the Wigan Pier Project in Barnsley, and I knew it had to be about Harry.   In , George Orwell had described the terrible conditions in the town where was born. But, as the child of an injured miner, Harry had lived that poverty. And his sister Marion – the inspiration behind everything he did shy– had died of it. Because he was soon leaving for Canada, there was only week Harry could go to Barnsley to work on the film, which turned out to be quite a busy weekend for me. And so it was that I spent my honeymoon at Hoyland Working Men’s Club in Barnsley, with Harry. And I’m glad I did. He had made the journey to Yorkshire without telling me he actually had a terrible chest infection, and he seemed more vulnerable, and less immortal, than usual. A little bit closer to the past. He started telling me, Claire Donnelly, and Scott and Natasha from Northern Heart films about the grocery bicycle he once borrowed as a boy, and it was extraordinary, watching his memories roll past. I miss Harry very much. But in these raucous, dficult times when it can be hard to hear the voice of your moral compass above the political sound and fury, all we need ask ourselves is #WhatWouldHarryDo  His message was very clear. Harry called on all of us to gather the spirit of his generation into our hearts “to begin the task of rebuilding this country, Europe and the world as it should be.” And that’s the work we all now pledge to take on today.

Mr Robbins reportedly said MPs would be faced with the choice of backing the Prime Ministers plan or delaying Brexit for a long time to extend talks. According to ITVs Angus Walker, Mr Robbins apparently told two colleagues: The issue is whether Brussels is clear on the terms of extension. In the end they will probably just give us an extension.” Referring to MPs, he reportedly said: Got to make them believe that the week beginning end of March... Extension is possible butthey don’t vote for the deal then the extension is a long one.   A government spokesperson said: “We don’t propose to comment on alleged remarks from a private conversation. The government’s focus is on securing the improvements Parliament needs to pass a deal so we leave the EU on th March.” Brexiteer Tory Steve Baker MP said: As a consummate civil servant, Mr Robbins is likely to be appalled by this story.Officials advise. Ministers decide. What matters ultimately is the policy of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. LeaveMeans Leave Chairman John Longworth said: If it is true that Britain’s Chief Negotiator was carelessly briefing in abar on the U.K. position in the Brexit negotiations, it clearly demonstrates the casual overreach of Olly Robbins.It is not for a civil servant to be speculating publicly on any matter, let alone one of such national importance and it is not for a civil servant to be formulating policy publicly.Politicians are elected to formulate policy and the PM to lead on the private advice of civil servants, who they can choose to ignore. It appears that Robbins has once again stepped well over the mark and one wonders where his interests lie. Meanwhile, Theresa May has set out plans to short circuit parliamentary rules in order to get a Brexit deal ratied in time for the UK to leave the EU on March . The Prime Minister told MPs that she would enable the House of Commons to lt a requirement for a -day delay before any vote to approve an international treaty.But Labour pledged to oppose the move, accusing the Government of showing contempt for our democracy.  The announcement came as Mrs May urged MPs to hold their nerve and support her efforts to secure a withdrawal deal which will deliver Brexit on time. In a statement updating the Commons on progress in talks, Mrs May acknowledged she would need some time to seek legally-binding changes from the EU to the controversial backstop for the Irish border. She confirmed that she will table an amendable motion for debate on Thursday, seeking the Houses continued support for her to demand alternative arrangements to keep the border open after Brexit. And she pledged toon February  with a further statement - triggering another debate and votes the following day -she has not secured a deal by that date. If a deal is agreed, MPs will have a second meaningful vote, like the one in January which saw Mrs Mays original plan rejected by a record-breaking  votes.

Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC alleged the three-year-old suffered irreversible injuries when his mothers boyfriend twice reversed his chair into him as he sat in a footwell of his Audi convertible. But a defence lawyer for Stephen Waterson suggested Alfie could have died because his head was pushed down as he cried himself to sleep between his mother Adrian Hoares legs. Waterson, , son of ex-minister Nigel Waterson, and hairdresser Hoare, , have both denied responsibility for Alfies death. In his closing speech, Mr Atkinson said Waterson pushed his seat back because he wanted more leg room or he was annoyed at the crying child. And Hoare fundamentally and fatally failed her son by doing nothing on the journey home to Croydon, south London, on February  last year, jurors heard.  Mr Atkinson said: No one is going to suggest either of these defendants wanted Alfie to die. In text messages between them they just wanted their little fatty back, they just wanted him home. The question for you is whether Alfie died because without any thought for the consequences, Stephen Waterson moved his chair back whether because he wanted more room or because Alfie was annoying him, putting Alfie at risk, lashing out at him with his car seat in a fit of childish temper. The further question is whether the person Alfie was most entitled in the whole world to rely on when that happened, and had a duty to protect him from such harm, failed him fundamentally and fatally. Failed him by putting him in such a dangerous place which is why children have car seats, which is why you would never think of putting a child in a footwell.  He said neither of the defendants had explained the pathologists findings because they cannot admit what Stephen Waterson did and Adrian Hoare failed to stop. The lawyer reminded jurors that the other occupants of the car, Emilie Williams and Marcus Lamb, had said Waterson moved his seat back into Alfie. Watersons three previous convictions for battery indicated he would lash out violently when challenged, the court heard. Mr Atkinson said Waterson orchestrated and developed a series of lies, all designed to protect himself and avoid blame. You may think there is clear evidence of him seeking to manipulate those who were in the car with him and others, including his adopted mother, getting them to lie or blaming them, he said.  Waterson lied in an initial  call, at the hospital and again as he was quizzed by police about an incident in Crystal Palace Park when he allegedly put his foot on Mr Lambs head, accusing him of being a grass, jurors heard. The prosecutor said: Mr Waterson has everything to hide and everything to play for in that interview. Tana Adkin, QC, for Waterson, told jurors her client was very easy to dislike and easy to blame. She said: This case is tragic and you may think it is obvious that Stephen Waterson has not helped himself by the lies he has told, by his behaviour, but it does not mean he is guilty.  She said there were very real question marks over whether Waterson moved his chair back more than once. Ms Adkin suggested that while the chair could have been part of a domino effect, another explanation for the fatal injuries involved Alfies head being pushed down as he cried himself to sleep. Hoare, who is originally from north Kent, denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Emilie Williams, who was in the car. Waterson has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and intimidation of the driver Marcus Lamb. The couple and Williams have pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making  statements to police.

They tied the knot in December , with James riding his beloved Ariel Red Hunter motorcycle back from his job as a Bevin Boy in the Welsh mines to marry his sweetheart. Today the couple live at Bupa Abbotsleigh Mews care home in Sidcup, South East London, where the staff make sure they’re still able to spend time together.  As they prepared for their th Valentines Day together, Cecilia put their lelong love down to communication and the fact they always worked together to iron out any problems. She added: “I never thought James and I would still be together after all this time. “Especially after he was called up to the mines during the war – he had no option, he was going whether we liked it or not.

The -year-old student can be seen walking towards The Welly Club on January  at about .pm. She is reported to have arrived at the club with three friends. However the student was turned away by doormen who believed she was too drunk before friends put her into a taxi to go home. The new footage was recorded by a camera on a business next to the club in Hull.   The owner of the CCTV, property agent Lukasz Rybus told the Daily Mail: I want Libby to be found, to be back with her family and friends. This footage shows that she was dressed all in black and seems to be wearing lighter coloured trainers or boots. I just hope that this footage helps jog someones memory,it helps someone remember seeing her, that can only be a positive thing. Libby arrived home about two miles away on Wellesley Avenue at .pm - although she is not thought to have entered the property for reasons which are not known.  She was seen on Beverley Road at .pm near to a bench and close to the junction with Haworth Street, when a motorist stopped and offered her help. Humberside Police believe she may have been in this area until around .am. The investigation is still being treated as a missing persons enquiry by the force.  Polish-born butcher Pawel Relowicz, , a married father-of-two, was arrested last Wednesday, on suspicion of abduction. He was questioned by detectives until Sunday night when he was bailed but he remains a suspect. A massive search has been underway since the day following her disappearance, with dozens of officers seen combing nearby streets including Beresford Avenue and Haworth Street, as well as the nearby Barmston Drain.  Some officers remain at Oak Road playing fields and are now using chainsaws to clear some of the vegetation in the search area. A number of police officers have conducted door-to-door enquiries, while Humberside Police also launched a digital billboard campaign in a bid to find the missing student. Search teams with wooden sticks and police ers have also been used in the search although they have still been unable to find her.  More than  students from the University of Hull handed out leaflets on the streets of Hull last week. The flyers, produced in four dferent languages, appealed for any information that could lead to finding Libby. A ft wide billboard asking for information was also stationed outside The Welly. Detective Superintendent Matthew Hutchinson said on Saturday: We are still treating Libbys disappearance as a missing persons inquiry.  I have said previously that we are keeping an open mind as to her whereabouts and that is still very much the case. Our number one priority is to find Libby Squire and we are still conducting extensive searches and appealing for any information from the public.

Christopher McMahon, , left David Potter, , for dead face down on the floor of his flat in Tooting, south London, after repeatedly stabbing him in the early hours of August  last year, the Old Bailey was told. This was after he told McMahon that he had sexually abused a six-year-old. Mr Potter, who had convictions for sex offences against children, was found dead five days later after police forced entry to his property when a friend became concerned. The jury was told that after the incident, McMahon went to his on-off partners house still soaked in his alleged victims blood and told her: Ive done it. Prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse QC told jurors: Mr McMahon said he had slit a mans throat and indeed he had. She said McMahon told his partner the man was a paedophile who told him he had molested a six-year-old. Mr McMahon admits he was the person who stabbed Mr Potter to death, Ms Whitehouse told jurors. The question for you will be why Mr McMahon did that.  The court heard McMahon had been in possession of a Stanley kne at his girlfriends flat a few days before the alleged murder. On the night of August , he was drinking at Mr Potters small studio apartment above a convenience store, where he lived alone, while another man left in the early hours of the following day. There is no doubt that in the early hours of that morning Mr McMahon stabbed Mr Potter repeatedly, Ms Whitehouse said. His clothing and shoes were covered in Mr Potters blood and the trainers he was wearing left footprints in blood all over Mr Potters flat. After stabbing Mr Potter in the early hours of that morning, Mr McMahon left him dead or dying face down on the floor of the flat. Police officers found Mr Potter in a pool of blood when they forced entry to his home on March . A post-mortem examination found he had a number of stab wounds to the neck, the most severe of which had gone through to the spine and cut numerous blood vessels including the jugular vein. Mr Potter also had defence wounds to his left arm and hands, the court was told. McMahon, of no fixed address, denies murder and the trial continues.

His wild claims that the Duchess of Sussex is being “pursued, vilied and chased” while comparing her to Princess Diana are so wide of the mark and ultimately do her no favours. It’s fair to say there has been some uncomfortable headlines for Meghan but to suggest she’s being hounded by photographers or “the media” - as so manykeyboard warriors would like to believe - is simply not true. The real people hounding her are her family. Her father who has now been shown to be a liar.   Who showed her no respect as she was about to embark on her most important time in her le and who refused to interject when his other daughter made hurtful slurs to stretch out her own five minutes of dubious fame. The overwhelming majority of coverage from the British press concerning Meghan has been hugely positive. She was welcomed as a breath of fresh air even before she became a permanent fixture within the royal family. She’s already made great headway in raising the profile of the causes she is passionate about - women’s empowerment, education, the arts - and been widely celebrated as a force for good.   On her first royal tour in Australia and surrounding nations with Prince Harry, there was acres of coverage about how fantastically well she had been received. However, over the last year there has been a very damaging fallout with her father and her extended family. Is this to be completely ignored  There are two sides to every story after all. Some will say the time to call time on the row is now and whatever way you look at it, the complete and utter breakdown of her relationship with her father is a tragedy. The more Thomas, Meghan or her celebrity friends talk about it, the longer it will hang around, and no whitewashing of the truth from any side will make it go away.

Hannah Morris, , was devastated when she lost her amniotic fluid just  weeks after falling pregnant with twins and claims that doctors repeatedly urged her to abort. But the brave mum-of-three says she acted on a gut instinct and refused to follow the doctors advice - and is now proud mum to two-year-olds George and Alfie King. Hannah was diagnosed with preterm premature rupture of the membraneswhen her first amniotic sac burst at  weeks and second around three weeks later. She claims an untreated E. coli infection may have caused her waters to break  weeks early. Both children were left vulnerable to infection in the womb and doctors reportedly said it was unlikely their vital organs would develop properly and their limbs would be stuck together. Hannah claims that doctors recommended terminating her pregnancy as a get out clause to treating the babies.  She is now speaking out to call for better education for doctors and awareness for the public on the pregnancy complication. Hannah, from Washington, Tyne and Wear, said: The negativity from the NHS was absolutely abominal. She added: A lot of the doctors had not go a clue what to do with me. It was like it was their get out clause to say have a termination because it was easier to say get rid of the babies than to actually treat PPROM. There needs to be more education and they need to be taught what to do. The compassion that they had in that situation was so cold and so negative that when I was trying to fight for my babies lives it felt like they didnt care. I understand the NHS is under massive strain and theyre trying to make savings, but I was trying to save my babies.   I wasnt given a leaflet, I wasnt given any advice or counselling. Nothing like that was provided. I had to sort out help on my own. For somebody  who is maybe a little less savvy or emotional and cant deal with the situation as well, they wouldnt necessarily go and look for help. You trust your doctor and what they say to you you think is going to be the right option. You trust the medical professionals that are looking after you. They completely failed me. If I had listened to these people I would have terminated my pregnancy and my sons wouldnt be here today. Its devastating. Hannah and her partner Mark King, , were over the moon when they found out that they were going to have twins in January . A urine sample taken at Hannahs -week scan revealed that the mum-to-be had an asymptomatic E. coli infection but she claims that she was not treated with antibiotics. After her waters broke for the first time, Hannah claims she was rushed to Bolton Royal Hospital and the couple were heartbroken when they were warned that neither child had any chance of surviving.Hannah, who is a stay-at-home mum, said: I had an internal examination and the doctor told me that my waters had broken, and he was really sorry but there was nothing they could do for us.   I asked a million questions, can the other baby survive  Can it reseal  They said, no, there was a  per cent chance that this baby wont survive, you need to have to have some medicine to induce labour, its your only option. For some reason, I dont know why, I didnt want to do that. My gut was telling me not to follow the advice. I said  I am going to lose them I lose them naturally and Ill let nature take its course. The doctor left me in this side room and not one single doctor or nurse or healthcare professional came in this room for  hours. They just left me and my partner to miscarry our children. After two days of waiting in hospital to miscarry, a scan revealed that both babies appeared healthy and the couple were sent home. Hannah turned to voluntary organisation Little Heartbeats for support and decided to put herself on bedrest to give her babies the best chance of survival. She would lose water every time she moved and found even simple tasks such as going to the toilet extremely dficult.   She avoided baths and drank up to eight litres of water a day to keep her water supplies as replenished as possible. Hannah said: A week after I was first in hospital I had a follow-up appointment and we met with a doctor who put a care plan in place for us but told usthey got to  weeks, which is viability, their limbs would be stuck to their bodies. [They told us] their lungs wont be developed and their kidneys wont be developed. Choosing to carry on was immensely inhumane and was the worst thing I could do because my babies were  per cent goners. [They said] I was only causing them more pain by carrying on with the pregnancy. We were considering at this point terminating the pregnancies because this was coming from top consultants. We went home to think about it and I decided to do my own research and found Little Heartbeats and information on PPROM and found that there were charities out there who support women going through this. Every day was touch and go. Each time I would go to the toilet I would lose fluid. Every time I stood up I would lose waters. I knew that it was a really serious thing. If I had been walking around I would have lost my children. The NHS didnt advise me to go on bed rest, it was from my own research that I decided that was the best option. I avoided baths and swimming pools. I was drinking water as much as I could to replenish what I was losing, seven or eight litres a day. It was really, really dficult to stay positive and stay mentally sane as well. It was extremely dficult and we did feel very isolated as a family as well. But we knew that we were having a scan every week too. Each week we would go for this scan and we would be reassured that the scan showed our babies were healthy and fine. Thats what pushed us to carry on with the pregnancy every single week. We would see the boys on the screen and they would be fine. Against all the odds, Hannah made it to  weeks and planned a C-section with her doctors. George was born first weighing lb oz and Alfie at lb oz, and both spent four days in NICU. Despite Alfie being born with holes in his heart and George suffering a weakened immune system due to his premature birth, both toddlers are now healthy and thriving. Hannah said: Taking our boys home was amazing. Just to know that we were right and that we had made the right decision by our children. They had defeated all the odds and they were strong, healthy little boys. They are now so cheeky and you look at them and think, wow, you nearly werent here. I think there needs to be more awareness of PPROM. We werent given any leaflets or help. Ciara Curran, founder of Little Heartbeats, said: Hannah and her little surviving PPROM babies are living proof these babies can survive with little to zero fluids. A spokesperson for Bolton NHS Foundation Trust said: We are really sorry to hear about this. We do not comment on inidual cases. However, we would be happy to meet with Hannah to discuss directly with her.

Lisa Davey had no clue she was expecting a child when she contracted sepsis and her health dramatically deteriorated. The -year-old was brought into AE at Blackpool Victoria Hospital in April last year with a suspected abdominal infection. Medics discovered she had a tiny tummy bump, which they initially thought could be linked to the possible infection. But an ultrasound revealed she was actually  weeks pregnant and had developed HELLP syndrome - a rare liver a blood clotting disorder and condition which affects pregnant women. As her health worsened and her organs began to fail, doctors took Lisa to theatre for a caesarean section to save both her and her baby.   Little Danielle Alice Davey was born  weeks early and transferred to the Neonatal Unit at Royal Preston Hospital for specialist care. Lisa - who had been working -hour weeks before she contracted sepsis - was moved to intensive care at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. Incredibly, she only discovered she was now a new mother when she woke up in her hospital bed. She said: I couldnt believe it. I had been working  hours a week and lting heavy boxes. I had no clue I was pregnant. I had no symptoms. The mum decided to name her miracle daughter after the wonderful nurse who treated them, Danielle McLardie. Danielle, , had just started her sht, with Lisa being her first patient. When I met my baby girl a week later, I knew I had to call her Danielle after the fantastic care I received from such a wonderful nurse, said Lisa.  Ten months on, both mum and baby are doing well and are enjoying a normal le in Blackpool, Lancashire. Danielle said: Lisa was so poorly, we didnt know her or the baby would make it. Nobody had a clue when she came in that Lisa was pregnant - including Lisa herself. There was only a tiny tummy bump which we thought could be linked to a possible infection. I stayed with Lisa for three and a half hours and visited her each time I was on sht. When Lisa told me the babys name, I cried I was so overwhelmed - I was just doing my job. But having such a cute bundle of joy named after me is such a huge honour, its the highlight of my career.

Pro-Kremlin media reports citing law enforcement sources alleged Frame had changed direction in the city when he saw a police patrol coming towards him. “They approached him and askedhe had drugs with him,” stated REN TV. “He confessed he had cocaine.

Moscow police had issued no statement on the case. It is understood British diplomats have been in touch with the Russian authorities on his detention.   Police had informed the British Embassy after he was held, said reports in Moscow. He was held at Khamovniki police station in Moscow, according to reports. The protege has enjoyed sensational success in Russia after completing his training at the Vaganova Ballet Academy in St Petersburg in . He was taught by legendary Bolshoi star Nikolay Tsiskaridze. One account in melmoth.blog said: “Oscar Frame found himself in a dficult, albeit enviable, position.  “The young Brit received job offers from both the Mariinsky and the Bolshoi – a happy predicament very few Vaganova graduates, let alone foreign trainees, ever find themselves facing. “After some deliberation, Frame settled on the Bolshoi, becoming one of the few foreigners to ever join the company.” He said: “My dream role at the moment is Romeo because I’d really like to try and conquer it, and it feels asit fits my abilities on stage.

According to forecasters, Valentines Day could see temperatures climb to the high teens - before warnings of another icy blast and possible snow storms sweeping across the UK towards the end of the month and into March. The so-called heatwave, given the time of year, is thanks to a blast of warm air and high pressure moving in from the Azores in Portugal, where temperatures are currently C. This means Britain could be welcoming average temperatures of C this February  - which would make it the warmest day of the year so far.  Director and forecaster for the Weather Outlook Brian Gaze said: The weather during the coming days will be very mild for mid February. Temperatures could reach Clater this week in the southern half of the UK., reports the Sun .He added: Mid February - Valentines Day - often brings some of the coldest weather of the UK winter but this year it looks like many of us can expect an early taste of spring. The mild conditions are the result of the UK being sandwiched between high pressure over the near continent and areas of low pressure in the Atlantic.   However, throughout most of February, forecasters have also warned of a possible second Beast from the East, a snap of winter weather which brought Britain to a standstill last year. John Hammond from Weathertrending said: Southern and eastern areas are most prone to a continental chill from February , with an ongoing chance easterly winds will bring much colder air towards us. Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge told the Daily Star: “Weve certainly not had the last cold spell of winter.   “There are cold spells likely in the period from February  until March . “We may see snow to low levels with nights below zero, although its too early to say how low temperatures will go. “Spring might officially start on March  but theres still potential cold ahead even in March.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man tried explain difference between","story":"NewsMan tried to explain dference between vagina and vulva - and it didnt go wellA guy got himself into a spot of trouble online after he tried to explain the dference between vulva and vagina to womenShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  FEB NewsA man has come under fire online for trying to explain the dference between vagina and vulva\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email On Sunday,published a photo story which looked at  dferent womens vulva.As youd expect, the article elicited a number of interesting responses from people on social media, with the story being shared more than , times.However there was one reply in particular that caught peoples eye on Twitter - but it captured attention for all the wrong reasons.A man named Paul Bullen replied to the newspaper, telling them: The correct word is vagina.

He said: I am making a factual claim about how most people do in fact refer to their genitalia. And I am defending their use. I am taking issue with those who are telling them they should not do that. Relatedly,a pregnant woman speaks about the baby in her belly, I would not tell her she should be referring to it as a fetus. Fetus is a technical term appropriate in scientic contexts.   Even a doctor does not ask Would you like to see the fetus. Over , responded to Pauls initial tweet, informing him that it was in fact he, who was incorrect - the photos were of the external female genitalia and thus were vulva. One person wrote: Imagine arguing to a woman what her own body parts are called. Ffs. Another commented: Even though its only February, I think it would be pretty safe to declare Paul the Mansplainer of the Year . This is hard to top.

The Bible story details how two of every type of animal are saved from floods by a huge boat. However, the Genesis story also goes on to say how humans in the aftermath of the deluge began to build the Tower of Babel. The huge structure is used to explain how erse human languages were brought into existence.  It says how in a bid to hamper the construction of the tower, which Babylonians claimed could reach the heavens, God confused the languages of the the workers so they could no longer communicate. The tower was never completed and people were dispersed across the face of the earth. Now the Bible Conspiracies documentary claims a discovery in the Babylon Province of Iraq matches the tale.  The presenter explains how archaeologists believe that the remains matched the description of the famous tower, due to the discovery of a series of cylinders surrounded by burnt bricks, the Daily Star reports. “The investigation goes on to explain how the Bible says the structure would later be destroyed by angels under God’s orders. “Many believe the tower was destroyed by God, but the text actually tells us it was a strange race, referred to as the Anunnaki.  “These Anunnaki were described as coming from the heavens, sent to guide humans. “In times gone by they were called angels, but today we might call them aliens.” Bible Conspiracies has been given . stars and is free to watch for members of the paid-for subscription service.  The documentary also claims the true son of God was not Jesus, but a Greek philospher. The -minute show says: Hidden in the Bible are ancient secrets. The marriage of Jesus and Mary and their children the destruction of the tower of Babel by an alien race called the Anunnaki, and the hidden code that holds the revelation about future events. One of the claims is that Jesus has been confused with a Greek philosopher who lived at the same time.  Stories shared in the Bible about Jesus le, and the miracles he performed in the New Testament, may have been mistaken forPreacher Apollonius of Tyan. The series claims Apollonius became famous, building a religious following as he preached and performed miracles. It says: “There is, in fact, a man who can be found in text outside of the Bible after the church failed to eradicate him from history. “His name is Apollonius and he was born in the rd or th year BC in Tyana in Cappadocia, Anatolia.  “He became a disciple of Pythagoras renouncing flesh, wine and women. He wore no shoes and let his hair and beard grow long. He reportedly restored le to the dead and spoke of things beyond the human reach.

These remarkable images, said to be the first clear ones in  years of the creature, show the leopard out hunting for prey. They were captured by Will Burrad-Lucas, , from Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, at Kenyas Laikipia Wilderness Camp last month. The wildle snapper took the unusual images using a Camtraptions Camera Trap - a camera which has a motion sensor to detect when animals are there. The high-quality system made it possible to see the majestic black leopard, a rarely photographed big cat, despite it being dark.  Wills images showcase the animals dazzling yellow eyes as it steps out in the night, under a full moon, to hunt for prey. The photographer said: I took the photos last month and believe the black panther, in this case a melanistic African leopard, is around two years old. Black panthers are iconic creatures and yet very few images of wild black panthers exist. This is not just because leopards are extremely secretive and hard to see, but also because only a tiny percentage of leopards are completely black.  Since childhood I have been fascinated by stories of black panthers. In Africa, black leopards are incredibly rare and until now, the only images of them have been fleeting shots taken from great distance or graining images from low-quality trail cameras. He added: As far as I know, this is the first series of high-quality camera trap images of a wild black leopard ever captured in Africa. The appearance of the animal - which has barely visible spots - is the result of melanism, Mail Online reports.The opposite of albinism, this rare genetic iation causes a surplus of pigment in an animals skin or hair.   In photographing the striking black leopard, Will said he had achieved his childhood dream.Nicholas Pilfold PhD, a lead researcher for a leopard conservation program in Laikipia County, Keyna, said: We had always heard about black leopard living in this region, but the stories were absent of high quality footage that could confirm their existence. The scientist at San Diego Zoo Global added: This is what Wills photos and the videos on our remote cameras now prove, and are exceptionally rare in their detail and insight. Collectively these are the first confirmed images in nearly  years of black leopard in Africa, and this region is the only known spot in all of Africa to have black leopard.

Kicking could do with improving, however.James HorsfieldAnother loanee, -year-old Horsfield is eager for game time after not featuring much for Scunthorpe this season.The former Man City kid, who has trained under Pep Guardiola, Manuel Pellegrini and Patrick Vieira, has shown a steady start at right-back both with the ball and defensively.Ryan McGowanThe Australian international has slotted in no problem at all and immediately strengthened the Dundee backline.Two strong performances already at centre-back, once he gets more settled there’s more to come.Andrew DaviesThe former Ross County skipper hasn’t had much luck in his time at Dens, breaking his foot in his first bounce game after signing.Injuries have been a feature of his career but all reports of his time in the Highlands and down south suggest, when he’s fit, he’s a strong leader at the back.Andreas HadeniusNot much was known about the big Swede before he signed for the Dark Blues just over a fortnight ago.We still don’t know too much but he’s shown in his two starts so far that he’s a ball-winner in the middle of the park who keeps possession ticking over.Ethan RobsonParent club Sunderland rate this kid highly and Jim McIntyre admitted he was surprised to be able to get the midfielder in on loan.His debut at Hamilton on Saturday largely passed him by before picking up a groin issue that kept him out of the - draw at Kilmarnock.Once up to speed, the hope is Robson can begin to realise the potential plenty down south recognise.John O’SullivanAnother loanee largely unknown up here, O’Sullivan made a fleeting debut at New Douglas Park last weekend.Andy DalesThe winger has made an impressive start to le up here. His direct, pacy running has caused defences plenty of problems but his final ball looks certain to frustrate Dees.Exciting player, though, and an asset to the team.Scott WrightThe talented forward hasn’t been able to push his way into Derek McInnes’ first team at Aberdeen yet and has joined Dundee to prove himself at this level.He’s fast becoming a favourite at Dens after a super goal at Hamilton and an impressive first-half showing against Kilmarnock.Craig CurranA frontman Jim McIntyre knows very well from his time at Ross County, Curran has shown he’ll work tirelessly and keep defenders honest. A tidy knock-down for the opening goal against Killie, too. More of that and the Dark Blues will be happy.Andrew NelsonWe were told the young striker was raw but full of talent and he’s shown that already. Three goals in five appearances have rocketed him to second-top scorer already this season but even when not scoring he gives defences a real headache.Will need support but already looks a real find."},{"url":null,"title":"no thanks dundee fans group rejects owners bid for full control of club","story":"Dundee’s most influential supporters group has politely knocked back a bid from Dark Blues owner Tim Keyes to take complete control at Dens Park.Last month it emerged the American millionaire wanted to buy the Dundee FC Supporters’ Society’s ‘A’ Ordinary Shares to take his overall stake in the club to over %.That would have ended the DFCSS’s power of veto over matters like a change of ownership, merger, moving to a new stadium and even substantial borrowing.That’s a condition of the sale of the majority holding Texas-based Keyes took on back in .Only the ‘A’ Ordinary shares that were created then, and are held by the society, include that power of veto.After consulting their -plus members, however, the society have given a thanks but no thanks to the plan for them to be sold.In doing so, however, they have stressed their support “in principal” for the plan to move to a new stadium near the city’s Campderdown Park.And they have stressed their willingness to consider any proposal from Dundee on its merits.The decision of the society’s board reflected the feedback after consulting members.Of that number just over half indicated a preference for holding onto the ‘A Ordinary’ shares but were willing to see a relaxation of certain rights to allow the stadium development to go ahead.Some % were in favour of maintaining the status quo, while % were willing to see the shares sold and a new shareholders agreement negotiated.Another issue is the fact while the existing rules of the DFCSS allow them to buy shares, there is no provision for the sale of any they hold.As well as informing their members, the society board have told Dundee of their decision.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game.

Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.

Alan McConnell, , admitted the offence when he appeared in Ayr Sherf Court. McConnell was drinking at home with his partner on December  last year. But at some point he left the address, in Prestwick’s Raith Avenue, said depute fiscal Lindzi Bayne. His partner went looking for him at a nearby corner shop, but he had driven off so shop staff contacted police. McConnell’s car was traced to Drongan, and he admitted he had driven there. The charge against him stated he drove on roads between Raith Avenue, Prestwick and Coronation Road, Drongan. A breath test revealed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath. The legal limit in Scotland is  microgrammes. The court heard that McConnell had been ‘just over’ the limit in an earlier drink-driving conviction. Defence lawyer John Gallagher said his client was well aware he could be sent to jail this time. However, he made a plea for a sentence of unpaid work on his client, now of Lane Crescent, Drongan. Sherf John Montgomery told McConnell: “You were driving at five times over the prescribed limit. “If you ever offend again like this, it is inevitable you are going to jail.” He imposed a four-year-driving ban on McConnell, and ordered him to do  hours of unpaid work in the community, within six months. There was another crumb of comfort for McConnell when the sherf refused a Crown motion to seize his car, worth pound.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrCourtsAlcoholDrink-drivingJusticePrestwickAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"retired girvan bank boss admits","story":"NewsRetired Girvan bank boss admits drink-driving offencesNeighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsWilliam Fairbairn is disqualied from the roads for three years\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA retired bank manager was lucky not to be jailed after admitting two drink-driving offences. Neighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Sherf John Montgomery told him: “That would normally mean a custodial sentence. I note your previously unblemished record.” The sherf instead imposed a fine of pound on Fairbairn, and banned him from driving for three years. Depute fiscal Lynda Carnochan described how an anonymous person phoned police on Tuesday afternoon, August , , around .pm. An hour later, police traced a blue Audi car to Rodney Drive in Girvan, and Fairbairn was still in the vehicle. His speech was slurred, said Ms Carnochan. But due to health problems, he struggled to give a breath test.   However, a blood test revealed he had  milligrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of blood, when the legal limit is  milligrammes. Just two months later, on October , , police on mobile patrol saw Fairbairn driving a Vauxhall Corsa. “They were aware of anonymous reports that he was driving while drinking,” said Ms Carnochan. “They followed him into The Avenue, but he did not stop when police flashed lights at him. He then turned into Rodney Drive, and drove past his own address. However he was eventually stopped.” A breath test was this time successful on Fairbairn. And iot showed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath when the legal limit is  microgrammes. Solicitor Hugh Duncan said Fairbairn had retired from the Bank of Scotland in  on a pension of pound per week.   He used his car to visit his -year-old mother, who is resident in a care home, added the lawyer. “The second matter, within such a short space of time, shows there is an issue with alcohol,” Mr Duncan admitted. “His we tells me his drinking is being curtailed. He was hospitalised with a gallstone, and he suffers from COPD.” Sherf Montgomery fined Fairbairn pound on the first charge, with a  months disqualication. He added an pound fine and a three-year disqualication on the second charge. Fairbairn, of Rodney Drive in Girvan, agreed to pay the pound total within  days. His disqualications will run concurrently, making a total of three years, but the Crown made no move to seize the family cars.

The board has certainly had a thorough look through it and as a matter of record we should appreciate it.#One thing that has caused frustration at previous meetings has been the dficulty in reading some of the financial papers.#This doesn’t change the overall picture, which is not a good one, but when you see it like this, it is easier.#The key things I take out will be the grip and control actions that the board are approving today.#As Kirsty says, this is not just a one-week wonder – this is a continuous process to help improve the financial position.#Although the outlook is not good there is a positive in that we have a better transparency and now that we have the grip and control we can look to move forward and see what dference it makes.#At the meeting, Ms Flanagan explained why an overspend is projected when the HSCP is currently operating at an underspend of just more than £,.The HSCP, run jointly by the council and NHS Highland, may face even further financial woean agreement is not reached with NHSGGC.Ms Flanagan said: #The finances within the dferent organisations are managed dferently. There is no right or wrong approach.#There has been a lower than budgeted demand for care home services. The focus of attention needs to be on the full year position, so reporting an overspend of £.m is a deterioration on where we were at our November meeting.#The main reason for this is dficulty in delivering over £m worth of savings. There also remains a risk to the out turn in the SLA with NHSGGC.#The board made the decision at the November meeting to reject the agreement and the overspend has been adjusted to reflect this.#If this position is not accepted by NHSGGC, the overspend could increase by up to £.m.#Cllr Mulvaney then proposed that a repayment plan from the HSCP to the council is deferred by a year.This involves the authority being repaid any loss made by the HSCP over a three-year period, with £, due in the first financial year, £, in the second financial year, and the balance in year three.Ms Flanagan said: #We should seek clarication but I think that would be a reasonable request.#It was also advised that a job description has been finalised for a permanent head of finance with the HSCP and should be advertised soon."},{"url":null,"title":"bus fare payments to go contactless","story":"Nearly half a million pounds has been awarded in the first round of the fund to help firms cope with the costs of upgrading ticket machines to accept contactless bank payments.The cash has been awarded from the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund.It is estimated to provide a contactless payment solution to potentially . million fare paying journeys right across Scotland.The fund builds on the successful rollout of contactless payment by the country’s largest operators and responds to feedback from smaller operators around the financial barriers to upgrading.The Scottish Government’s vision is that all journeys on Scotland’s public transport networks can be made using some form of smart ticketing or payment by spring .Commenting on the first awards, cabinet secretary for transport, Michael Matheson said: #Contactless payments make it easier to access travel in Scotland and I am delighted we have been able to support up to  smaller operators in making the transition to this convenient payment solution.#This government is committed to supporting the industry and also people right across the country who choose to travel by bus.#By helping smaller operators with the financial costs of upgrading to contactless payment, customers will benefit from quicker and easier transactions, whether by card or by mobile phone.#A second round of the fund hasl opened and we are widening this fund out to all operators, so that even more organisations can take advantage of the support on offer.#Keith Shand, Assistant Operations Manager at Garelochhead Mini Bus and Coaches, said: #Modern day society expects to board a bus and not have to carry the correct change.#Feedback from our customers shows  per cent have indicated they would use contactless payments on our buses and we’re delighted that we will now be able to deliver this service.#The Courier emailed West Coast Motors for a comment but no-one responded."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files february 8 2019","story":"Natasha turns up the heatAlthough narrowly beaten in the Highlands and Islands regional final, Natasha Lee impressed a  of hospitality judges in Inverness.The Campbeltown Grammar School pupil, aged , beat off stf competition to win a place at Inverness for the UK-wide Springboard FutureChef  cookery competition.Natasha with her certicate and regional finalist plate.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

He effectively dropped his opposition to her Withdrawal Agreement, which Labour had repeatedly condemned as the ldquoworst of all worlds. The Labour leaderrsquos letter still calls for a customs union, regulatory alignment on trade and guarantees on workers rights and security cooperation. But, crucially, Labour is no longer holding to the ldquosix tests, and insisting a Brexit deal should deliver ldquoexactly the same benefits as being in the single market.Labour has even dropped its opposition to the Irish backstop, which Mr Corbyn condemned, as recently as December, for leaving Britain ldquoin an indefinite halfway house with no say on its future. The explanatory note that Labour circulated after the leaderrsquos letter to May is quite clear. ldquoAny withdrawal agreement,\" it says, ldquowill need to include a backstop.\" Labour is also hinting at further compromises in ldquonegotiations.Hitherto, Labourrsquos policy has been to make demands May could never accept now they are trying to make her an offer she canrsquot refuse.So at last, after months of there being nothing much new to say about Brexit, suddenly we have what looks like a breakthrough, a historic compromise. Of course, you canrsquot overestimate the ability of political leaders to look a gt horse in the mouth. Theresa May may be so wedded to being a ldquobloody dficult womanthat she may find a way to avoid accepting Labourrsquos free hooved mammal. But the deal is there to be made.Senior Tories like Sir Oliver Letwin have welcomed the Labour offer, seeing it as a step towards a Norway-style agreement, even though it isnrsquot. Labourrsquos plan is much closer to Turkey, which is also in a customs union and accepts regulatory alignment. Brussels likes Corbyns proposals too, as a way out of hard Brexit ldquohell.Ive argued that the logic of Labourrsquos position was always to back something resembling Theresa Mayrsquos deal with the EU. It corresponds to Labourrsquos manesto commitments to leaving the EU, including the single market, and ending free movement while seeking frictionless trade. Mrs May has always supported regulatory alignment, since the ldquocommon rule book in her Chequers plan. And the backstop, remember, involves the UK remaining in the customs union until there is a future comprehensive trade deal.In what could almost have been a coordinated intervention last week, Mrs May restated in Dublin her determination to prevent a hard border in Ireland. This put the wind up the DUP, since they fear that the border might now move to the Irish Sea.It didnrsquot appeal to the hardline Brexiteers in her own party either, who are adamant that no deal is better than her bad deal. They thought it had been killed off by last monthrsquos record-breaking Commons defeat ndash but it may now live again with Labourrsquos backing.They canrsquot admit it, of course, but May and Corbyn are now speaking broadly the same language. The customs union, regulatory alignment, rights and protections etc are all matters to do with the future trade relationship with the EU, not the Withdrawal Agreement. It covers only money, citizenship and the Good Friday Agreement.The trading relationship can only be negotiated after Brexit. It is to be hammered out within the up to four years of the transition period, during which the UK remains in the single market and the customs union.Onlythere is no agreement does the backstop comes into play, and that really just extends the transition period indefinitely. May has said she will get assurances that the backstop will be time-limited, but she canrsquot get that from the European Union. If it was limited, it would no longer be a backstop.What hard Brexiteers really fear is that the transition period might lead to a soft Brexit, not a clean break ndash and they are right. What we know is that MPs will block any no-deal Brexit. Hardliners face a choice of May Corbyn or no Brexit at all.To secure a Commons majority without them, Mrs May could promise legislation to keep Britain in regulatory alignment with the customs union until a new trade deal is finalised ndash one which delivers the same benefits. This is anyway implicit in her promises to keep trade ldquofrictionless. Indeed, remaining in a customs union is the only way of achieving this. Up to now, she hasnrsquot been able to say this openly for fear of a rebellion by her hardline backbenchers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. They want a managed no-deal now, or in four years, under the so-called ldquoMalthouse Plan.Butshe has an ounce of political sense, May will now face them down and pivot to Labourrsquos softish Brexit. Labourrsquos demand that she put the customs union in primary legislation can be finessed, because the trade negotiations canrsquot happen until after Brexit. She doesnrsquot even need to ensure that Labour votes with her. Labour could abstain in the meaningful vote and achieve essentially the same result. The DUP would accept the customs union as a guarantee against a backstop or an east west hard border.Jeremy Corbyn could explain Labourrsquos abstention, which will be attacked by Vote Leave MPs andleader writers, by saying, as his spokespeople did last week: that the top priority ldquofor the nation is to avoid a no-deal. Corbynite commentators can be relied upon to condemn any Labour MPs who continue to vote against Mayrsquos deal as traitors. Unreconstructed Blairites, voting with the hated Moggists to force a no-deal disaster.Corbynrsquos letter made no reference to a Peoples Vote. Remainers in the Labour Party realise where all this is heading, which is why a number, like former shadow cabinet figures like Owen Smith, and Clive Lewis, have threatened to leave the party. That could become part of the script.Corbyn has used the Brexit issue to smoke out Blairite Remainers like Chuka Umunna, and the Jewish MP, Luciana Berger, in order to portray them as disloyal splitters.Of course, ordinary members of the Labour Party will be mightily confused. Many of them still think Labour is committed to a referendum. It still could come to that, of course,May doesnrsquot seize this opportunity.I still harbour vague hopes that A could be revoked, but Irsquom afraid that pro-Europeans are on the wrong side of history right now. The country is destined to leave the EU, because letrsquos face it, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is and has always been a pro-Brexit party.And after Brexit Day  Well, get ready for Groundhog Day  as negotiations over the future EU trade deal begin all over again."},{"url":null,"title":"business-diary-of-nicola-sturgeons-top-aide-records-gym-class-but-not-alex-salmond-meeting","story":"Official logs show Liz Lloyd enjoyed an early morning fitness class on April , while a work catch-up meeting scheduled for later that afternoon was cancelled.But the diary, released under Freedom of Information, makes no mention of a meeting between Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon at the latterrsquos house in Glasgow that same day, despite Ms Lloyd also being present.:Calls for public inquiry into \"unlawful\" handling of sexual misconduct complaints against Alex SalmondIt was during this meeting that Mr Salmond first told his successor he was being investigated by the Scottish Government amid allegations of sexual harassment.A spokesman for the Scottish Tories said: ldquoPeople will certainly have questions to ask about the diary of a senior taxpayer-funded Scottish Government employee.ldquoThe SNP Government does not have to wait for the Holyrood investigation, and could clary exactly what this member of staff was doing on these days, and why.Entries in Ms Lloydrsquos business diary covering the dates of phone calls and meetings between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond were released following an FoI request.It comes amid intense scrutiny of the contacts, during which Mr Salmond brought up a Government investigation into sexual harassment allegations against him.:Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond at war over poundk legal caseThe meetings are set to be probed by MSPs after questions were raised over Ms Sturgeonrsquos involvement and her initial decision not to report the contact.

This political correctness did not long survive the vote, and not one on the  a few weeks later corrected an audience member who referred to \"English industry and trade\".Having watched the decline in standards over the past  months, I have decided not to waste my time watching Question Time. If I want to hear a reasoned and intelligent political discussion, I will ask a group of teenagers their opinion.T J Dowds,q Fleming Road, Cumbernauld.I NOTE with interest Mark Smiths article. I have thought for some time that Question Time has lost its way and that we no longer are presented with considered debate from reasonably informed members of the public. It seems to be a perpetual shouting joust from hand-picked members of the public. Last weeks episode was the prime example, no proper debate. I find now, and have done for some time, that I can only tolerate about half the programme before retiring with a good work of fiction.On Thursday evening the five members of the audience who were invited to participate, before I switched off and went to bed, were all vehemently opposed to the SNP, including as Mr Smith pointed, out one who was a Ukip member of the Orange Lodge, entitled to his opinion, however unchallenged in the \"debate\".In his last few years I felt David Dimbleby had lost control and Fiona Bruce, his replacement, whom I admire as a newsreader and presenter, lacks the incisive qualities of, for example, Emily Maitlis, who has proved on Newsnight she has the ability.The same  participants also seem to appear every few weeks asthe BBC has a limited pool of participants. Time for the BBC to review where this once-great programme is heading, or has the Brexit issue finally brought it to the point of no recovery Wallace Milligan, Juniper Green, Masonhill, Ayr.MARK Smithrsquos assessment of the BBCrsquos Question Time in Motherwell was charitable indeed. He gives the BBC the benefit of the doubt after allowing a known Ukip activist his fourth opportunity to shout at the SNP on the programme. This love-in between the BBC and Ukip has been longstanding, given the number of appearances Nigel Farage has had on the programme in recent years.The continued and sustained lack of SNP politicians appearing despite being the third largest party at Westminster compares badly with the treatment of the Liberal Democrats when they were in an identical parliamentary position. The truth is that the BBC has failed in its service to Scotland. The pound million Scotlandrsquos licence fee payers send south should instead be used to fund a new BBC Scotland, with complete editorial independence from the BBC in London. Before anyone complains that this would provide a poor service given a budget of this size, please be aware that Irelandrsquos BBC, which is known as RTE, spent eurom Ein .The New BBC Scotland would have at least the same spending power as RTE.Francis Buchan, Drybrough Crescent, Edinburgh.LAST Thursday on BBC Question Time from Motherwell, a serial audience member, former Ukip candidate Billy Mitchell, popped up in his favourite orange jerkin for his fourth appearance in so many years. This is a breach of the QT rules. A stooshie ensued on social media. Was he a far right plant by a Unionist-leaning editorial team, or had he sneaked in because of a flawed vetting procedure  I made it clear I thought cock-up, not conspiracy was the answer.That didnrsquot stop Mark Smith weighing in yesterday, writing a piece in which he described my position ndash that is, rejecting a conspiracy ndash as ldquocrappy, conspiratorial Da Vinci Code thinking. I know, surreal.Mr Smith also had an eccentric take on Mr Mitchellrsquos choice of orange jacket it was no more signicant than SNP list Fiona Hysloprsquos blue jacket. However a wee bit of googling would have alerted him to the fact that Mr Mitchell is a supporter of Ulster Young Militants, and calls himself \"orange jacket man\" on Facebook. So I donrsquot think itrsquos unreasonable to assume that his choice of jacket was a self-conscious sartorial nod.Why does it all matter  Well because Question Time producers say they have clear rules be up front about who you are when you apply to be on the programme, no repeat audience appearances, and politicians arenrsquot allowed to take cover in the audience ndash their place is on the  where they can be identied and their views subjected to scrutiny. Thatrsquos something surely we can all agree on John Nicolson,Presenter, TalkRadio, Hatfields, LondonAS they always do when theyre found out, Nationalists are claiming the Question Time audience was rigged and looking for dirt on Billy Mitchell.

Although Shetland tells a single story over six hours, a long time in TV drama, it barely draws breath, throwing in one twist after another, and many an ldquoissue besides, without ever seeming heavy-handed. This series looks like it will be shining a light in some very dark corners, including racism and misogyny.It would be hard going, and it sometimes is, without the company of Perez and his team, especially Sergeant Billy, ing as a one man Greek chorus, announcing the next woe to come along.

Sometimes you should be honest with yourself, never mind being honest with the people of the United Kingdom.As the Tory benches expressed their disapproval at his tone, Mr Blackford continued, accusing the PM of living in a ldquoBrexit fantasy.ldquoWe are  days from Scotland being dragged out of the European Union against our will,  days from economic catastrophe, he declared.Branding her deal a ldquofraud, and calling on her to extend the Article  process, the Highland MP questioned whether the Government had undertaken an economic impact analysis on her deal.When Mrs May rose to insist such an analysis had been published, Mr Blackford shouted out: ldquoNot true.After John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, intervened to insist the PM must be heard, she suggested by his interruption the SNP leader might have ldquoinadvertently misled the House.At this point, Mr Blackford shouted out: ldquoLiar.As Tory MPs reacted angrily and pointed their fingers at the Nationalist MP, Mr Bercow rose to ldquoask the right honourable gentleman to withdraw that word. He cannot accuse another Member in this House of dishonesty.

These questions are serious and they need proper consideration and scrutiny.He said the BBCrsquos provision of news coverage online for free was making it dficult for news publishers to sell content and subscriptions, and could be undermining funding for journalism as a result. ldquoNobody argues that the BBCrsquos content is not good, butit is always free it is dficult for commercial publishers to establish a sound basis to operate, he said. ldquoThe BBC, funded by the licence-payer, has been abusing its monopoly.Mr McLellan said the BBC was operating in areas, including long-form written journalism which was nothing to do with its core role. A lot of the written material it produces is in direct competition with commercial news providers and is not part of its coreas a public service broadcaster. Much of the material the BBC is publishing now is independent of their programming. You see it in sport every weekend, he said.ldquoThere are many factors affecting us in publishing and the BBCrsquos online operation is only one of them. Changing that itself is not going to change the basic issue of the monopolising of advertising revenues by the tech giants, but it doesnrsquot help us when we are trying to construct viable alternatives.The Shawcross report does not make a judgement about the extent to which the BBCrsquos online coverage is harming the press. But the review ldquourges the BBC to think more carefully about how its news provision can act as a complement to, rather than a substitute for commercial news.Meanwhile, it adds: ldquoOfcom should assess whether BBC News Online is striking the right balance between aiming for the widest reach for its own content on the one hand and driving traffic from its online site to commercial publisherson the other, and says ldquothe BBC should do more to share its technical and digital expertise for the benefit of local publishers.Critics have questioned to what extent news coverage of TV lsquoeventsrsquo like Love Island and Irsquom a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here should be a part of its role as a public service broadcaster, but the BBC argues a erse spread of material is essential in order to reach all audiences, particularly young people.The BBC also funds Local Democracy Reporters under a scheme which provides publishers with reporters to enhance coverage of councils and other local issues. The review calls for an expansion of the scheme. However it has been dficult to recruit candidates in some areas. Mr McLellan welcomed this suggestion and said the principle had been established but added: ldquoThe strengths of the programme now need to be built on and the weaknesses tackled.In response to the review the Culture secretary Jeremy Right said:The BBC offers the very thing that this Review aims to encourage: a source of reliable and high quality news, with a focus on objectivity and impartiality, and independent from government. However, it is right that the role of the BBC, as a Public Service Broadcaster, is appropriately transparent and clear.A spokesman for the BBC said there was no evidence of the BBC ldquocrowding out other providers. ldquoItrsquos vital that people of all ages have access to impartial news which is relevant to them, and we provide younger audiences with a wide range of stories, he said. ldquo Wersquore happy to look at what more we can do to share our technical and digital expertise for the benefit of local publishers, but as the review itself says, any curtailing of the BBCrsquos news offering would be counter-productive."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-theresa-may-accused-of-showing-contempt-for-democracy","story":"When an international treaty - like the proposed Withdrawal Agreement with the EU - is signed, by law MPs should have  days to scrutinise its details before it is implemented.But the Prime Minister told MPs that they already knew the details of the Withdrawal Agreement, only a few of which, relating to the backstop, she was seeking to change.Therefore, the  days of scrutiny were not needed and the Government would seek to scrap the provision in this instance through the Withdrawal Agreement Bill once a new deal with Brussels had been struck.Mrs May explained: \"While we will follow normal procedurewe can, where there is insufficient time remaining after the meaningful vote, we will make provision in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, with Parliaments consent, to ensure we are able to raty on time to guarantee our exit in an orderly way.\"However, for many MPs this reference to ldquoinsufficient time raised the prospect that the PM will seek to hold the meaningful vote on her Plan B just days before exit day on March .\"This plan shows contempt for our democracy, declared Labourrsquos Paul Blomfield. ldquoThe Government is trying to avoid proper scrutiny and run down the clock in order to force through its bad Brexit deal Labour will oppose this change, which would deny Parliament full scrutiny.\"Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP, speaking on behalf of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, accused Mrs May of a ldquocynical and undemocratic move, adding: \"May will stop at nothing to crowbar through her botched Brexit deal eventhat means ripping up the Statute Book and subverting parliamentary scrutiny and process.Just hours after yet another Commons statement on the EU withdrawal process, Labour began its bid to stop the PM from ldquorecklessly running down the clock a claim she denied.Jeremy Corbyn tabled an amendment for tomorrowrsquos debate and vote on Brexit aimed at forcing Mrs May to hold a meaningful vote by the end of the month.ldquoThis amendment would stop the Government from running down the clock on the Brexit negotiations, hoping MPs can be blackmailed into supporting a botched deal. This is an act of gross irresponsibility, declared the Labour leader.However, the expectation is that this amendment will fail and so-called ldquoHigh Noon will take place with the third indicative vote, due on February .Yesterday evening, Labourrsquos Yvette Cooper published a new bill to force a decision by mid-March to avoid Britain crashing out of the EU on March  without a deal.The Yorkshire MP will put forward her amendment for debate and a vote on February  when some ministers, including a number in the Cabinet, might be prepared to resign rather than be part of a government that was allowing Britain to plunge over the Brexit clf-edge. Early indications are that Ms Cooper could expect more Tory support than her unsuccessful effort last month.She said: \"This bill creates a parliamentary safeguard to prevent us drting into no-deal by accident and to prevent those crucial decisions being left until the final fortnight.\"Yesterday during the PMrsquos update to MPs, Mr Corbyn made a direct appeal to Cabinet ministers to rebel to stop a no-deal outcome.He said: ldquoNo minister, serious about protecting jobs in this country, would allow a prime minister to deliberately run down the clock and play chicken with peoples livelihoods. To stand by and do nothing would be a complete dereliction of duty.\"Earlier, Mrs May called on MPs to \"hold their nerve\" and come together behind an EU withdrawal deal which would deliver Brexit on schedule in  daysrsquo time.She insisted she believed the Government could get the necessary changes to the backstop and honour the referendum result in full to ldquoset this country on course for the bright future that every part of this United Kingdom deserves.She added: ldquoThat is this Governments mission.

as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution.

This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime. This offers a unique perspective that can show just what preventative measures can be taken to outsmart these online criminals.”To learn more about the Cyber Sense on Tour event and to book a free place, visit www.hellodigital.scot cyber-sense- copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials.

But after holding the first AGM last week, the group now wants to go after larger projects through the lottery funding.The ultimate ambition is to renovate Dingwall Town Hall and ensure it is brought into regular and sustained use by locals and visitors as a focal point of the town.Before that, the DCDC directors and trustees, comprising Janet Bowen, Debbie Downie, Robin Lingard and Nigel Greenwood have been ldquosting through the communityrsquos suggestions for improvements to the town.Mrs Bowen said: ldquoDingwall is very fortunate to have a number of organisations which are dedicated to making the town an attractive and welcoming place. But we want to use our charitable status to unlock funding for capital projects which should make a signicant dference in raising Dingwallrsquos profile.The first of those projects out of the traps has been developed with the help of the Dingwall History Society and is a heritage trail around the town which stops off at around a dozen sites.Among them are the memorial next to the train station, the birthplace of MacBeth ndash Dingwall Castle, as well as the Macdonald Monument and others.Mrs Bowen said: ldquoUsing a series of display  to highlight to both local people and visitors the richness of Dingwallrsquos history, especially as a Viking settlement.A sticking point however is that the bridge over the Dingwall canal is closed due to safety concerns.ldquoThe big issue here, of course, is the future of the footbridge across the Dingwall canal, which has been out of use for some time now because of safety fears. The community council is very anxious to bring it back into use and we are looking at what role we might play in helping to bring it back into use.Many local groups feel that Dingwallrsquos Viking heritage has been a little neglected but in  archaeologists and historians managed to flesh out the legends.

Highland Council has not asked the Scottish Government for support in relation to St Clementrsquos.Christyna Ferguson, whose daughter suffering a series of complex health issues including autism attends the school, slammed the councilrsquos inaction \"utter contempt for the already disadvantaged, vulnerable children\".She said: \"The Highland Council repeatedly told us that St.Clementrsquos appalling lack of facilities was due to a lack of Scottish government funding. Therefore it is misleading at best and shows not only non-compliance with their statuary obligations but utter contempt for the children.\"In the last year the Highland Council has taken no action to survey sites, secure funding or build a business plan despite assuring us they would.\"She insisted: ldquoHighland Council does have options in terms of funding solutions but they repeatedly refuse to engage in the process ndash again failing in their statutory obligations and causing unnecessary suffering and detriment to disabled children. It is incomprehensible to me that those with the power and the obligation in law can show such blatant disregard for disabled children.\"Dingwall-based MSP Kate Forbes said: \"As the daughter of a former teacher at St Clementrsquos, I am in no doubt as to the poor condition of the buildings. It is remarkable the teachers are able to care for and teach the pupils in such a damp, cramped building.ldquoThere is a desperate need for a new building, delivered in consultation with parents and teachers. This is, of course, a matter for Highland Council who are statutorily responsible for school buildings but I think everybody wants to see a solution.\"I am more than happy to work with anybody and everybody to find a solution and would sincerely hope that wersquore not still talking about school buildings in another  years.\"Childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd, also a Ross-shire-based SNP MSP, said: \"The school has not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans despite being in a poor condition.\"Itrsquos nearly a year since I first raised concerns with the council so I look forward to meeting with councillors and officers at the end of this month to hear an update on progress.

That is why it is vital that we can find the right solution for the pupils, parents and the wider St Clementrsquos community.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"At this point in time we are addressing our capital plan for next year and the process is still ongoing.

A petition attracted , signatures and  music experts wrote to the council voicing their dismay.Announcing the cut would not go ahead, Labour council leader Derek Milligan told yesterday’s meeting: “We have heard loud and clear from youngsters the value they place on this.”The decision was immediately welcomed. Singer-songwriter Karine Polwart tweeted: “If you’re feeling like protest makes no dference, this morning Midlothian Council axed plans to axe music and expressive arts from my local schools in response to overwhelming beautul noisy protest.”And EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan said: “The high number of parents and pupils who turned out in support of the demonstration today shows the strength of feeling in the Midlothian community, and its belief that all children should have access to music tuition.“Learning music benefits young people in terms of their self-confidence and in their ability to work independently or as part of a larger group.”Music tuition was one of araft of proposed cuts to council services and facilities were rejected by councillors as they approved the   budget.But they agreed a council tax rise of . per cent - the maximum allowed by the Scottish Government - to raise an extra £.m.

For some years, councillors have had to make some increasingly hard choices, but now they will think twice about silencing the music in Scotland’s schools.But it is also a lesson that democracy does work.We vote for people to represent us but the ‘will of the people’ does not stop being expressed after election day, it is a continuous process.

MPs would then decide how to proceed. However, without support from Tory MPs, the amendment is unlikely to pass.There were angry scenes in the Commons as the SNP’s Westminster leader came within moments of a second expulsion from the chamber in under a year after he called the Prime Minister a “liar”.Facing growing demands to delay Brexit by extending Article  to avoid a no-deal scenario, the Prime Minister urged MPs to “hold their nerve” and deliver Brexit on time. Mrs May confirmed that there would be another round of votes on Brexit at the end of February, but offered no guarantee that a substantive ‘meaningful vote’ on a deal would take place by then.After opening the door to talks with Jeremy Corbyn on a compromise proposal that could get the deal through the Commons, she struck a harder tone yesterday, ruling out a permanent customs union and urging the Labour leader to support her plan.Mrs May acknowledged she would need “some time” to seek legally-binding changes from the EU to the controversial ‘backstop’ provision for the Irish border. She confirmed that she will table an amendable motion for debate on Thursday, seeking the House’s continued support for her to demand “alternative arrangements” to keep the border open after Brexit.And she pledged toon February  with a further statement – triggering another debate and votes the following day –she has not secured a deal by that date.The votes on  February votes are expected to come shortly after a planned meeting between Mrs May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Their encounter would represent one of the final opportunities to extract concessions from the EU, which hosts its final heads-of-government summit before Brexit in the third week of March.Last night Labour tabled an amendment to be voted on tomorrow that would force the government to declare “that there is no longer an agreement in principle”no deal had been reached by  February.A cross-party group of MPs opposing a no-deal Brexit last night said they would not allow “endless drt”, and would force a vote on legislation to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU on  February.“The Prime Minister needs to get a workable deal in place quickly and she has asked for more time,” Labour MP Yvette Cooper said. “But there is a real danger of endless drt soshe can’t get a deal in place by  February, our cross party group will put forward this bill at that point to ensure that crucial decisions are made by the middle of March.”The Conservative MP Oliver Letwin added: “Any MP who genuinely wants to prevent an under-prepared no deal Brexit will need to vote for this bill at the end of February.“It is the only way of giving the House of Commons the time to produce a consensus about a positive way forwardthe PM cannot get her deal through by mid-March”.Last night ITV News reported that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on negotiations with the EU, told Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay that MPs faced a choice between Mrs May’s deal or extending Article . With  days to go, former attorney general Dominic Grieve warned that time was running perilously short for ratication of any deal under the terms of the  Constitutional Reform and Governance Act, which requires  sitting days before the ratication of any international treaty.But Mrs May responded:“In most circumstances, that period may be important in order for this House to have an opportunity to study that agreement.“In this instance MPs will already have debated and approved the agreement as part of the meaningful vote.”The Prime Minister’s official spokesman told journalists that by the time the -day period to consider the Brexit treaty kicked in, MPs would already have passed judgment on it in the “meaningful vote” and the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.The process would be accelerated by a clause in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill itself, which would ‘disapply’ the terms of the  Act in this case, he said.In the Commons, the Labour leader claimed the PM was “running down the clock” on Brexit in the hope that MPs will be “blackmailed” by the fear of a no-deal outcome into supporting “a deeply flawed deal”.The Prime Minister was heckled as she denied running down the clock, telling Mr Corbyn that she had “wanted to have this sorted before Christmas”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"majority back regulation of social media networks","story":"The vast majority of adults in Scotland would back regulation of social media networks, according to a new survey.Of the  Scottish adults polled for child protection charity the NSPCC,  per cent supported statutory regulation, while  per cent disagreed that networks do enough to protect children from sexual grooming.It comes as part of a wider survey that found nine in ten adults across the whole of Britain also supported the idea of regulation.The charity’s latest campaign, Taming The Wild West Web, is calling for the introduction of a “robust independent regulator” to force social networks to protect children using their s.Ruth Moss, of Edinburgh, whose daughter Sophie took her own le at the age of , is backing the campaign.Ms Moss described how it felt after finding out her teenager had looked at self-harm and suicide content on social media.She said: “Sophie’s death devastated me.

The aim is to encourage conversation and share experiences and knowledge about their own encounters with nature.Suzy Lee, ATLASArts film programmer, commented: “We are really excited about working with both Portree Primary and Budhmor House to offer this screening that encourages sharing and discussion.We’ve had a great response to the film and to our extended programme, so we look forward to showing the film in a new environment.”Centre with the primary seven girls from Portree Primary.Angus Beaton, a care worker at the centre praised the event for bridging the generational gap.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GAMEKEEPER-SCOTT-MACKENZIE-2.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

Nowadays even the most hard to wake sleepers have bleepers, bells and even the dulcet tones of Alexa at their bedside to ensure they get up for work in time.But in times gone by, it wasn’t just a case of a verbal shot across the bows from the bossyou turned up late for work - back in the so-called ‘good old days’ it could mean the loss of a day’s pay or maybe even your job. And back in the hungry s when every day was a grind to put the most basic grub on the table and keep a roof over your head, it was women like the lady opposite who you relied on to get you to your work on time.Our pictures show one of the last of the ‘knocker-uppers’ who rose well before the crack of dawn every day in le to go round the doors to give people their morning alarm call.Known as ‘The Lady With The Map’, Mary Millar plied her trade in Kells and Connor.A knocker-up was a job in Britain and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution, when alarm clocks were neither cheap nor reliable.Most had given up the role by the begnning of the s but Mary was still performing her morning task up until the outbreak of World War .  The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillationwithin  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Ambulance response times to cardiac arrests are typically longer than this, as in Northern Ireland they average  minutes. Andthis is why communities across the Northern Ireland have formed these community first responder schemes.Volunteers are trained, and dispatched at the same time as the responding ambulance crew, by NIAS.The Braid Valley is now joining this movement.Leonard Wharry, the scheme coordinator, explained: We aim to go live in early summer with a scheme covering Ballymena, Broughshane and the surrounding rural areas.Were raising money for defibrillators and other equipment, but our priority is to recruit and train volunteers. People who live and work locally, who can make themselves available to respond and who meet our other requirements.”If you are interested in finding out more about the Braid Valley Community First Responder Scheme, the scheme organisers, NIAS and Dalriada Urgent Care are hosting an open evening at  pm on Wednesday February  at:NIAS North Division HQ –  Antrim RoadBallymena.

In  an offer was put in to purchase the former pub, and in September last year they finally moved in to the charity’s new home and began renovations to turn the building into a community facility.

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.To move or not to move  That is the Brexit question Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project. We have a team here that have a passion to serve this community, to walk in unity with them and see change happen.”• About the charity and its work...Founded in  by Gail Redmond, Via Wings was set up to help people in need in Dromore and surrounding areas.The faith-based charity’s aim “is to show God’s love in a loving, caring, practical, non-judgemental way.”It runs a range of projects designed to tackle problems such as poverty, loneliness, isolation, deprivation and more.

Ballymurphy Massacre spokesperson John Teggart told Daily Belfast that he and other family members will take the delegation on a tour of the Springfield Road todayto show them the exact areas were their loved ones were shot and killed.“The AOH gave us great strength going into court on Monday,” explained John. “Support such as this gives the families great heart and it is really encouraging to see that level of support for our campaign coming from America.“We will be giving the group a tour of the Springfield Road area to show them where exactly our loved ones fell. They will be standing in the spots where they were murdered.“This is a very signicant week as the inquest will hear from Bobby Clarke who was shot and wounded.

It would take a great team to beat his Naomh Éanna side in Championship football this season. On Saturday night, they went toe-to-toe with a fine Kilcummin outfit and came off second best as the Kerry men ran out emphatic -point victors.Central to Kilcummin’s success was the scintillating performance of Kevin McCarthy # who scored a remarkable -, all from play.As his team made their way off the pitch to a remarkable ovation from their large travelling support, the Naomh Éanna boss praised their efforts after a long season which still yielded two Championship titles.“We said coming down here we could live with playing our best and getting beat by a better team. I don’t think we played our best, but we were beaten by a better team,” said Fitzsimons.“Their goalkeeperpulled off two or three great saves and you need to be getting those scores at this level.“They are a super team. I said to the boys at half-time that we were still on the bus. This is a very young side # Eoin Nagle is only  and he was as good as anyone.“There is a bright future in front of those boysthey all stick together and continue to work the way they have been.”In truth, the North Belfast men never really recovered from a nightmare start which saw them concede - inside the first eight minutes with Matt Keane and McCarthy finding the target.A stunning goal from Eoin Nagle kick-started Naomh Éanna’s challenge following a couple of good points from Odhran Eastwood and a Ruairi Scott major on  minutes left just two points between the sides.However, their good work was swtly undone at the other end in a counter attack which halted their progress.Goalkeeper Paddy Flood fouled Noel Duggan as the corner-forward was bearing down on goal following a great pass inside from Seán O’Leary. Referee James Molloy awarded the penalty and issued a black card to Flood for the take-down.To add insult to injury, defender Conor McAuley picked up an ankle ligament injury in the goalmouth scramble which ended his evening.With substitute ’keeper Conor Devlin unavailable due to his soccer commitments with Larne, Michael Morgan donned the number one jersey for the remainder of the contest, but, following a y stoppage, he couldn’t prevent Kieran Murphy from scoring the penalty.With Kilcummin moving into a - to - lead at the break, the Antrim and Ulster champions needed a fast start to the second half, yet an unanswered salvo of - put the game firmly beyond Naomh Éanna. Former Kerry goalkeeper Brendan Kealy pulled off a smart save to deny Kristian Healy early in the half, but current Kingdom ist McCarthy stole the show with some majestic scores.He dovetailed well with the industrious Noel Duggan while Murphy and centre-back Chris O’Leary pushed forward with abandon. As Naomh Éanna continued to chase the game, their defence was exposed.When Healy tested Kealy’s reflexes once again midway through the half, Kilcummin went straight down to the Davin Stand side and with McCarthy splitting the posts in ruthless fashion.With less than  minutes remaining, Kilcummin bagged their fourth major with McCarthy applying the finish following a wonderful move involving Shane McSweeey and Gary O’Leary with McCarthy turning past the advancing Morgan in the Naomh Éanna goal before driving the ball into the net.In injury-time, he completed his hat-trick with his easiest finish of the night after being left unmarked in front of goal to round off a brilliant inidual display.It wasn’t to be for Naomh Éanna, but they’ll quickly turn their attentions to the new season and tonight’s Antrim Championship draws when they will learn who there opponents will be when they make their Senior Football Championship debut later this year.

Thats around £m more than the previous year and equates to £, for each driver .The jams cost UK drivers £.bn in .Overall, Belfast was ranked as the th most congested city in the UK.Despite this, the total time lost sitting in traffic here decreased by % compared with the previous year, according to researchers.The study also revealed that Belfasts inner city last-mile travel speed was mph, while its last-mile travel time was seven minutes. Roads expert Wesley Johnston agreed that Belfasts congestion was \"bad\" and said it was one legacy of the Troubles.\"We know Belfast is a very car-dependent city, in part because of the Troubles, which encouraged people to fly out to the suburbs, more so than in other UK cities, and also discouraged people from using public transport,\" he said.\"Were not that big a city, really. We do have a unique past, which has accentuated this problem. Commuting is much more of a thing here. Plus we have had a car-focused transportation policy up until about the millennium.\"But Mr Johnston said he believed that steps were being taken in the right direction to address the issue.\"Two of them are the introduction of more cycle ways and initiatives like the Glider,\" he said.\"Neither of those are perfect, but I think its the only real solution. The only other way to solve this problem is to widen the roads going into the city centre, and you would be talking large scale demolition to do that. Theres no car-based solution to this problem - the answer has to lie in other forms of transport.\"Responding to the report, Institute of Civil Engineersregional director Richard Kirk said it \"will come as no surprise to Northern Ireland commuters\".\"We are an extremely car-dependent country, and our transport networks are already stretched to capacity,\" Mr Kirk said.\"We need to invest in our infrastructure to make it resilient, efficient and safe for users.\"We also need delivery of key projects like Belfast Rapid Transit Phase  and the York Street Interchange, which will greatly aid the flow of traffic within and around Belfast.\"Mr Kirk said the only way to meaningfully reduce congestion is through better provision and investment in public and active transport, adding that services such as the Glider are key to changing behaviour.\"As long as the majority of people choose personal cars over public transport, park and ride, walking or cycling, congestion will remain an economic, environmental and social issue,\" he added.South Belfast Green Party representative Aine Groogan said that, in addition to creating annoyance, congestion costs money and affects health. \"Congestion causes air pollution which contributes to  deaths per year across Northern Ireland from respiratory illnesses,\" she said.\"There are too many car parking spaces in central Belfast and we havent invested enough in modern public transport provision. We know that people will use public transport when it is provided, as demonstrated by the new Glider system.\"The Green Party is pushing the case for a green transport plan for Belfast which improves the health and well-being of all our citizens.\"The Department for Infrastructure said congestion in Belfast \"reflects the fact that too many of us are making the journey to and from work by car, usually alone with no one  in the vehicle\".\"This is not sustainable, it has signicant economic costs but also contributes to high emissions and poor air quality. Building more roads on its own will not address the problem but only add to it,\" it said.\"We need to increase the numbers travelling by public transport and walking and cycling for short journeys, and recognise there is no alternativeBelfast is to grow and be a great place to live and work.\""},{"url":null,"title":"famous faces out in force to help dame mary peters race to 1m for future","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Born in Sheffield, he earned  caps for his country, claiming League Cup glory with Stoke and Leicester.Renowned for his ability to make wonder saves, his finest came in the  World Cup finals, where he famously denied Brazil star Pele.Banks was also involved in the famous goal that never was a year later at Windsor Park when Northern Ireland hero George Best flicked the ball over the goalkeeper as he was preparing to kick it upfield. Best then headed the ball into the net. The referee disallowed the goal much to Gordons relief and Georges dismay, though they laughed about the incident later when they played for Fort Lauderdale Strikers in America.Former Manchester United star Gregg and Banks were team-mates at The Potters in . The pair got on so well that Banks gave Gregg one of his treasured World Cup shirts, which is now framed in Harrys house.\"Gordon and I were good friends and I was very sad to hear about his passing,\" said Gregg. \"We were team-mates at Stoke for a brief spell and I found Gordon to be a down to earth bloke who was popular with all the lads. I was very fond of him as a person, and as a goalkeeper he has to go down as one of the best.\"Gordon wasnt the biggest goalkeeper but in the era we played you had to be able to take care of yourself with challenges coming in and he could do that.\"He was also a fantastic shot stopper and exceptionally agile with a very good pair of hands.\"Gordon gave me one of his shirts from the World Cup and it is framed and hanging in my hall. It means a lot to me and the fact that Gordon and I were friends means most to me of all.\"Fellow Northern Ireland goalkeeping great Pat Jennings was also full of praise for Banks, who was named Fa goalkeeper of the year six times.\"He set the standard for goalkeepers and was the greatest of all. Every goalkeeper wanted to be like Gordon when he played. You could learn so much by watching him,\" he said.Ex-Northern Ireland midfielder Tommy Cassidy made his international debut the day Best netted that goal against Banks.\"It was typical George when he clipped the ball away from Gordon to score what we thought was a good goal only for the referee to disallow it,\" he said. \"Its brilliant now when you think about those two icons of the game being involved in that famous moment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"may must stand firm against to prevent brexit border in irish sea says dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She promised them a final vote on her Brexit deal.The Prime Minister confirmed she will table an amendable motion for debate tomorrow seeking the House of Commons continued support for her to demand \"alternative arrangements\" to keep the Irish border open after Brexit. And she pledged toon February  with a further statement - triggering another debate and votes the next day -she has not got a deal by then.The Prime Minister denied claims by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn that she was attempting to run the clock down to bounce MPs into supporting her deal.She said she was discussing several options with the EU to secure changes to the backstop, including replacing it with \"alternative arrangements\", placing a time limit on it and a unilateral exit clause.In response to Mrs Mays statement to MPs, Mr Dodds said: \"The Prime Minister has spoken about the need to keep a seamless border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after the UK exits the EU. \"I dont want any new barriers either, but equally Mrs May must remember the importance of stopping any new borders being erected between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\"Our most important market is the rest of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland trades more with Great Britain than with the Republic of Ireland, rest of the EU and the rest of the world combined.\"The DUP deputy leader said that Dublin had been \"incredibly vocal\" about the need for the backstop and in its support for the withdrawal agreement.\"Yet it is their attachment to this flawed draft deal which could lead to no deal being in place by the time the UK exits the EU,\" he said.\"Ultimately, it is not necessary to erect any new barriers either north-south or east-west. We can reach a better way forward, but it will require greater flexibility in Dublin and Brussels.\"Mr Dodds said the backstop had been rejected by Parliament.\"The Prime Minister received a clear mandate. The Government must now stand firm and deliver on the commitments made in that debate,\" he added.Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann, who is in London for talks with all the Westminster parties, said he hoped that the Prime Ministers actions matched her words. \"It would be the worst of all worlds,at the end of discussions with the EU, the only options on the table are no-deal or her original withdrawal agreement. Well be back to square one,\" he said. \"The backstop is totally unacceptable, as it would destroy the very foundations of the Belfast Agreement. \"The economic and constitutional integrity of the UK is not up for sale. This is the message that should be at the forefront of her thoughts in the days ahead as she attempts to make the EU see sense. \"Belligerence and grandstanding needs to be replaced by pragmatism and a dose of common sense.\"TUV leader Jim Allister said Mrs May was clearly playing for time and he warned her thatshe got nothing from \"belligerent Brussels\" she shouldnt try to bounce through the same deal that Parliament rejected.If she did, \"vigorous resistance\" would be needed from DUP MPs, he said. If the EU continued to \"humiliate her by offering nothing\", Mrs May needed to \"reclaim her dignity and lead us out on World Tradeterms on March \".Mr Allister said: \"One mooted suggestion, which the Prime Minister seems favourable to, namely, an end date to the backstop, is not a solution for Northern Ireland.\"It is wholly incompatible with the Unionthat date would become the new target date for Sinn Feins campaign for a referendum on Irish unication. Thus, far from bringing stability, such an arrangement would feed republican agitation. So, the backstop has to go now lock, stock and barrel.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry accused the Prime Minister and Parliament of \"wasting time\" by running the clock down on Brexit. They are playing a \"dangerous game\", he claimed. \"The choices facing the UK are clear and stark. Any negotiated Brexit will need to be based on this withdrawal agreement, including the backstop as it is currently framed,\" he said.\"The only coherent alternative is a further referendum. Otherwise, the default is a catastrophic no-deal situation. More and more delay and procrastination only serves to indulge delusions and the chasing of unicorns.\"Dr Farry said it seemed there was a Commons majority for a soft Brexit and there may be one for a second referendum."},{"url":null,"title":"mps launch fresh plan to avoid brexit nodeal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The move comes as it was reported the Prime Ministers chief EU adviser Olly Robbins has suggested MPs could be faced with a choice between accepting her deal or seeing Britains withdrawal put on hold for an extended period. ITV news reported that Mr Robbins was overheard in a Brussels hotel bar on Monday telling colleagues the EU would probably give the Government an extension to the Article  withdrawal process. He was said to have indicated thatMPs did not vote for a deal, then the delay would be \"a long one\". \"The issue is whether Brussels is clear on the terms of extension. \"In the end they will probably just give us an extension,\" he was quoted as saying. \"Got to make them believe that the week beginning end of March... extension is possible butthey dont vote for the deal then the extension is a long one...\" The comments by Mr Robbins - a key figure in the negotiations with the EU - will fuel the suspicion among MPs that Mrs May is trying to \"run down the clock\" to Brexit day on March  in an attempt to force them to back her agreement. Publicly the Prime Minister has always insisted the UK will leave on time - although a number of Cabinet ministers have raised the possibility of an extension. A Government spokesman said: \"We would not comment on alleged remarks from a private conversation which is said to have been overheard in a hotel bar.\" Meanwhile, the group led by Ms Cooper and Sir Oliver said they were preparing plans to enable Parliament to prevent the country falling into a no-deal Brexit \"by accident\". The move follows the announcement by Mrs May yesterday that she will make a further Commons statement on February  and table an amendable motion to be debated and voted on by MPs the following day,she has not got a deal at that point. The group say they would then put down an amendment creating parliamentary time for a bill requiring the Prime Minister and Parliament to decide by mid-March whether the UK is leaving with a deal, without a deal or whether it will seek an extension to Article . Ms Cooper said: \"This bill creates a Parliamentary safeguard to prevent us drting into no-deal by accident, and to prevent those crucial decisions being left until the final fortnight.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"alexa reveals idris elba is her celebrity crush ahead of valentines day","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

amount of waste going to landfill by %.Mr Hannaway said the council was also delighted to open the new poundm Down Leisure Centre which he described as a ldquosignature project that will make a real contribution to improving citizensrsquo health and wellbeing.ldquoWe are even more ambitious for the coming year, with the agreement on funding for the Belfast Region City Deal, we have plans for a new conference and theatre facility in Newry City, the delivery of the Southern Relief Road and a -year programme of economic growth, the chief executive continued.ldquoThe reopening of the Warrenpoint Municipal Park in August and the opening of the Carlingford Lough Greenway from Newry to Victoria Lock in July demonstrate our councilrsquos commitment to improving our arearsquos attractions and environment.Mr Hannaway said that in the coming year Newry and its Cathedral Corridor would see pound, for improvements, festive lighting and events, to building on what has already been achieved in these locations.His focus also turned to Brexit, explaining that as the March  deadline for leaving edges ever closer, the councilrsquos relationships with government departments, the EU, cross border bodies and institutions across Ireland and Britain will become even more important as it seeks to improve the district.ldquoThese partnerships will remain a priority for the coming year as we deliver initiatives, programmes and services for all the people living, working and investing in our district, he continued.ldquoSome of the projects that will be progressed during the   year include further revitalisation of Warrenpoint, with pound, for town improvements, including shop fronts, new signage and a promotional and marketing campaign.ldquoThe council has also secured approval for the Ballynahinch bypass, a plan that will greatly improve access throughout the area and relieve the traffic congestion in the town centre.Mr Hannaway said plans for the southern relief road in Newry will be progressed after the preferred route was announced and was confident that developing a strategic link road between the A Dublin Road and the A Warrenpoint Road mdash a project that the council is working on with Stormont officials ndash will contribute to increasing the economy of the whole region.He said improving public services and the way they were implemented was another important goal for the council in the new financial year, revealing that five ambitious performance improvement objectives had been identied.They include encouraging healthy lestyles, improving economic growth and promoting the district as a premier tourist destination, delivering urban and rural regeneration initiatives, creating a cleaner, greener district, and encouraging and empowering local communities to work with the Council to deliver on its programmes.ldquoOver the coming months, the council will be working with local groups to ensure that their views on how best to implement these important goals, he confirmed.ldquoOver the coming year, the historic town of Downpatrick will benefit from a new public realm improvement scheme as part of the Masterplan which will be delivered in partnership with the Department for Communities and the Department for Infrastructure.Mr Hannaway said the district continued to benefit from EU funding, with pound.m being provided to South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which promotes economic growth and job creation in coastal and inland communities.Under the PEACE IV programme pound.m had been allocated to the council to

of the table to nine points when they condemned Killough to the also rans category at The Links, Strangford on Saturday.Killough, who have been forced go play their home games anywhere they can as the Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan. No doubt his youngest, one year-old Alexandra, will be drafted in a few years time.Piper Ryan Green, who used to play for the former Seaforde and Woodgrange Pipe Bands, has also introduced his  year-old son, Matthew, while piper Robert Neill plays alongside his  year-old daughter Laura.Sometimes the pull towards piping and Hollymount misses a generation. However, the family influence remains strong as in the case of siblings Jessica and Thomas Watson, whose great grandfather, David Stranney, was in the band, although their parents werenrsquot.But the members know that keeping the band going for the next generation is an even greater challenge today than it was  years ago.They are delighted that it currently has  members aged  and under in the band.Apart from marching in the annual Twelfth celebrations, the main activity for the band is performing at local concerts where it has raised more than pound, in recent years for charities.Sam Gill says that the next big push, once some of the younger members are ready for it, will be to start competing in contests again, although they know it may take some time to reach their former B grade.ldquoTherersquos still a hunger to try and get the band to be as good as possible. The problem we have mdash and any band will tell you the same mdash is trying to keep the young ones interested becauseyou donrsquot, they will leave, he added.ldquoBands like ours are often recruitment bands for other larger ones but we would dearly love to see more experienced band members joining Hollymount and passing on their experience to the next generation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Contractors continue with leisure centre demolition  ","story":"WORK is progressing at pace to demolish the old Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick.Contractors are razing the old building to the ground as its poundm replacement continues to break membership records, with additional staff drafted in to cope with the volume of people coming through the doors.Four decades after the old centre opened, it is being reduced to a pile of rubble as the soaraway success of its ultra-modern replacement continues, with users flocking in their droves and membership doubling within a week.The old centre was the first major leisure complex built in the district and was one of the most modern of its kind when the doors opened for business, boasting a new swimming pool and a suite of other facilities, including a large sports hall.Contractors in charge of the demolition began work shortly before Christmas and over the past few weeks have made signicant progress.The old sports hall has been razed to the ground with contractors currently using heavy equipment to demolish the old swimming pools and reception area.The old centre was a major community hub and in addition to meeting the districtrsquos leisure needs, the large hall hosted many community events including public rallies, former Down Council election counts, drama productions and even concerts featuring a host of local artists.While the centre had long since passed its sell-by-date, the former Down Council was keen to replace it and the work the local authority started was completed by its successor, Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The old centre closed for the final time at the end of November,  years after it opened. Within a week of its multi-million pound replacement opening for business, membership numbers doubled.The stunning new three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.Boasting ultra-modern equipment, the magnicent and futuristic , square metre centre heralds an exciting new dawn in the history of leisure provision across the district with facilities including an  station wellness gymnasium featuring the latest equipment.There is also a -station spin studio, -metre six-lane swimming pool, luxury vitality health suite including a sauna, steam room and vitality pool.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU. However, the uncertainty is very damaging.ldquoWith March  less than  days away decisions need to be taken urgently and a deal agreed. Leaving the EU without a deal would be catastrophic for Northern Irelandrsquos farming families and their businesses.ldquoNo deal means high tarfs on our exports creating an effective trade embargo and the possibility of lower standard imports flooding the UK market.ldquoThese practical issues will have an immediate and profound impact on farmers, causing major disruptions to the supply chain, crippling the industry and rendering our farmers uncompetitive..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 6%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch headmaster hit out at the education authorities this week for the lack of permanent accommodation at his school where two thirds of the pupils are in wooden huts.Mr Harry Bent said St Colmanrsquos High School had been promised a major extension, but was unlikely to get it ldquoas long as comprehensive education is the policy of the Government.Speaking at the schoolrsquos annual prize day, Mr Bent said it angered him that the provision of accommodation had not kept pace with the growing numbers and successes of pupils.ldquoIn St Colmanrsquos nine temporary classrooms accommodate  pupils out of a total of , he said. ldquoThis means that almost two thirds of our pupils are in temporary accommodation which was first erected as a temporary measure ten years ago.Mr Bent stressed temporary classrooms may solve a financial problem for the Government, but there was so substitute for normal school accommodation.ldquoAt least  of the  subjects on the secondary curriculum are practical subjects, such as domestic science.

The front door still has its peep hole and numerous locks, but the interior certainly does not resemble a station. The cells have become the kitchen and the remaining rooms have been completely renovated.Because of its similarity with other police stations the current owners have had several amusing incidents when people have called looking for directions, or asking for stray drunks to be locked up for the night.A spokesman for the estate agents agreed that it was one of the most unusual buildings to appear on the property market and added that it would suit anyone worried about security problems!NEWCASTLE mdash Provisional plans for Newcastlersquos summer fun programme mdash the centrepiece of Down Districtrsquos holiday entertainment mdash are already being drawn up.Newcastle Town Committee mdash the local body which co-ordinates the summer programme mdash held its annual convention last week and preparations for this yearrsquos programme got underway.Members of the town committee have pledged their determination to make this yearrsquos event even bigger and better than before.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

He has no doubt that they will be relieved to hear that the scheme is definitely going ahead.He continued: ldquoI had wanted an extra filter lane to be provided, but due to the extensive underground utilities, the cost to relocate them would have delayed the installation of the puffin crossings.ldquoIn the interests of public safety, it is essential to push on with the committed works to provide the new puffin crossings before the end of March.ldquoI would like to thank roads officials for listening to the concerns of the Newcastle community and delivering on this important road safety priority.Last year, a new plan to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout in response to mounting local concern was outlined.Roads officials plan to create a new dedicated filter lane, enabling drivers entering the resort from the Dundrum direction and wishing to access the Castlewellan Road to do so without causing major tailbacks, leaving two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the town centre.It is understood officials have not yet fully costed the scheme, but they have confirmed they will require to shave off a section of land at the side of the roundabout to provide the new link road which they are confident can signicantly reduce congestion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle trio are nice and Trim  ","story":"FOR those preparing for a Spring Marathon, the Trim  Mile Road Race is the first opportunity to see how January training has gone and the progress made towards achieving whatever your goal might be.This has been a popular event among the NAC faithful in the past and the bus full of lsquomaybesrsquo was reasonably full last year.This year, the event proved more popular than ever and sold out in early January.

He said the review will not be completed until December.Cllr Curran said Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie were at the heart of their respective communities and that new investment was required to allow them to develop.ldquoWhile I welcome the planned review, I am concerned at how long it will take to complete. In addition, how will any recommendations around future investment for example be implemented in the absence of a ing Stormont Assembly  he asked.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to make pound, to assist with plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour, helping secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry.The local authority is making the cash available to the recently formed Ardglass harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals to help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ardglass.The money has been earmarked to help the new group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use.Cllr Curran said many people were eager to read the conclusions of the government departmentrsquos review, particularly in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.He added: ldquoAt this point in time all those within the fishing sector in particular are looking at the ongoing discussions around Brexit and wondering what any final decision will have on an already heavily regulated industry.Meanwhile, Ardglass Golf Club is the venue for a special event next Wednesday, February , when funding opportunities under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund support programme will be outlined during an information session which runs between am and .pm.The funding initiative is designed to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth through job creation and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture.This includes the ersication of activities within fisheries and into other sectors of the maritime economy with the pound.m funding cake being administered by the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which comprises representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors within the Newry, Mourne and Down and Ards and North Down council areas.The projects eligible for financial support must must demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s James and Kirsty dance to success  ","story":"YOUNG farmers from all over Co Down descended upon a Belfast hotel recently for this yearrsquos star-studded grand final of Strictly Young Farmers.More usually associated with Simmentals and Shorthorns the Strictly contestants showed they were equally at home with a good salsa or a samba on stage at the Crown Plaza Hotel in a bid to win the much revered glitter ball.The event sponsored by Barclays, saw Young Farmersrsquo clubs from all over Co Down welcome a crowd of over , made up of sponsors, family and friends, to support this yearrsquos dancers.The enthusiastic audience were dazzled with a vast array of steps and styles including the cha cha cha, jive, charleston, paso doble and American smooth.In preparation for the big night the committed couples underwent a strict regime every Monday evening since last November.Following much swinging, sweat and a lot of fake tan the couples were well able to showcase their talent at the annual event to raise funds for Alzheimerrsquos Society and local Young Farmersrsquo clubs.The event was hosted by past YFCU president Roberta Simmons, of Rathfriland YFC, past YFCU vice-president Harry Crosby, of Spa YFC, and current YFCU vice-president Andrew Patton, from Newtownards YFC.Assisting with the eveningrsquos entertainment were judges Karen Patterson from the BBC and past Young Farmer, James Trotman, Agri Manager for Barclays, Janet Plunkett, Fundraising Manager for Alzheimerrsquos Society in Northern Ireland, and Zita McNaugher, current YFCU deputy president.Competing couples George Porter and Laura Sproule, Matthew Ney and Rebecca Nelson, Chris Reid and Sarah Robinson, Harry Walker and Emma Connolly, James Gilpin and Emma McAnea, Ward Patterson and Sarah Reid, Richard Kennedy and Jessica Lee, Harry Hamilton and Louise McAnea, Graham Annett and Sarah Graham wowed the crowd with their twinkle toes.However, it was James McCauley and Kirsty Burrows, from Spa YFC, who danced their way to the top with their energetic charleston to be crowned Strictly winners .The organising committee, led by Co Down YFC chairperson Linzi Stewart and secretary Kristina McKeag, thanked everyone who helped make the night such a success, particularly sponsors, hosts, judges, family and friends and last but not least the dancers, who were the stars of the show..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17400640.back-in-the-day/resources/images/9393448.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

Mr Grech told the News Letter: “As a teenager I tried to have relationships with the opposite sex but I always felt there was something that wasn’t fully connecting.”Later, he was in a relationship with a man in London when a woman invited him to a prayer gathering. “I absolutely loved it ...These people had something that I wanted – joy, love and peace.”He became a Christian and started to read the Bible, where he gained the perspective that homosexuality is “not about your feelings or sexual orientation ... in the Bible it is a practise, it is an act ...I stopped practising homosexuality then I would not be homosexual in God’s eyes.“I wasn’t preached to. I didn’t go through some kind of therapy.” He added: “I am on my journey. Personally I have not yet experienced sexual attraction to a woman. But I am open.” He is aware of criticism that his message could cause distress to some. “But there are also others who have unwanted same-sex desires. Many people have contacted me and said, ‘Wow! I felt so encouraged by your story’.” There is no conversion therapy in the film, he insisted.John O’Doherty of the Rainbow Project said: “The clearest message to those promoting conversion therapy comes from those who have themselves survived it. It doesn’t work and it causes irreparable harm to members of our community.”Danielle Roberts of HER NI agreed: “So-called gay conversion therapy is damaging to LGBT+ people as it suggests that sexual orientation is something that is a choice, or something to be ‘cured’.”Section of road closed after discovery of suspicious object Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The church said that it rejects homophobia and nobody should be forced into therapy, adding that both the screening and protest “are legitimate actions in a free society”.The film will released on Thursday on Youtube and at www.voicesofthesilenced.try catch  TrendingThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieN.I. child hasnt been seen since Sunday - P.S.N.I. investigatingStorm Erik worse than originally thought - Met Office extend warning as mph gales pummel N.I.Northern Ireland: The market value of all  players in Michael ONeills pound.m squadDerry Girls series two trailer released          ..

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house_11.jpg","title":"future of house of fraser in belfast secured amid fresh lease","story":"Posted on Friday February  by John Mulgrew The future of House of Fraser in Belfast appears to be safe after the retailer signed a fresh lease on its anchor store at Victoria Square, it can be revealed.
