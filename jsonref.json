Someone who speaks from the dispatch box utterly across the detail and addresses serious policy not just the politics.’         Number 10 has already told ministers not to go on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme following allegations of bias. (Pictured: Lewis Goodall holding an electoral map of the UK)After Channel 4 miscaptioned a speech by Mr Johnson to wrongly suggest he had referred to ‘people of colour’ – it was actually ‘people of talent’ – Mr Goodall was one of the first to retweet the slur.When Mr Johnson was at the centre of a row in 2018 over his remarks likening Muslim women wearing burkas to letterboxes and bank robbers, Mr Goodall likened it to the furore over the late Tory MP Enoch Powell’s notorious ‘rivers of blood’ speech in 1968 on the supposed dangers of immigration. Mr Goodall wrote on a blog that the burka row showed that in Britain ‘you can say what you like as long as you’re posh’, adding: ‘Imagine the same words said with an Essex or Yorkshire or Brummie accent. Imagine them being said not by Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, but by a labourer, on camera for a clip on the six o’clock news’. In that case, he said, the PM’s remarks were more likely to be seen as ‘prejudiced, ignorant, rude, vulgar and yes, probably racist’.He added: ‘With Mr Johnson, there is no such fear or worry of guilt by association. Rather, because of his verbosity, his humour, his Bertie Wooster cut-glass accent and demeanour, because of his power, he cannot be any of those things.‘In this he resembles another would-be populist, indeed, the first: Enoch Powell... It is perhaps not mere coincidence that both men were classicists. It is their place atop of the English hierarchy of culture and class which makes them all the more grievous… It legitimises the prejudices of others, further down the class food chain, it suggests that certain things which probably ought not to be alright, in fact are. That is why I give the suggestion that there has been an increase in the numbers of attacks on women wearing the niqab in recent days absolute credibility.’Last night, a senior adviser to a Cabinet Minister told The Mail on Sunday: ‘There is no way I am going to let my Minister go in front of someone like Goodall, and plenty of others feel the same way. Newsnight has been moving off our radar for years – this will just speed up the process.’ The BBC is considering banning its journalists from using Twitter because of the growing row about bias.

His appointment has led to further criticism of the BBCMr Goodall was studying history and politics at Oxford when he began writing opinion pieces for The Guardian, which described him as ‘a Labour Party activist and blogger’. He has also worked for the Left-wing Institute for Public Policy Research. In 2018 he wrote a book called Left For Dead? The Strange Death And Rebirth Of The Labour Party.Last weekend, author Charles Moore, a guest editor on Today, accused the BBC of reflecting the prejudices of its managers.

The evolution of drone technology allows new ways of seeing, not possible even from the most manoeuvrable helicopter. The German photographer Tom Hegen has been a pioneer of such opportunities. Shooting directly downwards from a hovering near-stationary drone, he can flatten out perspective to the point that the Earth’s surface seems like a stretched canvas. His images of salt production landscapes in southern Europe give the sense that Google Earth has been hacked by abstract expressionist painters.This picture was taken above the pink lakes and white mountains of the salt industry at Aigues-Mortes near Montpellier in the south of France. Salt has been processed continuously from the marshes here since Roman times. To create table salt, seawater is channelled through 45 miles (70km) of intricate canals or roubines. The area is now restricted to visitors because of its unique ecosystem.Hegen says he was drawn to photograph here partly to document the brutal recasting of the landscape by centuries of human activity, and partly to capture the glorious geometries and colour contrasts. His picture is included in a new book, From Above: The Story of Aerial Photography. “I draw my inspiration from classic painters like Mark Rothko,” Hegen says. “I see all human beings as designers of our planet. And I see myself as a sort of framer, framing the artworks of the earth’s surface with my camera.”From Above: The Story of Aerial Photography by Eamonn McCabe and Gemma Padley is published by Laurence King (£40)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2ca60dea33303108dd5c939ae835f53f6c1a421/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d86b5880675bfcfeda780b5eff6471b","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"The drone strike in Baghdad, bushfires in Australia, the continuing unrest in Hong Kong and New Year celebrations – the best photography in news, culture and sport from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/949976fc53b187fa154ae48315a8366f02ff5068/0_722_9294_5577/master/9294.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d1177a5ce83fecad5bc3b615da5dbf3","title":"original observer photography","story":"Stormzy, Robert Pattinson, fashion and clowns – the best photography commissioned by the Observer in December 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b320210c8b0d5b8a2eb5aaedb32f14dec366ad6/0_409_5904_3543/master/5904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad76b37c68ab5e48b200dd4c4ffa51ae","title":"the playful modernism of designer george him in pictures","story":"Jerzy Himmelfarb was an acclaimed graphic designer in his native Poland and later Germany before changing his name to George Him and moving to London in 1937, where he stayed throughout the second world war. “He was influential as an advocate for the value of graphic design as a creative practice and a way to connect with people, says Olivia Ahmad, curator of a new exhibition of Him’s wartime propaganda posters, packaging design and children’s illustrations.

The nationwide closures would also result in job losses, HMV said.Closing down signs have been put up in many of the stores, which are also holding “everything must go” sales.The beleaguered music retailer, which last year was saved after falling into administration, confirmed that HMV Bury St Edmunds, Fopp Glasgow on Byres Road and HMV Nuneaton will shut at the end of January, with new tenants already lined up to move into the properties.In a statement, HMV said the stores were no longer viable due to “extortionate” business rates in certain locations.The announcement came as the department store chain Debenhams said it was due to close 19 of its stores between 11 and 25 January, with a further 28 reportedly set to close in 2021.HMV said it was also relocating in Lincoln and Plymouth, with new stores opening in both cities at the start of February.“There are currently 10 stores where negotiations with landlords are ongoing and we are hopeful of securing new deals,” a HMV spokesman said. “The closures are no reflection on our superb staff and where we are not able to come to a new agreement or relocate staff within the business elsewhere, unfortunately this does mean some of our staff will lose their jobs.”The 10 stores that are subject to negotiations are in Birmingham Bullring, Cribbs in Bristol, Edinburgh’s Ocean Terminal, Glasgow Braehead, Grimsby, Leeds, Merryhill near Dudley, Reading, Sheffield’s Meadowhall mall and Worcester.Fans of HMV expressed their displeasure on social media at the closures, with one saying the move was “disgusting”.HMV was purchased in a rescue deal by music mogul Doug Putman in February 2019 after it crashed into administration for the second time in five years in December 2018.Putman, who runs the Canadian retailer Sunrise Records, closed 15 stores after beating off a bid from Sports Direct’s Mike Ashley.In October Putman opened the Vault, which is the biggest music and movies outlet in Europe.

The company confirmed the Vault would not be affected by the closures.Putman previously said he hoped to reopen the stores that were closed when he bought HMV last year, including the Oxford Street flagship in London.Speaking to the  in February, Putman said he was optimistic that these outlets could be reopened: “Where certain stores have closed, our public have really rallied around and I credit that with some of the landlords coming back to us. They can see how much support we are getting.”Putman said he was in talks with landlords of several of the stores that were closed. As well as Oxford Street, these included the Trafford Centre in Manchester, Meadowhall in Sheffield, Westfield in White City, west London, and Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, all prime locations.At the time, Putman also pledged to invest at least £10m in reviving the chain and wants to make his shops part of local communities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a803faa685951bbe66d5f618bbfd0a8f685874e0/0_276_8318_4994/master/8318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf871ddbe34134c9fc786183e6447456","title":"secret diary of carrie symonds","story":"In which our heroine contemplates the beauty of Mustique and searches for the PMSuper Christmas!

But he’s right that Britain must adapt to surviveWhen Dominic Cummings arrived in Downing Street, some of his new colleagues were puzzled by one of his mantras: “Get Brexit done, then Arpa”. Now, perhaps, they have some idea of what that meant. On 2 January, Cummings published on his blog the wackiest job proposals to emerge from a government since the emperor Caligula made his horse a consul.The ad took the form of a long post under the heading “We’re hiring data scientists, project managers, policy experts, assorted weirdos…”, included a reading list of arcane academic papers that applicants were expected to read and digest and declared that applications from “super-talented weirdos” would be especially welcome. They should assemble a one-page letter, attach a CV and send it to ideasfornumber10@gmail. (Yes, that’s @gmail.)It was clear that nobody from HR was involved in composing this call for clever young things. Alerting applicants to the riskiness of employment by him, Cummings writes: “I’ll bin you within weeks if you don’t fit – don’t complain later because I made it clear now.”The ad provoked predictable outrage and even the odd parody. The most interesting thing about it, though, is its revelations of what moves the man who is now the world’s most senior technocrat. The “Arpa” in his mantra, for example, is classic Cummings, because the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (now Darpa) is one of his inspirational models. It was set up in 1958 as part of America’s response to the Soviet space satellite programme and was charged with generating and executing research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science.Arpa, as it was then known, was the agency that funded the arpanet, the precursor to the internet, and is famous for the lavishness of its funding, the speed with which it operates and its decisiveness. When Bob Taylor had the idea of funding the arpanet, for example, it took him just 20 minutes to get his boss to agree to it. Other Cummings inspirations are the Manhattan Project, which built the first atomic bomb, and the Apollo mission, which first put men on the moon.Note that all these inspirational projects have some interesting things in common: no “politics”, no bureaucratic processes and no legal niceties. Which is exactly how Cummings likes things to be.One of Cummings’s abiding obsessions over the past few years (often aired on his blog) is his conviction that “SW1” – his term for the entire government machine and its political masters – is totally unfit for purpose in the modern era. In a way, his job ad is a 3,000-word articulation of this belief. SW1, as he sees it, is scientifically and technologically illiterate, stuffed with Oxbridge humanities graduates, generalists, amateurs, etc. When mounted on this particular hobbyhorse, Cummings sounds like CP Snow on speed.I have some sympathy with these views – as do some of the younger civil servants I meet. The problem is that the thinking implicit in Cummings’s blog post is flawed in two ways. The first is that he has swallowed the Silicon Valley delusion that data (and data science) provide the key to life, the universe and everything. The second is that his recruitment wheeze is strategically naive. The idea that the huge bureaucratic machine of the British state can be transformed by the injection of a cadre of disruptive young geniuses is, to put it mildly, bonkers. The civil service has a powerful immune system for rejecting outsiders and Cummings’s stated ambition – that his new hires will make him redundant in a year or two – is therefore daft. What he has are ideas when what he needs is a strategy.Which is odd, because his main claim to fame from the Vote Leave campaign and Johnson’s election victory is as a gifted strategist. Deep down, Cummings is what the economist Tyler Cowen calls a “state capacity libertarian”. This sounds like an oxymoron (a libertarian who believes in a strong state), but what it appears to involve is a conviction about the need for a capable state. In this regard, writes Cowen, “sometimes the problem is too much government, sometimes the problem is not enough government. Most often, the problem is the wrong sort of government.”If this is indeed what Cummings believes (and much of his derisive blogging about the stupidity and incapacity of SW1 suggests that it is), then he needs a more sustained strategy to make the British state more capable of handling the challenges of governing a 21st-century society. In other words, a state that would never have screwed up on a universal credit scale.In some ways, Cummings is his own worst enemy (though David Cameron might retort: “Not while I’m around”). Many people are repelled by the way he interweaves radical insights with what looks like vulgar abuse. He mixes understanding with wacky afterthoughts and lets his compulsive autodidactism run away with him.But he also has an acute sense (which most Brexiters seem to lack) that a UK outside the EU will need to become a much more capable and creative state if it is to escape becoming either a gigantic imitation of Singapore or the sandpit for private equity envisaged by Jacob Rees-Mogg and his cronies. Given Cummings’s role in Number 10, and the elective dictatorship bestowed on his master by the rackety British constitution, he has a real opportunity to do some good. Let’s hope he takes it.• John Naughton writes the Networker column for Observer New Review"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1051765c5e9bf447fe3670f79f4e7432218cfb3b/0_2_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c451d08964020dd8824a3cd785ec6932","title":"20 for 2020 rising stars unmissable things","story":"Sally Rooney’s Normal People gets a 12-part TV adaptation, Lana Del Rey performs her acclaimed new album, Top Gun 2 is finally given permission to land, and there’s new talent galore…Thalissa Teixeira was hoping not to die in 2020. But she’s playing Bianca in Thomas Middleton’s Women Beware Women at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, so sadly she will cop it at the end (no great spoiler – it is a Jacobean tragedy after all). She laughs. “At the audition I said: ‘Do we have to see another woman die?’ So many plays I’ve done, women die: in Yerma, Billie died in Julie, Vanessa died in Blood Wedding, Aoife died…”Teixira has a point, but this bloody litany also serves as a handy summary of the 27-year-old’s impressive CV. Since graduating from the Royal Welsh College in 2014, she’s played opposite Vanessa Kirby in Polly Stenham’s Miss Julie at the National Theatre, and with Billie Piper and Aoife Duffin in the Lorca plays Yerma and Blood Wedding at the Young Vic.Teixeira is a memorable performer, even in supporting roles – but this looks to be a break-out year. She stars opposite Maisie Williams in Sky’s crime caper Two Weeks to Live, playing a “stone-cold” cop, and in Trigonometry – a BBC Two comedy written by Duncan Macmillan and Effie Woods about a flatshare that turns into a polyamorous relationship.“It’s nothing to do with maths – thank God, because I would not be able to act that!” says Teixeira. She was so desperate to get the part, she wrote a pleading letter to the director Athina Tsangari after her audition. “It’s funny: so many people are wanting to use the term ‘controversial’ because it’s about three people falling in love together, but it’s never been a word we used,” says Teixeira.Live performance is still her main love, however: Teixeira is part of storytelling group the Embers Collective. “It’s one of the most terrifying performances: you’re retelling an ancient story that’s been told millions of times before, in your own words, no one’s directed you, you have nowhere to hide. It’s so revealing – which is probably why I love it. I’m a bit addicted to it.”She links this urge to perform to her heritage: born in Bradford to a black Brazilian father and white British mother, she was raised in El Salvador, returning to the UK when she was eight. “It’s probably why I became an actor, because in Brazil everyone is performing all the time.”Teixeira considers herself lucky that she’s rarely been cast because of her race – but adds that she “hates” the term “colourblind casting”. That change needs to be seen in the writing, she says. “Why are we putting on plays written by long-dead, white, fascist, racist men, and then putting some black people in it? Why don’t we put more money into plays about people Ian McKellen would never be able to perform?”Holly WilliamsIt promises to be a tremendous year for fiction, with an embarrassment of big-name novelists returning to the fray. There will be new novels from Anne Tyler, Isabel Allende, Lionel Shriver, Roddy Doyle, Sebastian Barry and JM Coetzee, but it will be hardest to miss Hilary Mantel, who will publish the third and final book in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy in March – an event looked forward to with as much feverish longing as the follow-up to The Handmaid’s Tale last year. The first two books in the series, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, both won the Man Booker prize (a unique achievement for successive novels), so it’s a good bet that The Mirror and the Light will make for a triumphant finale. Maggie O’Farrell’s Hamnet (March) marks a departure for a much-loved and acclaimed author as she too takes on historical fiction. “Dazzling. Devastating,” says Kamila Shamsie of the novel, which was inspired by the family tragedy of Shakespeare’s son, who died aged 11. Also eagerly awaited is the debut novel by US nonfiction author Ta-Nehisi Coates. The Water Dancer merges historical and fantasy fiction in a slavery story that Oprah Winfrey says is one of the best books she has read in her life. Phew!Ursula KennyCats arrived to widespread derision last month, but hopes remain high for several splashy, stage-derived musicals in 2020. While the world waits for a Hamilton movie, Lin-Manuel Miranda fans will be tided over with the film of his earlier Broadway smash In the Heights, a vibrant ensemble piece set within New York’s Latin American community, with a score encompassing salsa and hip-hop. It’ll make for an interesting contrast to Steven Spielberg’s Ansel Elgort-starring remake of the beloved West Side Story, adapted by Pulitzer-winning playwright Tony Kushner. Here in Britain, meanwhile, surprise West End hit Everybody’s Talking About Jamie is coming to the screen with a cast of bright young things and stalwarts including Richard E Grant this feelgood story of a teenage drag queen could be the next Billy Elliot.Guy LodgeThe plot of Sally Rooney’s phenomenally successful second novel presents no obvious barriers to adaptation: this story of two young people negotiating the pitfalls of love and tertiary education in post-crash Ireland is ripe for onscreen drama. Whether the new 12-part TV version of Normal People for the BBC and Hulu (airing this spring) can match Rooney’s razor-sharp psychological observations and weightless narrative flow is another question. But the talent behind it bodes well, with Lenny Abrahamson, the Irish director of Room, Frank and Garage, overseeing the series alongside Hettie Macdonald (Doctor Who, Fortitude). Cold Feet actor Daisy Edgar-Jones and newcomer Paul Mescal play Marianne and Connell.Killian FoxIt’s often said that change in British theatre will only come about when you change who’s in charge. And a new trend in 2019 has proved quietly progressive: job shares. The artistic directorship of Manchester Royal Exchange is now split between two rising directing talents: Bryony Shanahan and Roy Alexander Weise. They join other recent appointments – Charlotte Bennett and Katie Posner at Paines Plough Debbie Hannan and Gareth Nicholls at the Traverse – in opening up possibilities for more collaborative arts leadership.“Who we are and what we look like and the point at which we are in our careers is maybe a bit different,” Shanahan says. She met Weise in 2013, when they both had a BBC theatre fellowship in 2016, each won emerging director awards, resulting in shows at the Young Vic – Trade by Debbie Tucker Green for Shanahan and Katori Hall’s The Mountaintop for Weise. Shanahan has since directed Queens of the Coal Age at the Royal Exchange, while Weise has directed Nine Night and Master Harold and the Boys at the National Theatre.That they have an easygoing friendship is evident when we meet, but their differing styles complement each other too: Shanahan is softly spoken, a little more cautious, while Weise tends to jump into answers, all beaming grins and belly laughs. When he says she’ll be looking after all the spreadsheets, he’s joking – but she might just be the more practical one. On the day Weise moved house from his native London to Didsbury, just outside Manchester, she turned up at his doorstep with bags of groceries.The job share came about because they are mates – a friendship that really developed when Weise stayed with Shanahan in Manchester, where she’s lived and worked for four years (she grew up in Staffordshire). “Bryony was coming home every day with this great passion for the theatre and what it could be,” Weise recalls.And Shanahan does believe the theatre’s in-the-round space is rather special. “It’s a democratic arena – it doesn’t let you be dishonest, audiences can sniff it out. So there’s a really healthy lack of pretension here.”“A lot like Manchester,” laughs Weise. “People tell you how it is!”HWIf nothing else, 2020 looks as if it’s going to be a vintage year for live music, with a number of major tours on the horizon. Kicking off proceedings – injuries permitting – Madonna plays a run of London dates from 27 January to 15 February, touring her latest album Madame X.Next, purveyor of swooning melodies Lana Del Rey brings Sad Girl winter to our shores (25 Feb, London to 29 Feb, Birmingham) a new album, White Hot Forever, is in the works.Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds (2 May, Birmingham to 15 May, London) tour their latest double album, Ghosteen, which is largely about the death of Cave’s teenage son. Its tender, intimate songs may not feel like obvious arena fillers, but the tour is set to be an emotional experience for everyone involved.Dressed like a Soundcloud rapper and murmuring vaguely threatening lines about teenage hormones and death, Billie Eilish returns with her genre-shredding ASMR bangers (21 July, Manchester to 30 July, London).He set trends, dem man copy: Michael Omari, AKA Stormzy, AKA Big Michael, returns to live music after his victorious Glastonbury headline set with a powerful second album, Heavy Is the Head (2 Sept, London to 22 Sept, Bournemouth).Finally, the Rocketman himself. After a mammoth run of dates around the world, the UK leg of Elton John’s widely anticipated Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour starts and ends in London (2 Nov to 17 Dec), via various other cities, before he retires from live performance. So long, tiny dancer.Kathryn BromwichA jubilant ensemble drama about a group of Hackney teenagers, Rocks was a hit on the festival circuit last year. The film’s title may allude to something rough and grey but the movie is anything but – each performance is its own shimmering, incandescent diamond. Newcomer Bukky Bakray is Shola, aka Rocks, an enterprising sixth former who makes quick cash perfecting her classmates’ makeup on her lunch break. When her depressed mother disappears, Rocks must temporarily assume the role of caretaker for younger brother Emmanuel (D’Angelou Osei Kissiedu), simultaneously juggling lessons, friendship dramas, and the looming threat of social services. It’s unclear when – or if – her mum will return.Among the film’s more experienced female crew members are casting director Lucy Pardee, who has worked with Andrea Arnold, and cinematographer Hélène Louvart (who shot Happy as Lazzaro and Beach Rats). Even more moving than its background though is the film itself, which despite its courageous, downbeat ending is thrillingly alive in its depictions of adolescent joy.Simran HansLondon theatre holds a perennial appeal for the A-lister who wants to prove their acting credentials – but by any standards, 2020 is a bonanza year for big names. The Old Vic kicks off with Daniel Radcliffe in Beckett’s Endgame in January, with Timothée Chalamet arriving for Amy Herzog’s 4000 Miles in April. In the West End, Jessica Chastain stars in a production of Ibsen’s A Doll’s House at the Playhouse in June, while in March, Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke will make her West End debut there in Chekhov’s The Seagull, adapted by Anya Reiss and directed by Jamie Lloyd. Jake Gyllenhaal brings his acclaimed performance in Sondheim’s Sunday in the Park With George to the Savoy come June. At the Young Vic, Cush Jumbo takes on the big one: see her Hamlet from July. In the same month, the actual Whoopi Goldberg really does get back in the habit as Sister Act hits the Hammersmith Apollo. And it’s not just Hollywood actors: West Wing screenwriter Aaron Sorkin brings his Broadway-conquering adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird to the Gielgud theatre from May.HWComedy sketch duo Freya Parker and Celeste Dring, AKA Lazy Susan, are describing their feelings about being named rising stars in 2020 by this paper. “We’re glowing,” deadpans Dring. “Buoyant. It’s tricky to get things done because we keep floating up off the floor.”Trying to interview the pair involves separating fact from their flights of fancy. “We’re both from showbiz dynasties,” claims Dring. “Our parents are clowns.”Parker picks up the baton: “And we met at Eton. It’s a heartwarming riches-to-riches story.”They’ve actually been writing and performing together for five years, after being introduced by a mutual friend when they’d left university and were “doing bits and bobs” in fringe theatre. “We started off trying to write a play together but it was so bleak and awful, I shudder when I think of it,” cringes Parker. “We kept dicking around doing characters instead, so we accidentally began writing comedy.”Last year, the duo released a well-received sketch show pilot on BBC iPlayer, which then got a terrestrial airing on BBC2. It was based on their sellout Edinburgh run, which sent up post-#MeToo sexual anxiety and saw them greet the audience with: “Good afternoon, ladies and predators!” This year, more TV projects beckon, but they’re currently top secret. “You’ll definitely be seeing more of us in 2020,” says Parker.Parker grew up in Teesside, worshipping Vic and Bob (“They were like gods in the north east”). Dring comes from Wolverhampton, where her early comedic influences were Nickelodeon cartoon Rocko’s Modern Life and 1999 beauty pageant comedy Drop Dead Gorgeous: “It’s got a dynamite cast and was the first time I saw lots of women being funny together, so it was an important film for me.”The Lazy Susan name can be a bit of a liability when it comes to the opposite sex. “It’s a joke that lame men make,” explains Parker. “Which one’s lazy and which one’s Susan? Hur-hur-hur.”“And I’m like, Are you single?” trills Dring sweetly. “But I like it because it’s both an object and sounds like a description of a woman.” Parker chips in: “I like the fact that it’s got a Z in it.”“You’re not playing Scrabble, mate,” says Dring.As well as having projects together in the pipeline, they’ll both be popping up elsewhere in TV comedy this year. Parker is among the ensemble cast of BBC Two’s The Mash Report. “It’s coming back in spring and I’m chuffed to be part of it,” she grins. “These are dark times, so we need satire more than ever at the moment.”Dring plays Princess Eugenie in royal sitcom The Windsors. “We just shot the new series, which airs next month,” she says. “You’ll have to watch it to see if there are any scenes set in Pizza Express in Woking.” No sweat.Michael HoganWith Woolf Works (2015), Wayne McGregor pioneered a new form of full-length narrative ballet that yoked together three contrasting acts under one banner. His latest epic piece for the Royal Ballet, where he is resident choreographer, sounds even more ambitious: a journey inspired by Dante’s The Divine Comedy, moving from Inferno, through Purgatorio to Paradiso, with a newly commissioned score by Thomas Adès that is symphonic in scale, and designs by the artist Tacita Dean. McGregor’s muse Edward Watson stars, alongside Francesca Hayward and Matthew Ball at the Royal Opera House (6 May - 1 June). Inferno premiered in Los Angeles in 2019, where it was warmly received much anticipation surrounds the completed piece.Sarah Crompton“Life kit” podcasts have been around for a bit – think Gretchen Rubin’s Happier podcast, or all those shows on how to become better at businessbeing mindfulnoticing how crappy your life is – but there will be even more coming in 2020. Such podcasts have tended to be American (NPR even launched a specific “life kit” strand around a year ago), but now the UK is joining in. Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke, authors of the best-selling Slay in Your Lane, are launching Slay: How to Succeed in Your Career Alex Holder, whose book Open Up: Why Talking About Money Will Change Your Life was another hit this year, will be bringing out Awkward Conversations About Money.

Expect a plethora of career and life management podcasts, so you can listen and feel as though you’re actually doing something about that crappy life of yours.Miranda SawyerFyzal Boulifa is a hard man to pin down for an interview. When his schedule finally permits a moment on the phone, he’s up in the mountains at France’s Les Arcs film festival, the latest stop in a crammed festival tour. The Paris-based Brit arrived directly from Marrakech, following visits to Macao and London, for the British independent film awards, where he was nominated for best debut director. “I haven’t been home in a couple of weeks,” he says, sounding sprightlier than you might expect. “I’m honestly excited to get back tomorrow and do laundry.”Boulifa is busy promoting his first feature, Lynn + Lucy, a shattering study of female friendship riven by tragedy and community gossip. An exercise in subtly stylised social realism set in a working-class, predominantly white pocket of Essex, it’s not the breakthrough film many people expected Boulifa – the gay, Leicester-born son of Moroccan parents – to make after his last two shorts won top prizes in Cannes.But Boulifa delights in surprising people. “Diversity can be a poisoned chalice,” he says. “Identity politics are very primary right now: people in the industry have ideas of who you are and where you come from, and expect the stories you tell to directly use that cultural currency. We’re in a progressive moment, but there can be a regressive side to that.”He sees Lynn + Lucy, inspired by a real-life Bristol case that made tabloid headlines, as his lateral way of processing the society he grew up in, but he has no interest in declaratively personal or autobiographical work. He describes the late German auteur Rainer Werner Fassbinder as his greatest inspiration, “because none of his films were definitive – each was its own strange object”.With that in mind, he’s developing two very different follow-up projects: the first a Moroccan-set drama drawn loosely from family lore, the second a teen horror film based on a Junji Ito manga. Having dropped out of film school to take a more self-taught route into the business – “I needed to make my own mistakes,” he laughs – he’s been mostly settled in Paris since attending a film-makers’ residence and meeting his boyfriend there in 2013. The French film world, he says, is less gatekeeper-oriented than the British industry. “And with Brexit…” his voice trails off, no follow-up needed. He is, as I said, not a man to be pinned down.GLShiny new shows often steal the limelight, but plenty of our favourite series will also be returning like long-lost friends. First out of the blocks is the second season of bawdy Netflix teen comedy Sex Education, which arrives on 17 January.This will be followed by the eighth and final season of CIA saga Homeland on Channel 4 on 16 February. We’ll also see Sky Atlantic’s Save Me too, a sequel to Lennie James’s down and dirty southeast London thriller, and a BBC1 return for JK Rowling’s sleuth Cormoran Strike in Lethal White.Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar return in ITV’s cold case whodunit Unforgotten, as does Elisabeth Moss in The Handmaid’s Tale season four. Finally, after leaving on a killer cliffhanger, HBO’s Succession sails its super-yacht back on to our screens this summer and it won’t be plain sailing for the rich but deeply dysfunctional Roy dynasty. We can’t wait.MHRevolutionary, visionary, genius, Beethoven made a colossal impact on the history of music. Already the most performed composer, in the 250th anniversary of his birth he’ll reach new ubiquity, but with 650 known compositions there’s much to discover. Worldwide celebrations will centre on Bonn, city of his birth, and Vienna, where he made his name. In the UK, hear all nine symphonies in a blockbuster weekend at the Barbican or follow the LSO’s series with Simon Rattle. Check out Southbank Centre and Wigmore Hall too.Manchester’s Hallé, Birmingham’s CBSO, Liverpool’s RLPO and Poole’s BSO all have big events planned. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are busy too. BBC Radio 3’s Donald Macleod will explore Beethoven’s life throughout the year on Composer of the Week: an epic 125 hours in total.Fiona MaddocksFor fans of super-luxe lifestyle porn and extravagant stunts featuring (and frequently damaging) the world’s most beautiful travel destinations, a new James Bond movie is always a cause for celebration. The latest in the series, No Time to Die, out 3 April, sees Bond stepping back from active service, only to clash with a new breed of 00 agent and a heavily armed, tech savvy villain. Locations include Italy, Norway and the Scottish Highlands and Cary Joji Fukunaga (True Detective) directs.Another class act in the world of action is Tom Cruise, who gets to pull on his flying jacket and aviator shades once more in a sequel to Top Gun. Not much is known about Top Gun: Maverick (out 17 July), which is set 34 years after the original. But expect plenty of breathtaking aerial stunts, numerous shots of Tom Cruise grinning devilishly while driving recklessly fast, and an acknowledgment that, in the age of drones, pilots like Maverick are a dying breed.For sheer spectacle, however, action fans should put 27 March in their diaries: that’s the release date for Whale Rider director Niki Caro’s lavish remake of Mulan, which promises to be a martial arts extravaganza of staggering scale and ambition. More serious in tone than other Disney live-action remakes, so think Crouching Tiger rather than Little Mermaid.Wendy IdeTraditional guitar bands are dead: in 2020, long live the raucous, provocative, sprawling collective. Black Country, New Road are the latest in a wave of interesting groups in this mould, following the Mercury-nominated Black Midi, Squid and Working Men’s Club. Mixing sounds from post-punk and post-rock with new ideas, the seven-piece, who met at school in Cambridge, have only released two singles so far, but their live shows have been thrilling, packed affairs.The songs help. Dark, twisting creatures powered by saxophone and violin, as well as guitar, bass, drums and synths, they’re taken in peculiar directions by frontman Isaac Wood’s constantly bifurcating lyrics. Sex, pop culture and gloomier matters are their primary subjects. “She flies to Paris, France, I come down in her childhood bed,” begins first single, Athen’s France (the misplaced apostrophe is deliberate). “Leave Kanye out of thisLeave your Sertraline in the cabinetAnd fuck me like you mean it this time, Isaac,” wails the insistent Sunglasses.Wood doesn’t always do interviews, which suits BC, NR’s collective spirit: saxophonist Lewis Evans and bassist Tyler Hyde speak today from their adopted home of London. Both are 21, sparky and brightly polite. “Isaac didn’t write lyrics before 2018,” Evans starts. “He was brilliant out of nowhere. It’s bizarre he’s so good.” Hyde agrees. “We like how what he writes feels so honest – he’s not hiding behind anything. Also, they say a lot literally and texturally. They’re part of the overall ensemble.”The band’s obvious musical fluency comes from most of them having played together since they were 15 (apart from new recruit, guitarist Luke Mark) they “gravitated towards each other” at school, Evans says. “The music department there was amazing,” he is at pains to point out. “Properly funded, with brilliant teachers. It absolutely paved the way for us to do what we do now.”They were another band, Nervous Conditions, until January 2018, driven by the principles of free improvisation. Regrouping later that year with a new frontman and name (which Wood has described as meaning “a good way out of a bad place”) they released their first single on influential south London label Speedy Wunderground in April. Sunglasses followed in August. Both quickly sold out.Feverishly received gigs at Brixton’s Windmill Club and summer festivals also helped cement who the new band were. “We were interacting, developing and even doing a lot of songwriting live – and that helped us feel confident together,” says Hyde, excitedly. The new material will be released soon, she hopes. So does the whole indie scene. That dark tarmac’s glistening brightly.Jude RogersIf 2019 was the year of the single-girl memoir, with confessional writing by the likes of Dolly Alderton (All I Know About Love) and Elizabeth Day (How to Fail) flying off the shelves, 2020 looks set to be a year of memoirs exploring a very different aspect of women’s lives: motherhood.Motherwell by the late Deborah Orr is a story about her girlhood in the shadow of the Ravenscraig steelworks she both loved and hated and her escape to university. But more than that, it is a tender, unflinching account of her relationship with her difficult, controlling mother, made all the more poignant by the fact that Orr did not live to see it published (it will be out later this month).Nell Frizzell’s The Panic Years, out in May, explores how she grappled with that “mother of all decisions” that looms over almost every woman in their 30s: whether or not to have a baby. And in The Hungover Games, coming in March, Sophie Heawood describes how it feels to have an “accidental” baby on your own at the same life-stage - two contrasting experiences of becoming a mother that nonetheless share universal truths.Candice Brathwaite highlights another far less talked-about aspect of becoming a mother in I Am Not Your Baby Mother, out in May. Her book is an account of how, finding herself pregnant, she began to notice the way motherhood is portrayed in the British media. Where, she wondered, are all the black mothers? The experience led her to start blogging about the subject and found the initiative Make Motherhood Diverse, which aims to encourage a more inclusive depiction of motherhood in the media.Lisa O’KellyWhatever happened to fictional detectives cracking imaginary cases? The TV trend for true crime dramas will continue with a vengeance this year, starting with this week’s White House Farm on ITV, which finds Freddie Fox playing gunman Jeremy Bamber.This will be followed by Quiz from playwright James Graham and director Stephen Frears, telling the story of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire “cough-gate” cheating scandal. Its mouthwatering cast includes Michael Sheen as Chris Tarrant, Matthew Macfadyen as Major Charles Ingram and Fleabag’s Sian Clifford as his wife, Diana.David Tennant will play Muswell Hill murderer Dennis Nilsen in ITV drama Des, while Stephen Merchant plays so-called “Grindr killer” Stephen Port in BBC1’s The Barking Murders. There’s also Salisbury, about the 2018 novichok poisonings The Serpent, about backpacker killer Charles Sobhraj and Honour, about the real-life “honour killing” of 20-year-old Londoner Banaz Mahmod.MHStep inside Aria Wells’s incense-smoked flat in south London and you immediately get a waft of her character: there are mini-shrines of candles and trinkets from her travels to Mexico, India and Peru on practically every surface one wall is plastered with posters of Hindu gods to match the Om symbol tattooed between her eyebrows a tiny kitten named after the dancehall musician Buju Banton skitters across the floor. “Everything I do, I need to find a ritual in it,” she says, lighting a nub of palo santo. “It’s got to be magic.”There is certainly something cosmic about her ascent. The 25-year-old singer performs as Greentea Peng, so named because she’s a fan of green tea and the word “peng” (peng is slang for something that’s attractive, or a type of “high-grade weed”), and her rise to hot tip for 2020 has been swift yet effortless. In just one year, she has gone from working behind the bar of an east London club to supporting Neneh Cherry on tour and working with Goldie and Mike Skinner.Her tracks Mr Sun (Miss da Sun) and Downers seem to capture a mood: sad summertime soul that suggests a more bohemian Amy Winehouse and a Lahndahn Lauryn Hill. “I definitely feel like a London artist,” she says, having moved back to the capital from Kent in her late teens. “The bleakness of it in the winter brings out something in me.” Downers, in particular, evokes the isolation of the city and how you can “numb yourself to your surroundings too much”.When we meet, it’s UK election day and Wells had just put a spoken-word “rant” called Bun Boris on YouTube. She says the next song she releases will be political, too, aiming to “spark questions in people’s brains” – though her lyrics tend to be searching and introspective rather than didactic. “A lot of music is all materialistic,” she says. “One of the reasons why we’re in such a crisis with our young people is that our priorities are warped.”Some have called her music spiritual, which Wells doesn’t necessarily agree with, but it’s clear that she is looking for a higher purpose. Her latest ink is a spiral on her cheek, representing “the journey from ignorance to enlightenment” and an eye on her “throat chakra”, so placed “to make sure I always sing and remind me to communicate truthfully”. Which is handy, as she’ll be doing far more of it in 2020. Magical, indeed.Kate Hutchinson2020 is another sensational year for art. Three cult artists get their full due at London’s Royal Academy – shadowy night painter Léon Spilliaert, fantastical illustrator Aubrey Beardsley, charismatic performance artist Marina Abramović, filling the entire RA with her provocations and spells. Dürer, Raphael and Titian all get huge surveys at London’s National Gallery, along with Cézanne (RA) and Warhol (Tate Modern). The balance continues to adjust with much-anticipated retrospectives of the artists Angelica Kauffman (RA), Magdalena Abakanowicz (Tate Modern), Zanele Muholi (Tate Modern) and Haegue Yang (Tate St Ives).But the show of the year, at the National Gallery, has to be the greatest heroine of them all – Artemisia Gentileschi, Italian baroque painter, precocious successor to Caravaggio, self-reliant traveller and sometime visitor to London. Courageous witness against her rapist in court, Gentileschi painted some of the strongest women in art – defiant victims, fiery warriors, and herself in different guises. Her speciality was the story of Judith beheading the Assyrian general Holofernes, who was about to destroy her city. This will be a lightning strike of a show – and, amazingly, our first in this country.Laura Cumming This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Further up the scale, it was found that Nigeria emits 0.49 tonnes of carbon per person every year while in India the figure is 1.68. These figures compare with a global average of 4.7 tonnes per person per year. In Britain the figure is 8.3.Danny Sriskandarajah, the chief executive of Oxfam GB, described the scale of global inequality revealed by the study as staggering. “It’s a shock to realise that in just a few days our high-carbon lifestyles here in the UK produce the same emissions as the annual footprint of people in some poor countries. However, the encouraging thing is the willingness of the British public to take action.”“Just as large numbers of the public are resolving to reduce their carbon footprint, we need a bold new year’s resolution from the prime minister to get us on track to net-zero emissions much earlier than the current 2050 deadline,” added Sriskandarajah. “As the UK government gets ready to host global climate talks later this year, it needs to show that it is deadly serious about leading the fight against climate change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67891607d2ea204df2472095b1858559f8acf0e3/0_196_4843_2905/master/4843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=226302c07b1fa16fda266033e8d7c311","title":"electric cars environment hazards pedestrians","story":"They are symbols of environmental friendliness, but electric cars could be making environments increasingly unfriendly to pedestrians. Inaudible engines and obstructive charging systems are putting people with disabilities or pushchairs at risk, according to road safety campaigners who say that pedestrians are paying a hidden price for the green revolution.Dave Taylor, a resident in the London Borough of Ealing, contacted the Observer after reading an article on charging electric vehicles. “My photo of the car with the charging cable across the pavement highlights a very real issue that is not being addressed,” he says.“I recently contacted my local authority about a dangerously trailing cable and was told safety is the responsibility of the inidual driver, not the charging point provider or the council, even though local authorities are the responsible body for public health and safety.“The industry benchmark is that vehicles should be parked adjacent to the charging point but Ealing says if they were to introduce dedicated bays, resident permit holders would offer resistance to losing space.”Motorists can charge their vehicles on- or off-road from points in their homes, or from the growing number of publicly available installations.Ealing Council told the Observer that it was in the process of updating its website to make it clear that cables should not be extended across footways from home and said its 183 communal charge points were fitted with short cables to prevent them from becoming a trip hazard.However, the photograph of a street in the borough supplied by Taylor shows a cable trailing several feet along the kerb to a car parked further down the street.“If someone were to trip and suffer an injury it would be up to them to pursue the person who plugged it in through litigation. Pretty difficult and costly,” he says. “Councils are sidestepping responsibility.”Gaps in government guidelines mean that there are no specific restrictions on how and where vehicles can be charged in public spaces. The Department for Transport told the Observer that the safety of all road users was a priority, but its guidance for drivers and councils only addresses the technical and funding issues of charge points, with no word on the needs of other road users.Responsibility for maintaining safe environments falls to councils, which can potentially impose £100 fixed penalties for wilfully obstructing the highway or depositing things which cause injury or danger.A number of local authorities are themselves contributing to the problem by installing bulky charge points on pavements, squeezing out pedestrians to free up road space for traffic and avoid antagonising parking permit holders. While some charge points do come with dedicated parking bays, many are designed to provide what Ealing calls “flexibility”. Flexibility, that is, for drivers who can park in any available slot – or even on pavements – and extend the cable along the footway to reach their car.Government grants for domestic charge points are only available to homeowners with off-street parking and, to encourage demand, councils are under growing pressure to provide urban households with on-street facilities.The Office for Low Emission Vehicles has made £4.5m available to councils for 2019-20 and, amid the rush to claim a share, the charity Living Streets has launched a campaign to protect footways from being sacrificed for the benefit of drivers. Its website provides template letters to raise concerns with local councils.“If the vision is that we all move towards electric vehicles in the future, then there is the potential for cables to be trailing from every home across every pavement,” says Living Streets’ Kathryn Shaw. “We need to get this right, or we’ll be stuck forever with unsuitable and dangerous infrastructure.”The charity is calling for charging points to be installed in car parks or off pavements and also wants the government to follow Scotland’s lead in banning any parking on pavements from 2021.And as the adoption of electric vehicles rises year on year, their soundless motors can pose problems for pedestrians, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. Since July, all new prototypes must emit a noise before being approved in Europe, but there is no such requirement for the estimated 255,000 now on British roads, or models currently being manufactured. Helen Honstvet of the charity Guide Dogs says: “We are concerned that the roll-out of sound generators, in line with the EU regulations, is not happening quickly enough – sound generators are only required on new models, whereas they should be compulsory on all new electric cars and drivers should face consequences if they fail to maintain an audible warning system.”David Bailey, a professor at Birmingham Business School and the driver of his own Nissan Leaf electric car, says that while the UK’s charging infrastructure needs investment, electric cars are not going away.“It’s quite the opposite – 2020 is going to see a big rise in electric car sales across Europe as car manufacturers face heavy penalties if the average carbon dioxide emissions from all the cars they sell is above 95g per kilometre. By mid-2020, electric cars are expected to match combustion-engined cars in terms of price and ease of use. While the UK still lags behind some European countries – particularly for fast chargers – we will simply have to sort out the charging infrastructure to match the numbers being driven,” he says.Not everyone is so sure. Shaw is adamant we should be focusing on other ways to get around. “Electric vehicles do not solve congestion or all our air-quality problems – the suggestion they do is incredibly misleading,” she says. “Fundamentally, we need to change the way we travel. The new government needs to prioritise active travel to tackle unacceptable road danger, climate change, toxic levels of air pollution and the health crisis due to sedentary lifestyles.“Our towns and cities should be places where walking is the natural choice for local, every-day journeys and blocking up pavements with EV charging points and cables flies in the face of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bac68f3f5ffea147d3f6f7a90a53de9ad350e5f/0_0_3612_2200/master/3612.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c29f0594b49e40366050d2948da05069 1760w","title":"rupert everett desert island discs brexit tension mother","story":"Rupert Everett, actor, director, author and staunch Remainer, has described the tensions of sharing a home with his 85-year-old Brexiter mother. Appearing as the guest on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs on Sunday he confesses that both of them are set in their ways, and that this causes “a certain amount of friction”.The 60-year-old also reveals that, despite now living quietly like a “kind of country blob”, with his mother, partner and dog, he suspects he will never give up acting. “It is very difficult to let go,” he admits.Everett found fame aged 22 in Another Country, the Julian Mitchell play based on the life of spy Guy Burgess, also made into a film co-starring Colin Firth. He went on to enjoy “flash in the pan” Hollywood status, co-starring in films with Miranda Richardson, Julia Roberts, Madonna and even an orangutan (in Dunston Checks In), before his career foundered.“Success has come to me both too early and too late,” he tells host Lauren Laverne. “I would have preferred it to have come in the middle, in a more normal way, but anyway, it comes when it comes.”The “incredible ambience” created during rehearsals for a play, for Everett, remains an old-fashioned pleasure. “Rehearsing is rather like post offices, or something,” he says. “It is a form of communication that has more or less disappeared.” The actor is currently rehearsing in New York for a new Broadway production of Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?.Choosing musical tracks that range from Wagner to Stormzy, via the work of his own “household gods”, Pet Shop Boys, Everett rejects Laverne’s standard offer of a copy of the bible for his island castaway experience and selects Graham Greene’s Travels With My Aunt as his preferred reading matter. His choice of luxury is a selection of “decent vegetables” to eat.The actor tells Laverne he inevitably grew up to have a “generally frosty,” slightly distant personality after the “heartbreaking experience” of being sent to boarding school at the age of seven. “It cauterises some emotional thing,” he says. “I think these schools were made for empire because they calcified the hearts of the empire rulers. They would never be as hurt again as they were hurt by the abandonment of their parents.”As a child he had wanted to be a girl, he says, and adored his mother, his aunt and his grandmother. “I didn’t trust men. All the men in my family went sailing or they played golf – two things I found unutterably grim. I loved necklaces and bras and nestling up to my mum.”He embraced homosexuality after leaving school at 16 to move to London and learn to act. Coming out as gay, he says, helped him overcome his family’s “regimented, militaristic” background. “Every shag, I felt at the time, was knocking that down and destroying it. I felt I had lost myself from my own previous life.”He regards himself lucky not to have contracted HIV and says that losing friends to the illness meant that he became difficult to work with. “I was on a short fuse. I was a very jaggedy, strange freak.”Oscar Wilde, always a favourite writer for Everett, brought him renewed success in 2018 when he directed and starred in The Happy Prince, his own screenplay about the playwright’s later life, The mystery is, Everett suggests to Laverne, why it took him so long to take up writing professionally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffbcc3b9e301207a7c4364bec9363f032c607e2a/0_202_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99f6120960d001d8044ffc7f167c2f37","title":"new year new wines three to try in 2020","story":"Start the year with wines that are a change from your usual tippleComtesse Saint Hilaire Montagne Saint Emilion, Bordeaux, France 2018 (£10, The Co-op) For many red wine drinkers, Argentine malbec has become a default choice. The seductive combination of velvety tannins, plummy fruit and chocolatey seductiveness, such as in Dominio del Plata Terroir Series Malbec, Uco Valley 2017 (£12, M\u0026ampS), is hard to overlook. For those enchanted by malbec but looking to broaden their horizons, a logical next step would be to France, where the variety originated. First, maybe a malbec made in the different conditions of the Cahors appellation, such as Georges Vigouroux Pigmentum Malbec 2018 (£12.95, Great Western Wine). Then, on to Bordeaux, where malbec is now more of a rarity, but where the style of a merlot-based red blend from Montagne St-Emilion has a similar succulent appeal.Lafazanis Geometria Malagouzia, Peloponnese, Greece 2018 (£10.95, The Wine Society) In terms of popularity, sauvignon blanc is malbec’s white equivalent, and the number of similar examples on offer at any given supermarket has ballooned in recent years. I’ve nothing against good New Zealand sauvignon blanc: a classic of the genre such as the pristine Framingham Sauvignon Blanc, Marlborough 2018 (£14.99, Noel Young) has a limey citrus zing and joys of spring verdancy that is very hard to resist. But the style doesn’t have the monopoly on that mix of aromatic intensity and unoaked fruity vibrancy. For a change that is better than a rest, Greek whites often do a similar thing, but with a different cast of flavours, not least in Lafazanis’s superb take on Greece’s malagouzia variety, with its mouthfilling peachy juiciness balanced with lively citrus and minerals.Follow David on Twitter @Daveydaibach This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

EH7 5AA (0131 322 1246). Lunchtime à la carte: starters £8-£14 mains £16-£25 desserts £5 wines from £29. Set lunch £25. Evening tasting menus £50 and £70The Lookout is a brave restaurant. It hasn’t so much decided that passing trade is not a priority, as laughed in its face, then handed it a scribbled note saying, “Go away.” It occupies a new build right at the top of Calton Hill within the Observatory buildings, looking out over Edinburgh to the Firth of Forth, hence the name.Inside, it is drop-dead, look-at-me-I’m-Instagram-ready gorgeous, with floor-to-ceiling glass walls, polished concrete floors, a light well through a geometric funnel of a ceiling and an open kitchen with a fire grill, guaranteed to give any diners sitting within 10ft a nice cure. Outside it is toilet-block chic. It’s apparently been designed by an architect who, when asked for a contemporary design that might have something to say to the neoclassicism of the faux Athenian Acropolis that dominates up here, decided on the words, “Yeah, whatever.”Taxis can drop off, though it’s still a walk from the road. Otherwise, it’s a major yomp uphill because there’s no parking. No one would describe it as a model of accessibility. On a beautiful Edinburgh summer’s day when the sun barely bothers to set, this could be joyous. I go on a late November day, when half the North Sea is being deposited on the hilltop. I feel intrepid simply for getting to the door.There is one other challenge. In the evenings, like its sister restaurant, the Gardener’s Cottage at the bottom of the hill, it only serves a tasting menu. It’s £50 for five courses and £70 for seven. There’s quite a lot of this in Edinburgh right now. They do something similar at Timberyard and Six by Nico, the Table and Aizle and a few others beside. If they’re finding enough custom happy to have what they’re given, then good for them. But too often a tasting menu feels to me like double maths, only with fancy glasses and better-dressed teachers. It’s to be endured. And then paid for.That is the case for the prosecution. Here then is the defence: at lunchtime, when it’s a short à la carte, the Lookout is worth busting your lungs for. The view is spectacular, even when the cloud-base is descending on the city like a duvet being chucked over a bed, but you won’t look up much because the food is so erting. It is simple ideas, well executed, using great ingredients in the service of big flavours. Across our lunch everything feels thoughtful and thought out.Three fat rock oysters arrive. One is in a crisp, lacy tempura overcoat. The other two are unadorned, but come with a shell generously filled with their own XO sauce. It’s a deep rust colour, and rich with the profound savouriness of dried seafood and sugar and oils. I know I’m meant to put it on the oysters, and I do, but I also end up spooning it away neat, until I’m scraping at the mother-of-pearl. They come with a well-made sourdough and lick-the-plate-clean butter.There are just four choices for the first two courses. The star of our starters is a cuttlefish risotto made night-black from the ink. On top are the very freshest of cockles still in the shell, which are salty and sweet and bright. Cockles are the equal of any poularde clam, but most of them get ripped from their shells, pickled and sent away to people with more taste. We suck at the meat then use the shells to scoop away. There are a few bitter leaves on top wilting gently in the heat. By comparison a frothy bowl of pumpkin soup, the surface sprinkled with pumpkin seeds, seems almost demure. But glancing up at the rain slapping the glass like a cat demanding to be let in, this soup suddenly makes it feel as if the food and weather have been matched. Bouncing around in the bottom of the bowl are squeaky, fresh beechnuts. Both of these dishes are £8. It’s a lot for the soup, and very good value for the risotto.A chunk of pearly hake, the flakes sliding away from each other, sits atop an unmanicured mess of gently sautéed leeks, nutty new potatoes and melon-bellied mussels, which are a warming shade of tangerine. It is described as coming with “curry”, which in this case means the puddle of buttery broth bringing it all together has been spiced lightly with a garam masala.The darkness to this lightness is a perfectly grilled and glazed beef fillet, with roasted and charcoal-grilled pieces of Jerusalem artichoke. There’s also a jug of a luscious onion broth to pour over it all. We have been sniffing all this on the air for so long now it’s almost a relief to be eating it – for, while major extraction has been fitted, it really isn’t up to the job. Occasionally, they try opening the front door to let a little of the smoke out, but the weather is determined and angry. Get a table as near to a window as possible.Alongside, we have grilled and blackened hispi cabbage – I love acrylamide, me no really, I do – with dollops of Berkswell cheese, and more cheese grated over the top, plus pink fir potatoes still in their skins, first fried then roasted. Remember, this is Edinburgh on a dreich day. You will need something to sustain you on the trip down the hill. We finish with a slab of apple tart, made with chunks of fruit roasted to golden, and a whipped chocolate mousse, with booze-soaked prunes and a chocolate tuile. It’s not uncommon for strangers to tell me how jealous they are of what I do for a living. I tell them it’s a writing job not an eating job, and so on. But reading this back, even I’m jealous of me.Of course, there is a price, which is not helped by a short wine list that opens at £29 for a bottle of Moscatel and doesn’t loiter for long in the £30s. Two glasses of admittedly terrific Albariño come in at £27. With mains around the £20 mark the bill will build up quickly, though there is a no-choice three-course set lunch from Monday to Friday for £25. Think of it as high-altitude dining, with prices to match. And be prepared to put all your clothes in the wash the moment you get home. Taken in the round, however, I’d put it all in the column headed “Absolutely worth it.”It also takes effort to get to the Moorcock Inn, high on the moor at Sowerby Bridge, but it will be rewarded. Chef Alisdair Brooke-Taylor and his partner Aimee Turford, who runs front of house, walk the line between generous boozer and cutting-edge restaurant. The pub menu might include baked sea bass or a game terrine with pickles the restaurant tasting menu, a snip at £39 for nine dishes each, heads off towards crab with creamed corn and fermented mushrooms and celeriac with goat ricotta (themoorcock)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a93ff10811472fb015bbf9f4956e6327f7333a6b/0_246_4336_2602/master/4336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee4875bd6e41df1d2d803b7b2df3f39f","title":"michail antonio west ham united fa cup gang culture","story":"“I had a short temper growing up,” Michail Antonio says. “When I was younger, from primary school to 14, you just needed to call me a dickhead and I’d have a fight with you. A physical fight. I don’t know why.”An angry Antonio is difficult to picture. From afar the West Ham forward seems the happy type, a cult hero who always has a funny goal celebration up his sleeve, and this 29-year-old father of three does not disappoint when we meet at Football Beyond Borders’ office in Brixton. Antonio has given up his Thursday evening to support FBB, an education charity that uses the power of football to support disadvantaged young people in the United Kingdom, and it does not take long to understand how much community means to him.Antonio is from south London and he looks a natural while mentoring a group of boys who have struggled at school and are here because FBB has teamed up with the Wellness Project, a homelessness charity, to provide care packages for young people living on the streets during Christmas. “They remind me of my school days,” he says. “Growing up in south London you are naturally quite boisterous.”“I get a call the next day saying everyone’s saying I stole the bike. I had to go down to the police station, explain everything. The guy who stole the bike was short and fat with canerows. I was skinny with no hair. Obviously I still had to go because five or six people said it was me and they were meant to be my friends.“The next day I go to school angry, squaring up to everybody. I went to the last person and he’s gone: ‘Do you wanna fight me?’ I’m about to lose my head and his hand reaches into his bag. I’m running at him, my nephew pulls me back. I find out within an hour the guy had a knife. I’m about to fight this guy and he might have stabbed me. From there I’ve just been the calmest person there is.”Not every child achieves that clarity. Antonio knows about gang culture and he despairs at the recent rise in knife crime in London, arguing that the young are being failed by the people in power. “It’s 10 times worse than when I was growing up,” he says. “We’ve completely lost touch of how we need to treat kids. London is becoming more of a business than a place for families. You can’t live here. We’re not investing in the future.“Everyone’s trying to buy a house. Everything’s turned into business blocks. There’s hardly any parks any more. Every little space of green is turned into flats. Kids will always be there. People who are businessmen and women will turn into family. So what about kids coming up now? There is nothing for them to do.”Antonio, who was unhurt in a Christmas Day car crash, had it different. He buzzes when he remembers his childhood, which was mainly spent playing football. He loved going to youth centres or adventure playgrounds. He remembers the tuck shop. He remembers playing table tennis, pool and PlayStation. Above all, he remembers making friends. And now? “They’re all shut down or you have to pay for them and people can’t afford it any more,” Antonio says. “This is the first time I’ve played the blame game. I’m blaming the government for shutting down all these youth centres and adventure playgrounds.“Kids now wouldn’t know about youth centres. I just feel if they had the opportunity to do that they wouldn’t be on the side of the street trying to cause chaos. But when you’re bored you just try to do things and half the time it is mischievous.”This is where charities such as FBB have an impact. The goal is to show kids another way, to lead them down a better path, and Antonio is proof that dedication pays off. It all began for him in non-league football, with Tooting \u0026amp Mitcham, and he remembers his father worrying about his future. “I was turning 16 and asking him for money,” he says. “He was like: ‘You’re old enough to work now.’ ‘Yeah, I’ll play football.’ ‘That’s not a job.’” A cheeky smile. “I went to my mum and she’d give me the money.”Antonio’s elder brother urged him to stick at it. He worked his way up the ladder, starting with Reading, and West Ham were smart to sign him for £7m from Nottingham Forest in 2015. Antonio is unpolished but Premier League defenders hate playing against his speed and strength.West Ham, who visit Gillingham in the FA Cup on Sunday, are on a bad run and have replaced Manuel Pellegrini with David Moyes. “This is my fifth season and every year we hit a blip,” Antonio says. “But then after that we pick up and go again. I just feel it should be a bit tighter as a team.”Antonio’s respect for his brother is obvious. “He’s the first person I speak to for advice,” he says. “There was the time when I thought about joining a gang. When you’re young and the girls are attracted to the bad boys, the bad boys had all the money. I didn’t have much so I wanted to attract that. But my brother was like: ‘Why would you join one gang when you know someone in that other gang? You’ll have to fight your own friends.’ That happened two months after that discussion. One of my friends stabbed another friend. He died.”For Antonio, the key is a close support network. He remembers a teacher at Southfields, Mr Holt, who always stuck up for him when he was in trouble. The reality, though, is that not every child can count on that safety net. What happens then?“He gets kicked out of school and you can never tell what he’s going to be,” Antonio says. “When I was younger there were kids who got kicked out of school and ended up selling drugs and ended up in prison. There are other kids who got kicked out and they managed to make their own career.“These charities and social events help these kids shape their personality and realise that distracting the class or having a short temper is just unnecessary. Life is a results game. You turn up late for work four or five times, you get sacked. It’s doing the right things and that’s one thing I’ve learned about life. Everything is about results.”Michail Antonio was speaking at a Football Beyond Borders event in partnership with Unique Sports Management, aiming to support 1,000 young people back into education in 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c46efc215ecdf93374781bde243f04fb9abc3a94/0_146_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=922bb19ab0df5db1d41fa8d9b07a982d","title":"ancelotti klopp everton liverpool fa cup third round preview","story":"Everton have not won at Anfield since 1999 but new manager hopes his record will tell against Liverpool in third-round tieCarlo Ancelotti has a much better record in the FA Cup than Jürgen Klopp, despite spending only two seasons in England to the Liverpool manager’s four. Chelsea went all the way in Ancelotti’s first season at Stamford Bridge, winning at Wembley to leave the Italian newcomer with an impressive league and Cup Double, and, though they were knocked out by Everton in the fourth round the following year, they had already completed a 7-0 rout of Ipswich in the third.It is fair to say that Klopp’s FA Cup career thus far has never hit any of those heights. His Liverpool side have made third- or fourth-round exits in each of his four excursions into the competition, the only three teams Klopp has succeeded in beating in the Cup are Exeter, Plymouth and, er, Everton, and last year, when Liverpool went out in the third round at Wolves, the manager faced criticism for fielding a much-changed side featuring three teenagers making their debuts.This may amount to only the thinnest of straws for Everton to clutch at as they prepare for Sunday’s Merseyside derby at Anfield, but when Ancelotti vowed to “fight for the FA Cup” on his first day at Goodison at least it did not sound like an empty promise.The new Everton manager knew full well that he could not have been handed a tougher third-round tie, with Liverpool now champions of the world as well as Premier League leaders and their rivals winless at Anfield since the days of Walter Smith and Kevin Campbell in 1999. Yet at minimum there is reason to believe the gulf between the two neighbours might have narrowed a little since the abject 5-2 thrashing at the start of last month that signalled the end of Marco Silva’s time in charge.Few Everton players have anything bad to say about Silva, either now or when he was still manager, yet many are prepared to admit the transformation in outlook over the last month has been quite startling. First Duncan Ferguson did what Silva was apparently incapable of doing, injecting some passion and urgency into performances to help restore lost pride and improve morale.Then in Ancelotti Everton found themselves with a coaching appointment they would barely have dared dream of a few months earlier. Not only has the Italian won more FA Cups than Klopp, he has won more Champions Leagues, for goodness sake. Elite managers do not generally do the tour of Milan, Madrid, Munich, Paris and London then end up on the underachieving side of Stanley Park.While it is much too early to judge whether Everton’s bold coup will deliver the desired success, in the short term at least there is a belief within the squad at the moment that was hard to discern even a few weeks ago. “We were in a dark place the last time we went to Anfield,” is how one player puts it. “Everything seems much brighter now.”Everything is relative, however, and the fact remains that for Liverpool at present the future is so bright supporters are practically wearing shades. Klopp did his usual amount of complaining about the festive fixture overload – not without reason – then proceeded to collect nine points from a possible nine over the holiday period. No one else in the Premier League could match that, and Everton’s best policy might be to ignore the daunting statistics building up over Liverpool’s imperious league form and hope Klopp continues to treat the FA Cup lightly.While he does have a long list of injuries and some tired first-team regulars, and clearly intimated after beating Sheffield United he would prefer to make a few changes, the difficulty the German faces is to do with the derby dimension.Liverpool supporters would not shed too many tears over another early FA Cup exit if it left a clear run to a first league title in 30 years and perhaps even a third successive Champions League final. But they have no wish to see Everton prevail at Anfield and they would not appreciate Klopp making life easier for their rivals by resting key players in the way he did at Wolves last season.Yet the pattern established over the last few years has been for Liverpool to be a little blasé about the FA Cup, regarding it as an unofficial opportunity for a mid-season breather, and, though Klopp is aware of the sensitivities surrounding a local derby, there is still a feeling his team selection might be quite daring.As befits a manager who in his time at Napoli beat Klopp’s Liverpool this season and last, Ancelotti has remained admirably upbeat about the forthcoming encounter since arriving on Merseyside. “Nothing is impossible in football,” was his first message to Everton supporters. More recently he implored them to live for the present and not in the past, politely ignoring the fact that a considerable proportion of Everton followers are simply not old enough to live in the past. Now he is confirming that of course Everton have a chance at Anfield, as long as they put in a great performance. “Everything has to be perfect,” he stressed. “A normal performance will not be good enough.”He is right there: a normal Everton performance will certainly not be good enough, though due to the events of the last month or so no one is quite sure any longer what a normal Everton performance might be.It is Ancelotti’s duty to raise the spirits of players and supporters before such a big game, and to his credit he has succeeded in creating a little uncertainty about the outcome when history and statistics suggest there should be none.Currently being told by former Everton players left, right and centre which players he needs to buy this month, Ancelotti has sensibly put transfer business on a back burner until today’s game is out of the way. He has already supervised three league matches, not counting the one he watched from the stands against Arsenal, though for better or worse one feels this will be the moment Ancelotti’s Everton career gets properly under way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddbce2c0a49fa5860984af931c768e0d4d383dd9/0_121_3622_2173/master/3622.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90b5f5a89ebb90549af3b31d75e41dbf","title":"manchester united wolves adama traore fa cup juan mata","story":"“You’re not famous any more,” sang the home fans in the Jack Hayward Stand, but that isn’t really true. Manchester United are still famous, it’s just not for the same thing any more. Once, as Steve Bull observed at half-time, Wolves would have feared United, but no longer. There was at least a semblance of pattern here, at least until they got into the final third, but unless they get an early goal and can counter, United rarely look like blowing opponents away.Once United wore red shirts that for more than 100 years had symbolised passion and attacking flair, a club that believed in doing things the right way. Here they wore black with orange detail, because they are a brand, far more adept at selling merchandise and growing their social media following than any of that dull 20th-century stuff like putting together a football team.Once they were renowned for their astuteness in signing and promoting youth, a facet always near the surface when they meet Wolves, given how they enticed Duncan Edwards from the Midlands. Perhaps it’s because they’ve promoted youth so successfully that the youths are now the players they rest for Cup games, but here it was Wolves’ youngsters, Pedro Neto in particular, who looked the more promising. Not that there was a huge amount of promise on either side. This was not a good game, one of those disjointed occasions that so often characterise the early rounds of the Cup when both teams field half-and-half sides.Although there were seven changes from the United team that lost so dismally at Arsenal on Wednesday, the sense was of a team selected with the aim of protecting Marcus Rashford and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, both of whom began on the bench. In the end, Rashford had to be called upon with 21 minutes remaining. He hit the bar immediately but that was a rare opportunity in anther drab display.It says much for the abject way in which United’s squad has been put together that the decision to rest Fred, coupled with the injuries to Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay, left them fielding both Nemanja Matic and Juan Mata in midfield. That might have been a reasonable prospect at Chelsea at the beginning of the last decade – although Mata’s time at the club came between Matic’s two spells there – but here it felt a little like using a Nokia 3310 in an era of smartphones. Sure, it can make a call, or ghost a free-kick just wide, but the result, hardly surprisingly, was that whenever a Wolves player got a run at them – and with Adama Traoré, Neto and the 21-year-old Benny Ashley‑Seal, Wolves had plenty of runners – there was danger.Traoré remains a gloriously unlikely figure, somebody whose bustling running style offers a perpetual reminder that the Argentinian verb for dribbling – gambetar – is derived from a gaucho term for the gait of the ostrich. This ostrich, though, is one that bears on its trim legs the upper body of a rugby league forward. Neto, a 19-year-old summer acquisition from Braga, is quick and a fine crosser with his left foot, but has the technical skills that Nuno Espírito Santo thinks his future may lie through the middle as a No 10. Ashley-Seal, making his first senior start for the club, was far from overawed against two central defenders with 59 international caps between them, even if there was little sign of the finishing ability that brought him a hat-trick against Carlisle in the EFL Trophy before he was withdrawn at half-time for the more proven figure of Raúl Jiménez.United may have had more possession than most away sides at Molineux, at least before half-time, but that is a mixed blessing for a team that is at its best when playing on the break and frequently seems to lack the wherewithal to unpick well-drilled defences. No shots on target is a damning statistic.Wolves played with a zip and sense of purpose United lacked and had far more in the way of clear chances. Perhaps that’s what you’d expect from a game between seventh and fifth in the league, even with all the changes, but those home fans were right: this is worryingly far from the old United."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/637ee5f448be13a88c580305af12d9ad22db657f/121_0_4417_2651/master/4417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a925f18434c06e7e408ec3d71bfc6e0c","title":"fa cup third round magic birmingham blackburn","story":"Most match days, you can barely squeeze into the bar of the Royal George Hotel at the north-eastern corner of St Andrew’s. An hour before Birmingham play Blackburn, however, there are still plenty of chairs and tables available. A short distance away, in front of the Tilton Road Stand, a lone steward stands solemn guard in front of a bank of silent turnstiles. The magic of the FA Cup is still very much in evidence, it seems – but these days it tends to be more of a vanishing act.It’s a similar story inside the stadium, where only one of the four stands – the Kop – is fully open, along with a sliver of away fans in the Gil Merrick. This despite Blackburn bringing a healthy away contingent and tickets being attractively priced at £12. Birmingham’s Twitter account was still trying to flog them early on Saturday morning.“Good luck with that,” one fan replied. “Got a new pack of batteries I want to lick,” said another. A third respondent simply posted a gif of a man bashing himself in the head with a rock hammer.If this seems like something of a shame, given these are two of England’s most venerable clubs with 10 FA Cup final appearances and 27 semi-finals between them, then perhaps we should scarcely be surprised either. The home side are currently fighting relegation from the Championship, while the visitors still have a decent shot at making the play-offs. An exhausting festive period, when these sides played each other on Boxing Day, has taken its toll. The game was moved to a lunchtime kick-off for overseas television (presumably in North Korea). You could scarcely concoct a less romantic set of circumstances if you tried.The problem is that for all the pleasing randomness of the FA Cup, the A-list collisions and potential giant-killings that make its reputation are vanishingly rare. Of the 32 third-round ties, only half a dozen offer the genuine peril of a Premier League side playing a team two or more isions below.Ultimately, the competition’s lifeblood is ties like Birmingham v Blackburn. And if public engagement is anything to go by, there’s trouble ahead. Before the game, Birmingham’s struggling manager, Pep Clotet, was asked how much importance he placed on the FA Cup. The Spaniard pondered his answer for a full six seconds. “It’s an official game for the club,” he eventually said.To be fair to them, neither Clotet nor his opposite number, Tony Mowbray, treated the fixture with outright disdain. Blackburn made three changes, one of which was enforced by injury. Birmingham made seven, but with the returning Jake Clarke-Salter still fielded a reasonably strong side. They even made a dream start, Dan Crowley scoring a brilliant solo goal after running unchallenged from the halfway line.Slowly though Blackburn came back into it with Sam Gallagher missing an increasingly comical series of chances. On the hour, the Birmingham substitute Ivan Sunjic hauled him down as he bore down on goal, earning himself a red card and a penalty: not bad for a player who had been on the field for barely two minutes. As Adam Armstrong equalised, and the dreaded spectre of a replay presented itself, the game gave way to lawless chaos.With seconds remaining, Birmingham’s 10 men broke. Blackburn took an age to organise and Jérémie Bela squeezed home an unlikely winner from a tight angle.A despondent Mowbray was the first man down the tunnel after the final whistle. “I grew up in an era where you respected the FA Cup,” he said. “It was the biggest day of the year in our family. But that’s our fifth game in 13 days. It’s easy to sit and talk about disrespecting the Cup. But footballers aren’t machines.”For Birmingham, meanwhile, unconfined jubilation. The attendance of 7,330 was the lowest here since 2016 and the lowest in the FA Cup since 1990. But as the players stayed on after the final whistle to applaud all one and a half sides of the ground, it was possible to speculate that even in the drudgery of an FA Cup third‑round tie nobody wanted to watch, it was still possible to find a little joy. You just needed to know where to look."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/145e2056586c63ac20f120ec12b23e2b9951a70f/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd5e58975563e5c54bc32b6180cf63c4","title":"liberia palm oil miracle farmers empty promises","story":"Palm plantations are fuelling a booming international trade but the people who live on its edges feel forgotten The sign at the entrance to the palm oil plantation in Grand Bassa has faded thanks to Liberia’s relentless cycle of scorching sun and torrential rain. Even so, it’s possible to make out the phrase: “Your community is rich: Let’s have a fair share.”Several miles farther on, past endless rows of carefully cultivated palm trees, it’s a slogan that bears little relation to reality. Gbenee Town is a small huddle of huts surrounded by a plantation more than six times the size of London’s Richmond Park.The townspeople say that the benefits of the plantation’s expansion have passed them by and they have been duped by a government that took the land they were living off and gave it to foreign investors.“The level we’re living here is very deplorable,” says G Hilary Gbah, one of the town’s elders. “We are starving to death.”Gbah, 54, remembers the arrival in 2012 of Equatorial Palm Oil, the London-headquartered company that owns the plantation. “We embraced the company because we wanted development,” he says, remembering the promises of schools and clinics if local people gave up land.“We were expecting education for our children, employment, healthcare.”He still has a dog-eared list distributed by Liberia’s government. It promised huge rewards if farmers agreed to the clearance of their land, at fixed amounts per plant for crops such as rubber and cassava. “They came and encouraged us … that if we gave them the land then they were going to develop it, all the crops that we had on the land they were going to pay good prices.” People talk of receiving $100 or less for the clearance of crops that could have sustained them for life. The clinics and schools never materialised. One local expert on community compensation, who asked not to be named, said the prices – promised by the government rather than the company – were always wildly unrealistic.But those in nearby communities such as Blayah Town say they had no reason to doubt what they had been told. “They only fooled us and took our land,” says Gbah.Now farmers who once grew their own crops rely on charity or the offer of work from friends in neighbouring towns.The palm oil industry, meanwhile, is thriving. Oil milled from palm fruit is something of a miracle product that has become indispensable to billions of consumers around the world, spawning $60bn industry that continues to grow. Palm oil is found in everything from chocolate to bread, cereal and shampoo. It keeps crisps crispy and stops ice-cream from melting. There is a global process designed to promote ethics in the industry – the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) – but it has limited power to effect change.Around the world palm oil continues to play a significant role in deforestation, threatening wildlife and fuelling the climate crisis. In rural Liberia, one of the world’s poorest countries, the immediate concern is the impact that the industry’s appetite for land is having on the people who live here.For many people in Gbenee and nearby towns, land is the only thing of value that they have. Those who have given up their land, even after compensation offers were drastically reduced, say they did so for one reason alone: fear.In communities from Blayah Town to Qwarkpojlian and Paye Town, elders and women’s representatives recount a similar story.When EPO arrived in 2012 to survey the land it had been awarded by the government, local people concerned that they had not been consulted gathered to protest. The company’s representatives were accompanied by an armed police unit, a terrifying sight in a country still recovering from civil wars that left hundreds of thousands dead.“Since the war finished in Liberia, that was the first day to see arms,” said Garamondeh Banwun. “We were afraid.” Banwun, like many people here, reports beatings handed out by police, some of whom – it is claimed – rode in EPO vehicles.The company is keen to expand further in Grand Bassa but communities that were once open to development no longer trust the process to improve their lives. The alleged role of Liberia’s underesourced state in this dynamic is crucial.But the companies involved are struggling to develop in a way that benefits those whose ancestral land has been sold from beneath them.Historically, few of these communities have been included in the proper consultation process that advocacy groups refer to as free, prior and informed consent (FPIC). James Otto represents the Sustainable Development Institute (SDI), a non-governmental organisation based in Liberia’s capital Monrovia with strong ties to palm oil communities.“Companies continue to knowingly rob communities of their land and forest resources to their disadvantage – posing serious threats to their livelihoods and living spaces,” says Otto.SDI wants communities to be properly consulted over the benefits they will receive – such as schools, clinics and employment – and is calling for signed memorandums of understanding. “Consistent failure of oil palm companies including EPO to fulfil their social and environmental commitments continues to weaken the trust of communities and has dented the opportunities of communities for development,” he says.“Financiers of oil palm companies should ensure that the companies are in compliance with FPIC, respect labour rights and environmental standards.”EPO, however, is not certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. SDI and the communities in Grand Bassa are not inherently opposed to the palm industry, which has the power to create jobs and help develop infrastructure. And there has been at least some progress in ensuring that communities have more robust powers to protect themselves.The Land Rights Act, which was passed last year, is key to that effort. It gives communities ownership of ancestral lands, allowing them to make demands of firms that want to exploit it. But it does not apply retroactively and, in a country with limited state presence, there are lingering doubts about whether it leads to the desired outcomes.In some cases, the new law is having unintended consequences. A hundred miles south-east of Grand Bassa, down a mud-bath of a road lined with the rusting hulks of broken-down cars and trucks – lies the town of Shampee in Sinoe County. Here, EPO did bring benefits: employment and much-needed schools and clinics, staffed by teachers and nurses paid by the company.But a protracted land dispute between neighbouring communities has deterred the company from further investment. Earlier this year it announced plans to pull out.Like many of the staff in the clinic and school, midwife Caroline Weah was a contractor. She has worked in the company’s clinic for six years but has limited redundancy rights. What’s more, she says the company began slowing supplies to the clinic months ago.“They usually gave us drugs every quarter,” she says. “From July we don’t have medicine so the patient load starts going down. Right now, no medicine. Somebody come, If I assess what they need, I don’t have it. I give them prescription and they’re not able to afford to buy.”“What will become of the pregnant women and the children?”EPO’s departure appears to have hit Shampee as hard as its arrival in Gbenee.Such cases have convinced SDI that Liberia would be better off with smaller community-run plantations that could supply multinational firms’ thirst for palm oil and put the wealth into the community. This model, says Otto, is the “only hope for prosperity and development that recognises rights and protects the environment”.Traidcraft Exchange, a UK-based campaign group, wants to see pressure applied through legal safeguards in markets such as the UK where demand for palm oil is created. “Things would have been very different if EPO had been required to consider the impact of these big land deals on local people,” said senior policy adviser Tom Wills. “That’s why Traidcraft Exchange and others are calling for new legislation that would make UK companies assess what risks they pose to human rights, and hold them to account in the courts for any abuses.”Equatorial Palm Oil is listed on London’s Alternative Investment Market (Aim). Its ultimate majority owner is Malaysian firm Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad.EPO declined to comment on the record. However, the company indicated that allegations about its role in violence by state police dated from some time ago. It also said it had been working hard to build consensus with local communities and indicated that the Liberian government had agreed to assume responsibility for the clinic in Shampee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/211c1dc050c6e122e5daf5abb434ed04ca3b777e/0_281_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7d5678d691cd7afa546191226478a8e","title":"astronaut helen sharman this much i know","story":"The astronaut, 56, on self-belief, G-force – and being the only girl in science classAlmost everything about my childhood was normal and mundane.

The sun is moving, but not yet the temperature, though welcome frost will break up heavy soil.Try to keep off wet ground to avoid compacting it, but think about seed potatoes. This is the month to order your choices and lay them out in trays to chit. First earlies should be ready for planting in mid-March in warmer areas, but leave it until later where it is cooler. Look out for nearby potato fairs (potato-days.net) where you can also buy onion sets and shallots for planting in the coming months. Reacquaint yourself with a good garden centre.Order seed this month to avoid missing out on more interesting varieties. Support small suppliers if you can organic if possible. You can maybe start off hardier seed in a propagator, or sow late-winter leaves if you have a cold frame.January is the time of the ‘hunger gap’, though kales and chards should still be good, and oriental leaves in more sheltered spots. Chicories, too – you can ‘force’ some styles now if you like the same with well-established rhubarb sets. Cauliflowers should soon be ready and sprouting broccoli will start coming this month.Think about preparing new beds for the growing season, but avoid digging frozen soil. You can prune any apple and pear trees on warmer days without frost, but leave stone fruits such as plums until the summer. Compost any scattered leaves lying around and start hoeing new weeds while they are small.I had thought at first to say there is not much to do to advise you to relax, luxuriate, plan your plot – so think about doing that, too.Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

But employers warn that the decline in teenage part-time work is leaving many unprepared for the realities of working life.“This lack of work experience can create longer-term problems, particularly if they hit other life milestones or ill-health before their careers have got off the ground,” said Laura Gardiner, the Resolution Foundation’s research director.Many of the UK’s most successful people have spoken publicly about their Saturday jobs the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, toiled on a building site, the entrepreneur Karen Brady worked in a hair salon and the broadcaster Robert Peston cleaned freezers in a frozen food shop. The jobs that 16- and 17-year-olds are most likely to undertake include waiting tables, helping in restaurant and hotel kitchens and working as shop assistants.“School leavers and university graduates coming into the workplace too often lack key skills like resilience, team working and general awareness of appropriate workplace behaviour,” said Amy Leonard, the chief executive of the Transformation Trust, which helps disadvantaged teenagers get into work. “Particularly with young people from socio-economically disadvantaged areas, it’s not just about developing the right skills, it’s about demystifying the world of work and helping them to develop the confidence to take that next step from education into work.”Almost half of employers believe young people leaving school, college or university are not “work ready”, according to a recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry.The wider rise in the number of people who have never worked means that a third of people who are currently out of work have never been employed, compared to a fifth in the late 1990s.At the same time, more people are working now this apparent paradox is explained by a reduction in the number of unemployed people who have previously worked and an increase in the number who have never worked.This latter trend is driven not by a group of people deciding to live on welfare benefits, the Resolution Foundation said, but by university and college students working less, a longer lag between leaving full-time education and getting paid work and the decline of the teenage Saturday job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4976b4501d8762f74088a03303f01eedad18a366/37_99_2632_1579/master/2632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=363d82ba0b2f3895425b3da5e05907c2","title":"saracens worcester premiership match report","story":"In his 20-plus years as Saracens chairman, Nigel Wray has presided over wins of more significance than this, but if the urgency of his charges’ performance is any gauge they were of a mind to pay him handsome tribute. The circumstances of his departure will continue to ide opinion. A 10-try demolition of Worcester, as eloquent as it was brutal, suggested his players feel strongly in favour of his legacy.The gap between Saracens and the rest of the Premiership remains at 18, but the odds are still in favour of them making it up, as the usual clutch of teams separated from each other by a handful of points squirm in discomfort above them. Worcester were squirming within a few minutes of kick-off.“We were comprehensively outplayed by a side who played magnificently,” said Alan Solomons. “They were absolutely outstanding.”More concerning still for Worcester was the neck injury suffered by Michael Fatialofa barely a minute after he had come on. After a lengthy break in play to tend to him, he was taken to St Mary’s hospital in Paddington, where he remained overnight.“It is a massive concern and I’m worried about it, but I haven’t had a report from the hospital. The medics have taken all precautions and have done everything possible. We’ve contacted his partner to let her know.”One need not have been particularly steeped in the rhythms of the Premiership to identify this as a likely candidate for messy mismatch – at least as messy as the Premiership gets. Wray’s retirement in midweek, Saracens’ defeat to Exeter last Sunday, Worcester’s pressure-relieving win – it all suggested a potential disparity in motivation levels.Then there is that yawning deficit Saracens must traverse just to survive in this league they have dominated for so long. Leicester’s full house against Bristol, registered just before kick-off, further heightened the sense of urgency. It should surprise no one that Saracens had their bonus point within half an hour. A half-time lead of 31-0 felt, if anything, on the lenient side for Worcester, as did the final tally. Saracens were held up over the line a further three times.Saracens’ first try was registered in the seventh minute, their second in the 11th. One of their latest problems is the form of those seemingly few among their number not in the England squad. Max Malins sat this one out with a knock to his foot, for which mercy Worcester might be only slightly grateful, but Ben Earl is another youngster likely to be on Eddie Jones’s radar. He was all over Worcester from the start, a barrelling menace with and without the ball.He barged over from close range for the first, after Elliot Daly, Alex Lozowski and the Vunipola brothers, in that order, announced themselves in fine form before England gather for the Six Nations at the end of the month. Rotimi Segun, whistled up on the day following Sean Maitland’s withdrawal, finished the second, put away by Daly after more ferocious approach work by, among others, Earl.Already, the prospects of a meaningful contest were bleak. Brad Barritt burrowed into an advancing maul for try No 3 before Mako Vunipola crashed over for the bonus point after a chip-and-gather cameo from Owen Farrell, whose tackle technique continues to flirt dangerously with the law. There was time for Segun to claim his second before half-time, following a yellow card for Anton Bresler.It is not uncommon for games to even up in such circumstances, even to favour the vanquished, the victors having sated themselves. But Saracens were not sated. No need to describe every try – they were scored in a variety of ways. Special mention for Duncan Taylor’s score on the hour, after a sharp chip and gather by Segun and for the game’s eighth, a few minutes earlier, because it was scored by the Warriors. Ollie Lawrence, comfortably Worcester’s best player once introduced at half-time, set Ed Fidow away for a chip-and-gather adventure of his own.It was a lone highlight for the visitors. With or without their chairman of yore, Saracens remain hungry and on the hunt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c231b6cba401a169ea4cd33d29db5b246cad442b/0_44_2731_1639/master/2731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aaec6fc1623a9ff0d01c363d91515f0","title":"tennessee titans new england patriots playoff score","story":"When the eerie Foxborough fog lifted, it became clear that New England’s reign atop the NFL was ending.Derrick Henry ensured that with the kind of dominating playoff performance usually reserved for Tom Brady and the Patriots.Henry rushed for 182 yards and a touchdown while Tennessee’s defense stymied Brady and perhaps ended his championship-filled New England career with a 20-13 wild-card victory Saturday night. Its a great win against a great team in a hostile environment,” Henry said on his 26th birthday. Credit to my team. Im just happy we were able to advance.We were just locked in. That was our mindset, just coming in here doing what we needed to do in all three phases, stay locked in no matter what happens in the game, and I feel like we did that.As that dense fog that shrouded Gillette Stadium for the first half dissipated, the Patriots, who made the last three Super Bowls and won two, stalled repeatedly with the ball. They no longer were the bullies on the block Henry was. Six-time champ Brady’s contract is up and the 42-year-old quarterback could well be headed elsewhere, including retirement.“I just came off the field,” Brady said when asked about his future, but added that it is pretty unlikely he will retire. “There is nobody who has had a better career than me,” he said. “I am very blessed.\u0027’As for this defeat, the Patriots’ fourth as a wild card, Brady noted: “They kind of stopped us in the first half and the second half and we couldn’t get the job done.”Meanwhile, the Titans (10-7) are headed next week to Baltimore, the league’s top team.There was no scoring in the second half when All-Pro Brett Kern’s 58-yard punt that took up 10 seconds rolled down at the New England one. Brady then was picked by former Patriot Logan Ryan for a nine-yard touchdown to finish off the Patriots (12-5), who at one point were 8-0.The game’s first three possessions wound up as three long scoring drives. A 29-yard screen pass to James White set up Nick Folk’s 36-yard field goal, but Tennessee answered with a 75-yard march built around Henry. He had no role on the touchdown, Tannehill’s pass to a Harvard man, tight end Anthony Firkser that made it 7-3.New England counterpunched with its own 75-yard drive, taking temporary control of the game by victimizing Tennessee’s defense on the outside. The Titans looked slow trying to protect the flanks as Sony Michel broke off a 25-yard run and White had a 14-yarder. Julian Edelman finished it with the first rushing touchdown of his 11 pro seasons, a 5-yard dash to the unprotected left side of the Tennessee D.New England appeared primed for another touchdown after Mohamed Sanu’s 14-yard punt return set up the Patriots at the Titans 47, and they steadily drove to first-and-goal at the one.All they got was Folk’s 21-yard field goal as three runs failed. It was the 13th time the Patriots had first-and-goal at the one in a playoff game in the Brady era and the first time they failed to get a TD on the drive.Tannehill led the NFL with a career-best 117.5 passer rating and by averaging 9.6 yards per pass attempt. But he didn’t do a whole lot Saturday night in his first postseason game: 8 of 15 for 72 yards. His awful decision to put the ball up for grabs on the first play of the fourth quarter resulted in Duron Harmon’s interception.But New England’s spotty attack flopped and never revived. That has not been unusual during the second half of the schedule.Tannehill’s passing yards were the fewest for a starter since the Ravens’ Joe Flacco had 34 in a wild-card win against the Patriots 10 years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68e06862eaabf67201518889c90944d01641f5dc/211_513_3079_1847/master/3079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4ca3ebe59820923f5c0dc852ac7b952","title":"david muir racehorse welfare","story":"The RSPCA consultant, honoured with an MBE for racehorse welfare, predicts an end to the use of the whipNew Year’s Eve brought the end of an era as David Muir, who has spent 21 years as racing consultant to the RSPCA, completed his final shift by overseeing the action at Haydock, his avuncular appearance as ever disguising the sharpness of his perception. The news had just broken that he was to be honoured by the Queen with a well-earned MBE for services to racehorse welfare.Muir has been a delicate task and he has handled it with such skill that attention has hardly ever been called to his presence, somewhere between the sport and the charity. For decades he has sustained dialogue between two groups inclined to be suspicious of each other, knowing there are iniduals on either side who would rather have nothing to do with those opposite.“By standing outside and shouting, you don’t have the same effect as being in there, dealing with the issues. That way, you can progress welfare, not by seeking enmity but seeking to be listened to.”“I never tell them what to do. I say: ‘Are you happy with that?’ And walk away. And they look at it and they usually find what you’re not happy about, without you claiming you’re better than them.“That’s one of the difficult things, if somebody thinks you’re trying to tell them their job. Sometimes we just go through life, becoming a little bit complacent until somebody brings our attention to something and we revisit it. That’s how I’ve tried to play it over the years.”Muir says he has had “an element of independence” from the RSPCA and his approach has not always found favour with its senior figures. Some have taken a belligerent line towards racing, as in 2012 when Gavin Grant, then the chief executive, demanded a list of changes to the Grand National, including the removal of Becher’s Brook.Muir’s pragmatic approach (discuss, advise, steer, cajole, urge) has always prevailed. This week, he drew glowing praise from his employers, the RSPCA’s current chief hailing him as an exceptional professional and from the British Horseracing Authority’s spokesman, who tweeted from his own account that Muir was a “top man”.He has been succeeded by Dr Mark Kennedy and it will be interesting to see whether Kennedy is as prepared to risk his standing at the RSPCA in order to keep the dialogue going in difficult times. Muir will stick around to advise him and will also be a consultant to the new Horse Welfare Board set up by the BHA.It would be tricky to unravel where the credit should lie for sundry improvements made in racing and Muir is not interested in claiming them. But he is gratified as he reflects on the changes to hurdle design and to tongue ties and the rule that ended mid-race remounting. His own revolutionary design for a new hurdle, distinctively coloured to make it more visible to horses, is perhaps two years from a racecourse trial. “They will go to trainers’ yards, where they will knock the living daylights out of them and come up with any issues.”One of his frustrations was that the traditional hurdle panels respond differently to being clouted by a horse, depending on the type of soil and prevailing weather. “This hurdle behaves exactly the same in whatever weather and whatever ground. You can school over it and then the horse knows exactly what it’s going to meet.”Though Muir’s role has changed, he is not walking away. He plans to continue doing his bit to further racehorse welfare for as long as he is able. “I enjoy horse racing. I like the physical aspect of horses being tested over fences. When a horse jumps a fence well, it looks great.“There’ll always be risk and everybody has to accept that. But that risk has to be minimised and it’ll only be done by people keeping on looking at things.” The next change he can foresee is a ban on jockeys using the whip to encourage a horse forwards. “The vast number of jockeys don’t misuse the whip but the ones that do bring the whole thing into the realm of contention. A limit of hitting it eight times is not good enough it’s how you hit it. If you hit it with force eight times, that is unacceptable. And to differentiate by stewards is difficult.“In the end it will come that they will be able to carry whips and be able to use them in circumstances where safety issues are involved and that’s all. Or they may go for keeping the whip in the rein hand and flicking it down. But I don’t see them being able to bring it down on the hind-quarters at 90 degrees. I think that’ll go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf144b254cb046d36e99d842739db2e3f6170b07/0_239_4176_2506/master/4176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a222ff6d4838ae8817a7f9799cebb61f","title":"cricket south africa england second test day three over by over live","story":"7th over: England 17-0 (Crawley 15, Sibley 2) With Crawley expecting more short stuff, Rabada tries to nail him with a sucker yorker. It turns into a low full toss, however, and Crawley flicks it fine for four. Crawley, like Sibley, seems to have an impressively equable temperament.“Morning Rob,” says David Horn. “The catch to Matt Emerson’s idea is that it’s straightforward, free to implement, and makes zero more dollars for The Man. It doesn’t stand a chance.” 6th over: England 12-0 (Crawley 10, Sibley 2) After a sluggish start, South Africa are starting to threaten. Sibley, offering no stroke, survives an LBW appeal from Philander. It was far too high. Maharaj then save four with a fine ing stop at mid-off.“I had a dream last night (and I just know you want to hear all about it) that I was playing football with Glenn McGrath and I told him to watch his step for balls,” says Niall Mullen. “If I didn’t know better I’d say my subconscious was trying to tell me I’ve been watching too much sport. But that can’t be right, can it?”The pedant in me, who is caged by frail and fragile bars, reckons you haven’t been watching enough: McGrath was playing touch-rugby, wasn’t he?5th over: England 12-0 (Crawley 10, Sibley 2) Crawley misses an attempted pull at Rabada, with ball deflecting off his arm and into the grille. There’s a break in play while the physio gives him the once-over, but he’s fine. Rabada is starting to work him over, however, and later in the over he thumps Crawley on the front arm with another short ball. Terrific bowling from Rabada, who walks down the track to offer a few observations on Crawley’s technique. “This could be a problem,” says KP of Crawley’s sudden vulnerability to the short ball, “and it’s not the problem you want in international cricket.”4th over: England 12-0 (Crawley 10, Sibley 2) Sibley is in the interrogation room, with Philander leading the AC-12 investigation into his off-side technique. He shovels Philander behind square for a couple to get off the mark. These two young England openers have started nicely.“Morning Rob, morning everyone,” says Matt Emerson. “An easier solution to no balls would be for the fourth umpire (who does very little during play) to monitor and then relay the number of no balls to the umpire at the end of each over. He then signals how many runs are to be added. No extra balls, which saves time, but it still penalises the bowler and changes their behaviour. Now let’s never talk of this again.”I quite like that idea. What’s the catch? There’s always a catch.3rd over: England 10-0 (Crawley 10, Sibley 0) “That’s beautiful, that’s really good,” says Kevin Pietersen on commentary as Zak Crawley defends assertively against Kagiso Rabada. “You can still intimidate a bowler and own that space by playing the most amazing defensive shot, where the ball goes straight off the middle of your bat to mid-off.”For all his foibles, KP is an extremely good analyst. You could never accuse him of just relying on his genius. As he showed in this brilliant book, he’s an unashamed batting geek.2nd over: England 8-0 (Crawley 8, Sibley 0) Here’s Vern, for the last time on his home ground. His first over is immaculate in its accuracy, but there’s no real movement and Sibley defends comfortably. A maiden. “A lead, a palpable lead!” weeps Brian Withington. “Giddy stuff from England - what can possibly go wrong from here? In other rhetorical questions, what are the chances of West Ham ignominiously folding at Gillingham this evening?”Sorry, Ashley Giles has banned all football chat on the OBO.1st over: England 8-0 (Crawley 8, Sibley 0) Kagiso Rabada takes the first over, presumably so that Vernon Philander can bowl from the favourable Wynberg End. Crawley gets his first boundary in Test cricket with a confident, wristy clip through midwicket, and his second with a lovely drive through mid-off. Two lovely strokes, those, but he gets carried away and tries to drive another off the last delivery. He dragged the ball onto the pad and just wide of the stumps.Stokes’s five-for equals the Test record for an outfielder. They were all difficult catches, too. He is, in the parlance of our time, gloriously backasswards.“Good morning,” says John Starbuck. “As has been hinted before, cricket should investigate the tennis Hawkeye system and consider installing a gizmo which records the front foot landing and beeps if it’s over the line. There are, admittedly, problems, in that (a) the field of play is so much larger that opportunities for accidents are increased (e.g. damage by the heavy roller) (b) the beep has to be very loud, especially if the crowd are in singing mood (c) it’s all managed remotely by the fifth umpire. Alternatively, we could ditch the present system and revert to a back-foot rule.”Oh lord, not a return to Rorke’s Drag. But I agree about technology. I’m sure they’ll find a way in the next few centur- sorry, years.England lead by 46 runs That was an exceptional bowling performance, led by the inevitable Jimmy Anderson: he ends with figures 19-6-40-5. That’s his 28th five-for in Test cricket. He turns 38 this year. Five wickets for Anderson - and five catches for Ben Stokes. Nortje, pushed back by a couple of bouncers, edged a big drive and was beautifully taken, goalkeeper-style, by Stokes at second slip.88th over: South Africa 222-9 (Philander 16, Nortje 4) A quiet over, one from it. Nortje looks very comfortable.87th over: South Africa 221-9 (Philander 15, Nortje 4) Pope at gully misses a run-out chance, with Nortje well short of his ground. Nortje survives the remainder of Anderson’s over without much difficulty, flicking a boundary over square leg to get off the mark. South Africa usually bat deep - Adelaide 1998 might be the strongest lower order in Test history - and Nortje is a terrific No11.86th over: South Africa 216-9 (Philander 14, Nortje 0) Philander decides it’s time to slog, which is slightly surprising given the excellence of Nortje’s batting in the first Test. He misses with swipes at Broad’s first two deliveries before taking a single off the fifth.“Mike Waters is close,” says Adam Hillmann, “but the real reason umpires have been instructed to ignore no-balls is that the ICC can’t think of any other way to increase the over rate.”Ha. It’s okay, they’ve cracked that problem – they’re going to increase it to 98.85th over: South Africa 215-9 (Philander 13, Nortje 0) Jimmy Anderson took an ODI hat-trick 17 years ago, but he hasn’t managed one in Tests. And he still hasn’t: Nortje leaves the hat-trick ball outside off stump. But he does have figures of 17-6-34-4. He probably wouldn’t have played had Jofra Archer been fit.Jimmy Anderson is on a two-day hat-trick! Kagiso Rabada goes first ball, thin-edging an immaculate delivery through to Buttler. No looseners here.Jimmy Anderson will open the bowling. He has two balls of his 17th over remaining, having taken the wicket of Keshav Maharaj last night.“Morning Rob,” says Mike Waters. “Could there be any credibility in the theory that the ICC have instructed their umpires to call as few no balls as possible as a way to deter the spot betting market, and by extension the illicit payments to players to bowl them on demand?”That’s a cracking conspiracy theory, but I suspect there’s approximately 0.00000000000001 per cent chance of it being true. “Four-day Tests? Look, I’m not a fan.”A bit of pre-play readingMorning. South Africa and England are perfect dance partners. In the last 28 years, since South Africa’s readmission to Test cricket, they have been as evenly matched as any teams in the world: 15 wins to England, 16 to South Africa and four series victories apiece. Usually, contrasting styles make for the best fights. With these two, it’s the similarities - quality seam bowling, lively pitches, an unusual mixture of toughness and insecurity - that have made the matches so compelling. One team rarely gets away from the other, particularly in the first innings, and that has led to many lowish-scoring minor classics: The Oval 1994, Headingley 1998, Lord’s 2012.And, perhaps, Cape Town 2020. South Africa will resume on 215 for eight, a deficit of 54, after a terrific bowling performance from England - and an even better catching display from Ben Stokes - on the second day. Not for the last time, the bowlers rescued the batsmen from the stocks.On a dry wicket, a first-innings lead would make England strongish favourites to level the series. But we should assume the square root of bugger all until those last two wickets are taken. The Ghost of Cape Town past, in this case an apparition of a frog in a blender, is a reminder that an exemplary bowling performance can quickly be undone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec1a64d97740fd9e3259dc6483575b7043faaebe/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97488c813ee39bdc2738914fd0152ee5","title":"where to go on holiday in 2020 alternative hotlist ethical destinations","story":"Our pick of 20 places to visit in 2020 celebrates inspiring conservation and community projects that are making a difference to people and the planetOpened last year, the 270km Juliana Trail, a hiking route through the Julian Alps, takes walkers away from some of the most visited parts of Triglav national park in a bid to combat overtourism.

It also has many events for cyclists and swimmers, including the world’s biggest annual swim-run event (1 August). Hire a bike to see the city and explore further afield. Put the bikes on the train for the 20-minute trip to the town of Kungsbacka, and cycle around Lygnern lake. Alternatively, stick to the southern coastal path from the centre to Särö island.There is no shortage of spots for wild swimming at lakes in and around Gothenburg. A short bus ride away is Gunnebo Slott manor house and gardens, with its organic restaurant – and lakes nearby. Typing badplats (bathing spot) into Google Maps will bring up a wealth of places with wooden quays and ladders into the water. There’s canoe hire on Surtesjön lake and nearby waters on the northern edge of the city, and sea-bathing to the south at Näset. On the island of Tjörn, further north, the Pilane outdoor sculpture park is breathtaking. For unwinding afterwards, there’s a free public sauna at Frihamnen, across the river from central Gothenburg.David CrouchItaly’s ‘greenest’ valleyThe rolling Vara valley in north-west Italy is not unusual in suffering a haemorrhage of young people from rural communities but it is unusual in its response: going greener. At the turn of the century, thanks to an enlightened mayor, farmers up and down the valley, which runs parallel to the coast between Genoa and La Spezia, started switching to organic production. The idea spread to hotels and restaurants, artisanal producers and tourist initiatives and led, in 2013, to the creation of the Val di Vara Biodistrict, to represent the businesses and run community events.The area’s Bio Festival, launched in 2018, is now an annual event, with streetfood, games, livestock shows and music. And last summer the Biodistrict started running full-day bus tours of the valley from Levanto on the coast (€47 adult, €25 child, family 2+2 €141, including lunch and tastings).In the past few years, young locals have opened five farms to the public and started 13 agriturismos, offering rustic rooms and farmhouse meals, plus jams, liqueurs, olive oil or meat to buy. Try Il Risveglio Naturale or Il Filo di Paglia. Local cycling enthusiast Marco runs five-hour e-bike tours of the valley – in Italian and English – from agriturismo L’Antico Cornio, with tastings of focaccia, cured meats, cheeses and wine (€60pp, book at foodyexperience).The capital of Val di Vara is Varese Ligure, a walled town dating from 1161, with a castle, medieval churches and a 16th-century stone bridge. On a small riverside square, Pietro Picetti, who is in his 70s, hand-carves wooden moulds for stamping corzetti (or croxetti), the local, disc-shaped pasta – once with prominent families’ coat of arms now often just with pleasing patterns, or your initials! Visitors can have an organic lunch of corzetti pasta with walnut sauce at Albergo Amici in Varese Ligure, before stocking up on foodie gifts from, say, honey and fruit farm Cascina le Bosche or herb and saffron producer Le Piccole Erbe. Dinner could be at the equally organic Antica Locanda Luigina in Mattarana. To work up an appetite for all this bounty, the Vara river and its tributaries offer kayaking, rafting and canyoning (valara.it) and the area is crisscrossed by footpaths including the Alta Via dei Monti Liguri – a 400km ridgetop cyclinghiking route. There’s more adrenaline action on the high ropes and zipwires of Parco Avventura Val Di Vara. Liz BoulterEco-snow sports, Swiss-styleThe Flims Laax Falera region in eastern Switzerland’s Graubünden canton is well-endowed with natural beauty but there’s a particularly primeval air to the landscape here. For starters there’s the Rhine Gorge, known in the local Romansh language as Ruinaulta and more commonly as the Swiss grand canyon. After a huge landslide thousands of years ago, the Rhine scoured a path through the debris, creating what is now a dramatic summer playground for hikers, rafters and bikers. Hikers can also explore the Unesco site of Sardona, where tectonic plates once crunched together, pushing the rock upwards and leaving a distinct limestone line across the mountains.Winter offers snowy walking trails, pro-standard snowparks and 224km of slopes in three linked ski areas. With the highest piste topping 3,000 metres, snow is reliable, yet as in many other Swiss resorts, Flims Laax Falera has recently seen its snowline creep upwards and its ski season shorten. Its plans to tackle the climate crisis are more ambitious than most.A vision of the urban futureRotterdam is a city that’s not afraid to experiment. From the architecture of Rem Koolhaas, one of its most famous sons, to the annual Rooftops Festival, which in 2019 saw 65 rooftops repurposed to host events, Europe’s largest port is a fascinating living laboratory for anyone interested in what urban living might look like in the coming years. There’s even a Sponge Garden for studying how best urban green spaces can be used to capture and hold rainwater and return it to the natural environment.Many of the city’s innovations are focused on a waste-free circular economy. It’s home to the world’s first floating farm, where 32 cows are fed on scraps from local hotels and restaurants, and produce milk for city residents and manure for Rotterdam’s flowerbeds. And at Blue City, a former indoor subtropical swimming complex has been repurposed to provide workspace for more than 30 startups working in the circular economy. “Waste” coffee granules from the Aloha Bar-Restaurant become soil for the mushrooms grown by a neighbouring startup another is fashioning fruit peelings into leather.From 1 May, visitors wanting to immerse themselves in the city’s vision can stay in one of Culture Campsite’s spaces in the riverside Delfshaven district, with choices of upcycled “sleeping objects” including a greenhouse, a silo and a cattle shelter.Although Rotterdam’s main attractions tend to look to the future, it has not forgotten where its citizens came from. With around 180 nationalities calling the city home, it has a claim to be one of the most multicultural in the world. A great place to understand this richness is the Story House Belvédère. This community-run enterprise in the Katendrecht district is part-cafe, part-gallery and part-events space. Headphones lining the walls play recordings gathered from around Rotterdam, sharing the voices of the many cultures that give the city its character, and there are exhibitions by its annual immigrant artist in residence.Jeremy SmithMarine protection and sustainability to savourMenorcans realised early that a sustainable approach to tourism was essential for avoiding the overdevelopment that has spoiled so much of the Mediterranean coast in Spain. A Unesco biosphere reserve since 1993, the island has crystal-clear waters, a thriving local culture and unique gastronomy.The best way to access the white sandy beaches of the south and rocky coves of the north is via the Camí de Cavalls, an ancient path for mounted soldiers connecting defensive lookouts that encircles the island. Thanks to pressure from a local NGO, it was reopened as a public right of way in 2010 and is now much-loved by Menorcans and visitors alike for walking, cycling or horse-riding.Since 2016, the Balearic Islands has collected a sustainable tourism tax and used it to fund local conservation initiatives such as the Underwater Atlas project, which maps the seagrass beds essential to the marine ecosystem so that they are not disturbed by boat anchors. Snorkelling around the coves to the east of Binimel-là beach you’ll find waters bursting with life – look out for octopus and even the odd Moray eel. Last year, some 20 sq km of coastal waters was added to the existing Unesco biosphere reserve, making it the largest protected marine environment in the Mediterranean.Stay at Ses Sucreres (doubles from €95 B\u0026ampB) in the pretty, whitewashed village of Ferreries in the centre of the island, and visit the homemade produce market in Plaça Eya, held on Saturday mornings, to sample the Mahón-Menorca cheese, with its distinctive sharp, salty flavour. Seafood also plays a huge role in local cuisine – Es Cranc restaurant in the tiny northern port of Fornells is known for its outstanding caldereta (lobster stew). Menorca is currently in the running for European Region of Gastronomy 2022.Annette PaceyCarbon-neutral capitalShopping, sightseeing and museums are the mainstays of most city breaks. Copenhagen has all these – but where else could you go skiing in the city centre, or float in the clear water of open-air harbour baths? CopenHill, a huge new urban ski slope, was built atop a renewable waste-to-energy power plant. As well as skiing and snowboarding, it has running and hiking trails, and the world’s highest outdoor climbing wall.For outdoor bathing, there are several options, such as the central Islands Brygge baths or the Nordhavn quarter, which has boardwalks, cafes and a beachy vibe. Real seaside isn’t far from the city: Amager Beach Park is an easy 5km bike ride away and has miles of white sand, islands and a lagoon. Other activities in town include sailing in solar-powered GoBoats and kayaking.Copenhagen has pledged to become the world’s first carbon-neutral capital by 2025. It is well on the way to reaching its goal, so is already a great place for a sustainable stay. It’s one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world, so explore it on two wheels – there are many hire points, 375km of cycle tracks and several pedestrianbike bridges over the harbour.Public transport is excellent, and expanding: the metro’s new City Circle line now links the centre with the neighbourhoods of Østerbro, Nørrebro, Frederiksberg and Vesterbro, and another new line opens this year, connecting the northern harbour.Noma put the Copenhagen food scene on the map with its use of ultra-local ingredients and innovative takes on traditional techniques but there are plenty of other restaurants with great food and low carbon footprints. Gro Spiseri is a rooftop farm-cum-restaurant where diners eat in the greenhouses, and Baest has its own microdairy producing cheese from biodynamic Danish milk.More than two-thirds of the city’s hotels hold an eco-certificate. One of the newest is the industrial-chic Hotel Ottilia (doubles from £120 B\u0026ampB), converted from two former brewery buildings in the emerging Carlsberg City district. It serves an organic breakfast, has a free “wine hour” from 5pm-6pm and the rooftop restaurant has views over the city.To get to Copenhagen from the UK without flying, take the Eurostar and onward trains to Brussels, Cologne or Hamburg, stay overnight, then continue to Copenhagen the next morning. (Stopping at one city on the way there and another on the way back adds to the fun.) Details at seat61Rachel DixonThe public rental bike system, Citybike Vienna, allows you to crisscross cobblestone streets to canalside avenues and sample the 300km of paths on the Wienerwald Cycle Route and the extensive Danube Cycle Path.The city has spent €8m on tree planting as part of initiatives to redesign parks and streets. Zieglergasse in the 7th district is Vienna’s first climate-adapted street, completed in December 2019. With drinking fountains, cooling arches, garden and shaded areas, alongside more space for bikes, it has been dubbed the “Cool Mile”. Nearby Neubaugasse, in the same district, will unveil a similar redesign in mid-January, for planned completion by autumn. Construction of a “Cooling Park” in the adjacent 6th district’s Esterházypark is due in spring 2020, and will include two “climate trees” made of three-metre-high mist showers within an expanded shaded, green space.Urban gardening is common, on organic city farms and private allotments, aided by some of the city’s 200 million bees in beehives atop the Vienna State Opera, the Burgtheater and the Old General Hospital. Some districts hold weekly local farmers’ markets, although the main central markets of Naschmarkt, Karmelitermarkt and Brunnenmarkt at Yppenplatz all feature local vendors selling organic produce. Access to fresh mountain water is the norm, with 1,000 free drinking fountains throughout the city.Vienna is proud of its affordable and accessible transport system: the annual inner-city transport card costs €1 a day. With a focus on lowering car usage, the Friday Nightskating event invites people to take to the streets on skates and bikes, as a way to encourage people to see the city without noise or pollution. A push to get more people to use the extensive rail network is backed by Austria’s train operator, OBB. The addition of services to Brussels and northern Romania, on top of routes to neighbouring countries, will establish Vienna as the best-connected city by rail in Europe in 2020.Becki EnrightBears, bison and bioersityYou don’t have to fly to southern Africa to go on safari – Romania is one of the best places in Europe to see large mammals in the wild. The country has seven million hectares of forests – a significant proportion is ancient virgin woodland – and is home to the continent’s largest populations of brown bears, as well as wolves and lynx. Among organisations working to protect the wilderness is Foundation Conservation Carpathia (FCC), which has ambitious plans to create the largest forested national park in Europe. Focusing on restoring degraded forests and the wider ecosystem, FCC recently launched an ecotourism programme, including bear tracking. It has built four wildlife hides and trains specialised guides for one- and multi-day trips. FCC is also rolling out a four-year bison reintroduction programme in the region’s Făgăraș mountains, in partnership with the ProPark Foundation for Protected Areas and Conservation Capital. The first animals will be released into the wild this spring.Besides benefiting local communities through wildlife tourism, the reintroduction of bison – which disappeared from Romania 200 years ago – will also increase bioersity. In a separate venture by Rewilding Europe and WWF Romania, the European commission-funded Life Bison project has already released 60 animals in Carpathia’s Tarcu and Poiana Ruscă mountains, with more to come this year. Bison-tracking holidays in the area are offered by the European Safari Company (part of Rewilding Europe). A two-night experience costs from €299, including guiding and meals. The Bison Hillock Association, also involved in the project, offers a choice of trips, too, with hiking, cycling and homestay options.While the country faces issues with extensive illegal logging (two rangers were killed last autumn trying to protect the forests, and protesters took to the streets in November demanding more government action), ecotourism is increasing steadily.“There are challenges but ecotourism is growing organically here and lots of small-scale ethical businesses are opening, using local guides and produce, with the money staying in the community,” said Andrei Blumer, president of the Association of Eco-Tourism in Romania.In the Danube Delta, new conservation projects include the reintroduction of water buffalo on Ermakov island. “We have amazing nature and wildlife and offer something unique in Europe,” said Blumer.Jane DunfordNative culture and natural beautyIt may not come as a surprise that a country led by a 34-year-old female prime minister and an all-female coalition is also a world leader in progressive environmental policies. Among the Finnish coalition’s key policies is a pledge to become a carbon-neutral country by 2035. Tourism is playing its part, with a rigorous sustainability policy that puts protection of the country’s natural environment first. But a commitment to protect nature – and people – runs the length and breadth of the country. In Utsjoki, the northernmost municipality, the 1,200-strong community is reinventing its tourism, after new regulations put an end to salmon fishing, once its largest source of income. Now Utsjoki is promoting its wilderness and Sami culture through mountain biking, kayaking, snow-shoeing and visiting the three villages to experience modern Sami culture, where reindeer husbandry is still a significant part of life.In the east, local company Äksyt Ämmät runs small-group tours of the forest, rivers and lakes of North Karelia. These are hosted by local guides and offer stays in small, family-run guesthouses: from a two-hour snow-shoeing tour through Koli national park (adults from €30 children €15) to a week on an island on Lake Saimaa (from €1,328pp) cross-country skiing and snow-shoeing and meeting villagers.In the autumn, Finland went a step further in its mission to create a tourism industry built on the long-term preservation of the environment, by introducing a tourism pledge, and encouraging visitors to not just enjoy nature but to “respect and treasure” it, too.Isabel ChoatMaking tourism a force for goodTourism has been a game-changer for Portugal, making Lisbon and, more recently, Porto into weekend hotspots with boutique hotels and hipster bars and restaurants. This has not been without a cost – one that’s been borne primarily by local residents and businesses, who find themselves forced out of neighbourhoods by rising rents. Acknowledging that this growth was too rapid, the government is determined that a planned increase in visitor numbers will be managed sustainably, spreading tourism across the country – and the seasons – and putting local people first.It is three years into a 10-year sustainability strategy under which millions of euros has been invested in a variety of programmes aimed at boosting tourism beyond the honeypot destinations. One such programme is Revive, designed to breathe new life into abandoned or run-down heritage sites. One of the first – of 33 – to open was Vila Galé, a former convent converted into a hotel in Elvas, a Unesco-listed but overlooked town near the Spanish border. A similar scheme, Revive Natura, will do the same for rural sites, such as former rangers’ cottages.In the southern Alentejo, the largest artificial lake in Europe, Alqueva, was once ignored even by locals but is now a destination with water sports, beach areas, boutique hotels and a dark sky reserve.Europe’s biggest gardening projectMore than 700 volunteer gardeners have been busy in Salford, removing invasive species from a 154-acre site and planting more welcome ones, including 40,000 crocus bulbs for a dazzling spring display. They are not toiling alone: a small herd of rare-breed pigs has been clearing brambles and digging over the soil. Oh, and there are quite a few professional gardeners on board, too.This is the new RHS Garden Bridgewater, the biggest gardening project in Europe. The £30m-plus site is due to open this summer on the site of Worsley New Hall, a 19th-century mansion on the edge of the city that was demolished in the 1940s. It is the RHS’s first new garden in 17 years and first urban garden, it has been designed by landscape architect Tom Stuart-Smith. A million annual visitors are expected to generate £13.8m a year for the local economy by 2029, with 140 jobs in the garden itself and 180 more in the surrounding area. Community is at the heart of this garden. Richard Green, the head of Bridgewater, says: “There is no other garden like this in the north-west of England, not on this scale. It is a mix of stunning horticulture and a place for people.”As well as the green-fingered volunteers, GPs are already referring patients to the garden through a “social prescribing” pilot scheme, whereby people struggling with isolation, mobility problems and other conditions are prescribed activities such as gardening. A dedicated therapeutic gardener, Ozichi Brewster, leads this programme, which has so far helped 40 people. Patients can plant hanging baskets, make bug hotels, go on woodland walks or join tai chi and yoga sessions in the wellbeing garden, a hub for community organisations such as dementia support groups and veterans.Young people have also been helping in the garden under the National Citizen Service. Soon there will be classrooms and a learning garden – about 7,000 local schoolchildren will be invited every year – and apprenticeship schemes. Adults can garden in community allotments in the walled garden four of the plots will be dedicated to growing produce for a local food bank. There are also demonstration areas to inspire visitors to transform their own gardens.Other prominent features include a kitchen garden, providing fruit and vegetables for the cafe a Chinese garden created with Greater Manchester’s Chinese community and a calming “paradise garden” with a huge pond. A wild woodland play area with hobbit holes, a bug garden and a low ropes course is designed to help children of all ages get outside, connect with nature and socialise away from screens.Those who can’t wait for the official opening in the summer can book a two-hour guided tour (£5, until April). Or why not join the green army? The garden is recruiting now for its next batch of volunteers.Ambitious habitat restoration projectIt’s easy to presume that the Cairngorms national park, with its ancient woodlands, peat bogs, untamed rivers and forbidding mountains, is faring well when it comes to conservation. But in fact, much of its native flora and fauna has been damaged by hundreds of years of poor management and a burgeoning deer population. One organisation is now helping turn the tide by putting together the most ambitious vision for habitat restoration Britain has ever seen.Committing to an ecological timeframe of 200 years (there’s no room for a short-term mentality here), neighbouring land managers — including Wildland, RSPB Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry and Land Scotland — will work together to restore native woodlands, peatlands, wetlands and rivers.In 2020, visitors will get a better sense of the project thanks to a newly refurbished visitor centre, interpretive walks and volunteering opportunities. Since 1959, when it was just a caravan parked on borrowed land, the Loch Garten Osprey Centre in Abernethy has grown into the RSPB’s second-largest and most erse reserve, home to more than 5,000 species. Thanks to funding from European Structural Funds, the centre will in 2020 be renamed and refurbished with improved access, and open for eight months of the year: the Loch Garten Nature Centre will help explain Cairngorms Connect as part of a wider conservation story.Beyond the centre, interpretive walks will be added to the Big Pines and Two Lochs trails to enhance understanding of the UK’s largest single remnant of ancient Caledonian pinewood.While Cairngorms Connect’s focus for 2020 is getting local communities involved, visitors will get a look-in, too. Volunteers can join one-day projects from seed collecting to planting (once live, opportunities will be advertised on the Cairngorms Connect website).Rewilding tour operator Scotland: The Big Picture has launched a four-day Wilderness Weekend: Cairngorms Connect (15-18 May, from £765pp), which takes visitors on a conservation-oriented journey through the erse landscapes.Also opening in the region next year, as part of the Cairngorms national park’s net zero by 2045 vision, is a Speyside Way extension and a Strathspey electric bike project.Holly TuppenStargazing in the Sperrin mountains, County TyroneThe Sperrin mountains, which straddle the counties of Derry and Tyrone, are often overlooked by visitors heading for the Giant’s Causeway on the Antrim coast, or various Game of Thrones locations. But the Sperrins are “Ulster’s wildest land”, according to Irish poet Mary Montague. “The thickest sheets of the last ice age scoured these mountains into smooth undulations that banner the skyline. But don’t be fooled by gentle curves – the Sperrins’ heart is vastly bleak,” she says.The Sperrins area of outstanding natural beauty is a wild, untouched landscape of moorland and forest, punctuated with tarns and bogs. It also offers rare unspoiled views of the night sky. A scatter of neolithic monuments, such as the Beaghmore stone circle, bear testament to the fact that the constellations have long held sway over these parts.In April, Northern Ireland’s first dark sky observatory will open in Davagh Forest, giving visitors the opportunity to experience the night sky away from light pollution.This dense woodland, with miles of moss-covered conifers, has a fairytale quality, with sika deer roaming free and the odd sighting of rare pine martens. It sits in a small valley formed by the Davagh Water, one of the headstreams of the Owenreagh River, and is popular with hikers and mountain bikers. But the £1.2m Dark Sky Park will focus attention upwards, with a telescope trained on the solar system through a retractable roof.A series of audio-visual shows with maps of the solar system will be specially created for night-time events and screened on to the buildings: visitors can watch from a viewing platform, and explore the universe via holographic installations and virtual reality headsets. There will also be exhibitions linking the landscape with the archaeological and astronomical heritage of the Sperrins, as well as a play planetarium for children.And for those who want to extend their stay and sleep under the stars, like the ancients, five glamping pods are being built alongside the centre (from £100 a night for four people, sperrinviewglamping).Andy PietrasikA biosphere reserve is not merely a landscape that’s been put aside for nature, but a place where communities have learned to live alongside natural habitats. The Isle of Wight has been awarded the accolade thanks to its rare wildlife — red squirrels in the woodlands, Glanville fritillaries on chalky cliffs, and the Ventnor wall lizard on sunny, beachfront walls — and sustainable economic development. Collaboration between environmental organisations, charities, councils and local volunteers is improving the island for locals, visitors and nature alike. The Common Space, a non-profit, is working with local volunteers to revitalise the Bay area in the east of the island a 2020 calendar of events includes British Science Week (6-15 March), when pop-up laboratories will showcase natural wonders from pond life to fossils.In Sandown on the south coast, Browns Golf Course is getting a wildlife makeover thanks to a new footpath linking a previously overgrown woodland walk and reedbed wetland. Via the Lost Duver Project, the council and community are also restoring former dune stacks in Sandown by replanting native coastal flora such as ragged-robin and thrift.From a commitment to green building (Tom’s Eco Lodge is powered by a solar field and biomass boiler) to supporting rewilding initiatives (Tiny Homes’ wildflower meadows), tourism is very much part of the island’s biosphere fame.Also launched in 2019, Visit Isle of Wight’s Slow Travel Guide encourages visitors to leave cars at home, with eight car-free touring routes via bus, rail, bike or footpath. The island’s sustainable travel scheme also allows accommodation owners with the highest green ratings, including Nettlecombe Farm (from £370 for four people per week) and Seaview Hotel (from £95), to offer guests free bus travel.Holly TuppenThe Recovery Olympics in JapanThe Tokyo Olympic Games of 1964 became a symbol of Japan’s economic rebirth after the second world war, when visitors were dazzled by the country’s ambition. This time around, the organisers of Tokyo 2020 are hoping the games will signal the regeneration of the Tohoku region, which was devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and open up a lesser-known part of the country to visitors.The games are billed as the Recovery Olympics, and the Olympic torch - made of aluminium recycled from the temporary shelters used to house 500,000 displaced people – will begin its relay at the J-Village football stadium, just outside the 30km exclusion zone of the crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, before moving through the neighbouring prefectures of Miyagi and Iwate, also affected in 2011. The J-Village and Azuma baseball stadium in Fukushima City will host baseball, softball and football matches in the summer.Almost a decade after the disaster this is not an exercise in dark tourism – though one operator has started running Chernobyl-style tours of the Fukushima exclusion zone. Rather, it is an opportunity to discover a more authentic side of Japan – away from the tourist-thronged shrines and temples of Kyoto.The bullet train delivers passengers from Tokyo at warp speed – actually 90 minutes, though it feels like travelling back in time from the frenzy of the 21st-century capital – to what Richard Lloyd Parry describes in his book Ghosts of the Tsunami as a “slower, gentler” arcadia of mountains, lakes, rivers and “fields rich in grain and fruit”. (Tohoku is famous for its high-quality rice, peaches, grapes, Kitakata ramen and sake – though producers have struggled to overcome fears about contaminated food, despite it being exported once more.)Aizu, in the west of Fukushima, is steeped in the history of the samurai, the hard men of the north, but it is also famous for its delicately detailed lacquerware dating back to the 16th century and flourishing in the Edo era (17th-19th centuries). Onsen villages, such as Tsuchiyu, have sprouted around hot springs in the mountains, and to the north, often wreathed in wisps of low-lying cloud like a Hokusai print, lies magnificent Mount Bandai.This conical volcano in the Bandai-Asahi national park is surrounded by lakes, including the vividly cobalt pools of Goshiki-numa. When Olympian Tom Daley visited the region last summer, he stayed at the charming Bandai Lake Guesthouse and performed frontflips and backflips on the jetty by Lake Sohara. The ultimate irony is that this Lake District of Japan was formed by another natural disaster – when Mount Bandai blew its top in 1888.Andy PietrasikCreating a vast nature reserve Tens of millions of bison once thrived on the great plains of north America but by the late 1800s they had almost disappeared. Now the near-threatened species is grazing once again. Some 20,000 now live in America, mostly in small, often fenced-in, herds. But on the high plains of north-east Montana more than 800 beasts roam free. The conservation of this herd (or obstinacy) is just one of many wildlife projects run by American Prairie Reserve (APR), a non-profit that aims to preserve vast tracts of wilderness.Using a similar model to the Tompkins Foundation in Chilean Patagonia, the APR makes strategic purchases of private land that it uses to stitch together tracts of existing public land. Since it started in 2004, APR has bought over 100,000 acres, which has been joined with public land to form 419,000 acres of rolling hills and grassy plateaux drained by the Missouri River. The goal is to form a prairie area of roughly 3.2 million acres, complete with migration corridors – the largest nature reserve in the continental US.The APR’s activities have upset local ranchers and farmers. But founder Sean Gerrity, who made his fortune in Silicon Valley, is determined to create a vast ecosystem where wildlife large and small can roam free.As well as bison, it runs projects to protect habitats and increase populations of at-risk animals, including prairie dogs, cougars, pronghorns (endemic deer) and grassland birds. With no fences, the freedom-to-roam philosophy applies to visitors, too. It’s possible to walk, cycle or canoe for miles and see nothing manmade, except the odd signpost. Small-scale accommodation options include two campsites (from $15) with RV hookups a safari-style lodge and two pairs of large yurts – Founders Hut and John and Margaret Craighead Hut – each connected by a hallway and accommodating nine people in four bunk rooms. A third “hut” is due to open this year.Under big Montana skies, visitors can wake up to scenery that has barely changed in centuries, and that will be protected for generations to come. Isabel ChoatBirthplace of Greenpeace grows greenerVancouver calls itself a 20-minute city: it takes 20 minutes to get to the beach, the mountains and the airport. But green space is not in short supply either. Downtown Stanley Park is bigger than Central Park in New York, and is surrounded by water on three sides. Visitors can cycle around it along part of the Seawall, a 28km path around the city’s waterfront. Nearby Vanier Park is a summer hotspot, with its Bard on the Beach Shakespeare festival and big attractions such as the Museum of Vancouver. A little further out, the Pacific Spirit regional park has a network of hiking routes in 1,850 acres of forest, while North Shore is the place to head for legendary mountain biking trails.Now, Vancouver’s Greenest City Action Plan aims to drastically reduce carbon emissions, with 122,000 new trees planted since 2010. It is a fitting initiative for the birthplace of Greenpeace (the environmental group was founded here in 1971) and Vancouver continues to raise the bar: last month, the world’s first fully electric commercial aircraft took off from here, raising hopes of a new, guilt-free “electric aviation age”.The 100-mile diet – eating only food grown within 100 miles of your home –originated in Vancouver in 2005. Restaurants that have embraced this include Forage, whose executive chef hunts, fishes and keeps bees Chambar, which has been carbon-neutral since 2011 the Acorn, an award-winning “vegetable-forward” restaurant and Edible Canada, which promotes sustainable, seasonal food and stocks an enormous range of Canadian produce for diners to take home.The central Listel hotel (doubles from £90), has a five-Green Key eco-rating and is full of original work by Canadian artists.Rachel DixonSustainable recovery after terror attackIn the past 10 years, Sri Lanka has flourished as a tourist destination. Opening up to visitors since the end of the civil war has meant a growth in accommodation, from tea plantation bungalows and surfer hostels to mountain-view hotels and treehouses among the lush lowland rainforests. The number of tour companies has also increased, with more of them travelling to remote, lesser-visited regions such as the national parks of Gal Oya and Wilpattu, and the coastal areas of Kalpitiya and Kalkudah, benefiting smaller businesses including tuk-tuk drivers, souvenir sellers and family-run restaurants.As the country looks ahead, there are projects to be celebrated. The Sri Lanka Ecotourism Foundation, running since 1998, supports social and economic development of rural communities. Its work ranges from renewable energy projects, such as small-scale wind-solar farm training programmes, to empowering women through ecotourism roles, including a new lagoon-side campsite and activity centre, the Hikkaduwa Women-Centric Ecotourism Project. It also launched a new national sustainable tourism certification for hotels in April 2019.Beyond this, there are compelling sustainability and community-based tourism projects all over the country. Mangrove replanting has been taking place since the 2004 tsunami – including at Kitesurfing Lanka in Kalpitiya. Mangroves are not only an effective defence against the sea, but also help boost wildlife and act as long-term carbon sinks.Waste Less Arugam Bay is a partnership aiming to educate tourists and local communities about plastic – through, for example, reliable waste collection, creating souvenirs from recycled plastic, and providing water bottle refills. Fairtrade homeware and clothing brand Selyn uses a female-led workforce, traditional techniques and maintains a cottage industry via regional producers, which welcome visitors.Joining local families in the lesser-travelled inland part of Tangalle in the south, Experience Travel runs tours to support rural crafts and practices, such as producers of handcrafted buffalo curd, served as a delicious sweet dessert in clay pots called mee-kiri, topped with sticky kithul palm syrup.Antonia WilsonCommunity tourism begins on new Route of ParksFew countries on Earth have allocated more land for environmental protection in recent years than Chile, which in 2018 set aside 10 million acres of Patagonia to be preserved in five national parks. This was due in no small part to the conservation work of American philanthropist Kristine McDivitt Tompkins (ex-CEO of outdoors company Patagonia) and her late husband Doug (co-founder of North Face), who donated a large chunk of the land. In 2020, it will be easier than ever to visit these remote reserves, thanks to the new Route of Parks. Launched last year, the route consolidates a haphazard tourist circuit ning 1,700 miles (and 17 national parks), from the volcano-dotted forests of Chile’s Lake District to the fjords at the southern tip of the continent.Locals in the 60 communities along the route have responded to the Tompkins’ vision by taking ownership of the wilderness and starting tourism projects that will help protect the parks in the long term (as well as create sustainable incomes). Chaitén-based Ruta Patagonia 7 runs tours along the famed Carretera Austral (Southern Highway) to the newly designated Pumalín national park, a rainforest reserve in remote northern Patagonia. Further south, Patagonian Fjords has opened up the previously inaccessible – and newly created – Kawésqar national park to tourism for the first time, with trips through its fog-draped fjords departing from the resort town of Puerto Natales.New hotels have also popped up along the route, including Estancia Caleta Josefina (rooms from £135), on a sheep farm in Tierra del Fuego. And in 2018 Patagonia national park (home to one of the most ambitious rewilding efforts in the Americas) opened a new museum, Patagonia Park Museum, which explores local history and the current extinction crisis. Another museum dedicated to the Anglo-Argentine pioneer Lucas Bridges (author of Uttermost Part of the Earth, the 1947 landmark book on Tierra del Fuego) will open here in 2020.Connectivity, long a barrier to regional development, has improved alongside the new route. There is no land connection between the northern and southern sections of Chilean Patagonia, but a ferry service now links the end of the Carretera Austral with Puerto Natales, making it easier for tourists to travel along a unified path without detouring into Argentina. A road under construction in a remote stretch of Tierra del Fuego will finally open up little-visited Yendegaia national park, which protects the ice fields of the Cordillera Darwin mountain range.Mark Johanson This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Not one but two superb new three-part adaptations back to back in successive weeks, pretty much giving the lie to the line that the BBC, especially BBC One, can’t do anything over the festives but lazy schmaltz and the execrable Mrs Brown’s Boys. It did them too, of course, the world must keep turning (dammit), but…Although to call them adaptations is perhaps stretching it. After a genuinely fine Christmas Carol 10 days ago, last week we had an even better Dracula: first a genuinely complex Scrooge, and now a captivating vampire tale ripe and reeking with unsettled souls the pair could have proudly held their heads up as standalone drama series at any time of any year. The imprimaturs of Dickens and Stoker were almost incidental.The tone was set within the opening minutes of Dracula. A fly landed on the open eyeball of poor destroyed Jonathan Harker, telling his ghastly tale to nuns in, he thought, a safe asylum. There would be many, many more flies, but this first was crucial. “Is it gone now?” he murmured offhandedly, after blinking. It was indeed. Into his eye. We saw it crawling behind the white filmy cornea and over his pupil.There were nods to the original narrative, but this was a more grown-up and clever beast altogether, with true high questions about good and evil, betrayals and loving sacrifice, as befitted a labour of love from Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat. Nods, too, particularly by Claes Bang as the count, to a certain era of campness in the decades of films – “So I’m a monster. You’re a lawyer. Nobody’s perfect” – but this was in general about as far from Hammer House of Horror as Lawrence of Arabia is from Carry On Up the Khyber.We even got a bit of Sherlock, in the voyage of the Demeter, several nods to Inside No 9 and, yes, time travel, yet some will have recorded all to watch later and I’d feel truly angry to be offered spoilers. Yet expect Dolly Wells, searing as sister Agatha Van Helsing, to be offered much work this coming year. A word of warning – do not watch pretty much any of this if you have one fly, even one last lost lazy fly going for the glaze on the tinfoiled gammon, in the room. It will land on your eyelid, and you will shriek.And – what’s this, Doctor Who bang back to form? Someone has been drip-feeding showrunner Chris Chibnall testosterone, not to any ridiculous extent of machismo, but just enough for him to remember that alien monsters have to be scary, not misunderstood candidates for soft courses of bloody “mindfulness” or any such tommyrot. It was from the off just big blithering fun, as were the best of the Bond movies on which this two-parter is based: exotic locations, half-decent gags (the satnav’s “in 20 seconds, turn right. In five seconds, die”: that’s one I want), actual thrills and spills and a certain logic to the puzzle-solving, rather than last series’ cloying warm mimsy.And the return of the Master. I am told by Whovian “experts”, whom you tend to meet at parties at this time of year, effusively outside their comfort zones and proffering, drunkenly, mistletoe, that this is a Very Big Thing. Whatever. A few things to note (apart from “whatever” being well and truly over, this being a clean new decade): the actors work increasingly well together, newly well, and Chibnall has a newly confident hand on the helm: those rocks, as in Dracula’s Whitby, were getting perilous close.Talking of mistletoe: can it be true, as I was recently told, that it’s known by young folk who spend more time glued to their phones rather than living real life (limping angrily through cold rain) as the “perverts’ garnish”? Surely not… yet I was foully reminded of the capacity of some men to absolutely bloody queer it for the rest of us by the heftily strong, if arguably needlessly redramatised, The Trial of Christine Keeler.Christine’s imagined voiceover at the start of the second bite of this six-parter – “We both gave in to the most natural human instinct of all… the love of a powerful middle-aged man for a penniless teenage girl” – was about all the knowing archness we got from Miss Keeler. Not Ms. Miss. Those were those days. In truth, Christine, powerfully channelled by Sophie Cookson, came across as confused, utterly non-arch, both unworldly and scornfully knowing, rather daffy, rather dim, mercurial, dully beautiful. Exploitable. And 19. 19. At which age many people are all those things.I might have had more doubts about the production had it not been weighty on garlanded female credentials – adapted by Amanda Coe, directed by Andrea Harkin – which suggested it might dare to give the female lives their complex due. And so it befell: Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies have been given their young lives back, rather than existing as adjuncts only to historical geopolitics, and wisecracking nudge-nudgery, and as such this has been a marvellous endeavour, finely produced and shot. If only I could shed the prickled suspicion that the BBC had such a success this time last year with A Very British Scandal that bean-counters wanted, with drear automaton minds, a repeat. Next Christmas: David Mellor?Wisting (BBC Four) is the best Nord-noir ever. Since the last one. What did Scandinavian film-makers think they were ever doing, 80 years of existential angst and Death playing nihilist chess, before remembering: we have crime. Coal. Snow. Blood. Fire. Cheekbones. Let’s do that.Frankie Boyle’s New World Order delivered, as always, with an end-of-year roundup featuring a full four fantastic guests and an audience (they’d presumably known he wasn’t Michael McIntyre) that at one stage was left jaws agape at a joke’s wizard tastelessness. Don’t do that: the flies will get in.Yet the BBC just had to crack out one last turkey in the shape of Miranda: My Such Fun Celebration. This faux-nodded to Ms Hart’s rise to splendid deserved glory, the subtlety and the lovely co-stars and the winning plea for not everyone to be a 5ft 10in beauty, without actually ever getting it. In front of the London Palladium, poor pratfalls and squawking and “galloping” and catchphrases and jokes about weight and class abounded, and it was sub-awful, and Miranda must be retching.Never mind.

A hundred years later, opposition to conscription fuelled protests against the Vietnam war. There has been no draft since 1973.Experts including Mittelstadt, however, have said reinstating the draft might in fact help build a more inclusive society.Should the US and Iran go to war, America’s fighting will be done by its volunteer military, about 1.3 million strong and dominated in the enlisted ranks by recruits from working-class and minority groups.Writing for the  in 2014, the long-serving New York Democratic congressman Charles Rangel said: “The same familiar faces have served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. A more inclusive military draft … would compel everyone in the nation to stop and rethink about who we send to wars, how we fight – and why we fight them at all.”All American men aged 18 to 25 are required by law to register with the SSS. Many do so when applying for a driver’s license or applying for student loans. Those who do not register cannot receive federal financial aid or work for the federal government.A return to the draft may remain unlikely, but the SSS says it is prepared to “rapidly provide personnel in a fair and equitable manner while managing an alternative service program for conscientious objectors”.According to the agency’s website: “Current plans are frequently tested, evaluated, and revised as necessary.“If implemented, they will guide the Selective Service System in making a smooth transition from current reduced readiness levels to full conscription within six months.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2be75dcdd7a1d5f554cd53da6f6fc7f540b27e77/0_220_5226_3134/master/5226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb88282c186b2ee23b58362bc0b6d5e","title":"us citizens in iraq tell us about your situation","story":"We’d like to hear from US citizens in Iraq about their situation following embassy advice to leave the country.

He noted that months of negotiations with the People’s party had already produced a plan for a 2021 tax reform that emphasises environmental protection.“Big, fat, stinking diesel SUVs are going to get more expensive,” Kogler told the party meeting in Salzburg, citing the current wildfires in Australia as an example of natural disasters fuelled by climate change.The Greens want Austria to become carbon-neutral in 2040, a decade earlier than the EU’s target.The election became necessary after the collapse of Kurz’s previous coalition government with the Freedom party following the release of a video showing its then-leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, offering favours to a purported Russian investor.The Austrian coalition is being closely watched as a possible template for a future government in neighbouring Germany, where the Green party has also been riding high in recent polls.

Few did. His father, Chiune Sugihara, was a trader who lived in a small coastal town about 34 miles south of Tokyo. When not on business trips to Moscow, he coached his young son in mathematics and English. He made breakfast, spreading butter on the toast so thinly “nobody could compete”.His son had no idea his father saved 6,000 Jews during the second world war. Over six weeks in the summer of 1940, while serving as a diplomat in Lithuania, Chiune Sugihara defied orders from his bosses in Tokyo, and issued several thousand visas for Jewish refugees to travel to Japan.Now the life and legacy of his father will be celebrated in Lithuania, 80 years after he issued “visas for life” to refugees who sought his help. Lithuania’s government has declared 2020 “the year of Chiune Sugihara”: an official programme promises an exhibition of photographs in Lithuania’s parliament, as well as concerts, conferences, films, postage stamps and a monument erected in Kaunas, Lithuania’s former capital, where Sugihara was posted in 1939. It is all part of the burgeoning memorialisation of Sugihara, who in 1984, two years before he died, was declared “righteous among the nations” by Yad Vashem, the Israeli state organisation that commemorates the Holocaust.Chiune Sugihara was sent to Kaunas in the autumn of 1939 to open a consulate, soon after Nazi tanks had rolled into neighbouring Poland. At first glance, it was a curious posting for the up and coming diplomat who, by leaving blank an entrance exam paper for medical school, had defied his father’s wish for him to become a doctor. There were no Japanese people registered as living in the country, thousands of miles from the Pacific. But Kaunas was an ideal place for Japan to check up on its ally, Nazi Germany, whom it suspected of making a secret pact with Joseph Stalin, as well as plotting an invasion of the Soviet Union. Both suspicions were confirmed by Sugihara’s contacts with Polish spies, and reconnaissance of Nazi troop movements, sometimes done under the guise of a picnic.Lithuania would suffer a double occupation by Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. But for nearly 10 months at the start of the second world war, Kaunas was the free capital of independent Lithuania, “a Casablanca of the north”, a hotbed of spies, as well as a short-lived haven for refugees fleeing Soviet and Nazi occupiers.Sent to Lithuania to gather intelligence, Sugihara had probably not bargained for the scores of refugees who arrived at his gates in 1940. After the Soviet Union invaded Lithuania on 15 June, refugees flocked to the modest two-storey Japanese consulate that was also home to Sugihara, his wife Yukiko, their two toddlers and a newborn. Many were Polish Jews, who had arrived only months earlier after the Soviet invasion of Poland. Now they were looking for a second escape.Sugihara sought instructions from his foreign ministry in Tokyo. He was told not to issue visas to anyone without proper papers, ruling out almost everyone in the queue. Making another request to Tokyo, he was told not to ask again. He decided to issue visas anyway. Over six weeks in July and August, he worked 18-hour days, eventually writing out by hand 2,139 transit visas – a record only discovered years later in the archives of Japan’s foreign ministry.Sugihara’s story is “a kind of bright light” for Lithuania, says Simonas Strelcovas, a historian who has written a book about the Japanese diplomat and the refugees who fled to Lithuania. He found the overlooked fact that many of the Polish Jews were fleeing Soviet repression rather than the Holocaust, which had not yet begun.He highlights that these refugees survived because of Sugihara’s actions, combined with the Lithuanian government’s openness to refugees until the Soviet invasion in June 1940. It is a record that contrasts with the later participation of some Lithuanians in the murder of Jews, documented by the Yale historian, Timothy Snyder. “Those refugees lived without any problem from autumn 1939 to the summer of 1940 because of the Lithuanian state,” Strelcovas said. “We need as much Sugihara’s story as Japan needs Sugihara today.”Sugihara’s lifesaving visas were just one part of the paper trail. A Dutch businessman-turned-diplomat, Jan Zwartendijk, issued many Polish refugees with final destination visas to the Dutch colony of Curaçao in the Caribbean. Another forgotten player was Stalin.Sugihara, who spoke fluent Russian, had to bargain with Moscow to ensure the Jewish refugees had safe passage through the Soviet Union, as well as the right to leave Vlaostok for Japan. The promise of hard currency earned from the sale of refugees’ travel documents helped the Politburo reach its decision in July 1940. Stalin signed the order approving transit for refugees, which the Soviet document said included Jewish religious (yeshiva) teachers and students, salesmen, lawyers and other liberal professions.While these players are often left out of the Sugihara story, other Hollywood-style embellishments have been woven in. Often repeated is the claim that Sugihara’s wife, Yukiko, massaged daily her husband’s hands, worn out after writing hundreds of visas. Their youngest son casts doubt on this romantic detail, pointing out his mother and older brothers were already living at a nearby hotel for their safety. Another tale has Sugihara flinging blank visa papers out of the train window as he left Kaunas for the last time, a detail his son said was “not true at all”, pointing out the station would have been full of Soviet soldiers. Sugihara may have surreptitiously written out a final few visas to people on the platform. “There was no chance that he would throw something off the train,” said his son, who also rejects reports that Sugihara gave away an official government stamp to the Polish underground.Beyond the record of 2,139 names Sugihara filed belatedly to Tokyo months after issuing visas, there is no certainty over how many lives were saved. The estimate of 6,000 comes from assuming each holder of a transit visa travelled with two other people, a wife and child. Other researchers have suggested that 10,000 people were saved.In an undated letter to a Polish scholar written after the war, Sugihara said 3,500 people might have benefited from his visas. “The actual numbers nobody knows,” said his son."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/501e307c9bc1f5466d4bd7348f9486078fc1ea76/2532_203_2373_1423/master/2373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b84d85d25bff0d27cdea77d90aa37049","title":"yoweri museveni begins six day trek through uganda jungle","story":"President’s critics decry plan to retrace steps of his guerrilla forces that seized power in 1986The Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, began a six-day march through the jungle on Saturday to retrace the steps of his guerrilla forces when they seized power three decades agoMuseveni is one of Africa’s longest-ruling leaders. He seized power in 1986 after taking part in rebellions to end the rule of Idi Amin and Milton Obote, and is expected to seek a sixth term in office in elections due in 2021. Critics dismissed the march as an attempt to rally support ahead of the poll.Museveni began what will be a 120-mile (195-kilometre) walk from Galamba, north of Kampala, to Birembo, south of the capital where his rebel army faced one of its toughest battles in the fight to overthrow Obote.“The great trek started today and will last six days. This is a journey that the president is leading, a journey through the past to appreciate the present,” Museveni’s senior press secretary, Don Wanyama, said.“The journey will take a week through the jungle, a route the liberators led by Museveni took to liberate the country.”The walk comes a month after the president led an anti-corruption walk through the capital in a move derided by critics who said the corruption took place under his government.Museveni is facing an election challenge from Bobi Wine, a pop star turned leading opposition politician who appeals to a youthful population that has only ever known one president.The trek “is part of the wasteful ventures government is taking aimed at boosting his dwindling support among Ugandans”, Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, said.“My advice is rather than spending taxpayers’ money on such trips, Museveni should know time is up for him to leave power. Time for hoodwinking peasants has passed him. The peasants and everyone in Uganda are demanding change and no less,” he said.Asuman Basalirwa, an MP from the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, criticised the trek as a campaigning tool. “Ugandans deserve better than a president walking through a jungle. Time spent should be used for other important issues affecting the country, especially how he plans to hand over power,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcbfc27d09ca4c54672865079376ac9d155fc5d2/0_182_4271_2562/master/4271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30564b0303a9b25bf865babd6beb4a79","title":"china buying influence czech republic loan company","story":"Prague security services say the regime poses major threat as loan firm launches propaganda campaign to burnish Beijing’s imageThe Czech Republic’s richest man is at the centre of a suspected foreign influence campaign by the Chinese government after one of his businesses financed an attempt to boost China’s image in the central European country.In a development that has taken even seasoned sinologists aback, Home Credit – a domestic loans company owned by Petr Kellner that has lent an estimated £10bn to Chinese consumers – paid a PR firm to place articles in the local media giving a more positive picture of a country widely associated with political repression and human rights abuses.Home Credit also funded a newly formed thinktank – headed by a translator for the Czech Republic’s pro-Chinese president, Miloš Zeman – to counteract the more sceptical line taken by a longer-established China-watching body, Sinopsis, linked with Prague’s Charles University, one of Europe’s oldest seats of learning.Experts say the moves have the hallmarks of a foreign influence campaign by China that highlights its aggressive attempts to gain access to former communist central and eastern European countries through its ambitious “belt and road” initiative, under which it offers to fund infrastructure projects in those states.According to analysts, the Czech Republic has been more open to Chinese influence than most other European countries, a situation that has coincided with the burgeoning commercial relationship between China and Kellner’s sprawling PPF group, which boasts an estimated £40bn in assets, including Home Credit. PPF began accumulating its vast wealth in the mass privatisation of state assets that followed the fall of communism in the former Czechoslovakia in 1989.Critics accuse Home Credit of currying favour with the Chinese regime in an effort to protect its interests after a series of political disputes between China and the Czechs that cooled previously warm bilateral relations.Home Credit has acknowledged paying the PR firm, C\u0026ampB Reputation Management, and backing Sinoskop, the thinktank, to try to bring “greater balance” to debate about China.“Discussion of China in the Czech Republic had become one-sided, relentlessly negative and poorly informed,” Home Credit’s spokesman, Milan Tomanek, told the Observer. “Home Credit simply sought to add greater balance to the discussion by enabling different viewpoints to be heard … We want open, informed conversations on every country, including China, particularly where distorted conversations are hurting our image and reputation.”Martin Hala, a lecturer at Charles University’s Sinology department and director of Sinopsis, said: “The bottom line is that Home Credit hired this company not to defend their own corporate interests per se, but rather to promote the narrative coming from the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese communist party.“The first goal is to normalise China, presenting it not as a dictatorship but as a country, like any other, that is opening up to reforms. I don’t think that’s an accurate picture.”The revelations coincide with a recent warning by the Czech intelligence service, BIS, that Chinese influence campaigns pose a greater threat to national security than alleged meddling by the Russian government of Vladimir Putin.“The BIS considers primarily the increase in the activities of Chinese intelligence officers as the fundamental security problem,” the report says. “These activities can be clearly assessed as searching for and contacting potential cooperators and agents among Czech citizens.”Czech ties with Beijing grew closer after 2014 when the regime granted Home Credit a nationwide licence to offer domestic loans, the first foreign company to be given the right.Experts say this would only have happened on the understanding that Home Credit would work to ensure favourable coverage of China in the Czech media and political discourse. It heralded several trips to China by Zeman, who is close to Kellner, and culminated in a state visit in 2016 by the Chinese leader Xi Jinping to Prague.The rapprochement – which also saw the purchase of a Czech brewery, television station and Slavia Prague football club by a Chinese energy company, CEFC – reversed the policy adopted by the late Václav Havel, the Czech Republic’s first post-communist president who had championed human rights, and the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet.But relations began to sour last year when the Czech government of prime minister Andrej Babiš, acting on advice from the country’s cybersecurity agency, banned Huawei phones from ministerial buildings, prompting Chinese protests and a rebuke from Zeman, who accused the security services of “dirty tricks”.They took a further turn for the worse when Prague’s liberal mayor, Zdeněk Hřib, refused to abide by the One China policy – recognising China’s territorial claim to Taiwan – accepted by his predecessor as part of a twinning arrangement between the Czech capital and Beijing. In retaliation, China scrapped the agreement and cancelled a planned tour of the country by the Prague Philharmonia.Amid the rows, criticism began to appear in Chinese state media of Home Credit’s lending practices, accompanied by several failures in court to fully recover unpaid debts. That has fuelled speculation that the company began to fear for the future of its interests in China.When Sinopsis reported the Chinese media criticism on its website, it received a “cease and desist” legal warning from Home Credit which threatened to sue unless in the absence of an apology. The company accuses Sinopsis of failing to correct “misleading or incorrect statements”.Home Credit had earlier abandoned a £50,000 sponsorship deal with Charles University – which foreswore each institution from damaging the other’s good name – after a backlash from academics, who feared it would muzzle any criticism of China.Now critics see a new threat, from PPF’s recent £1.62bn purchase from AT\u0026ampT of Central European Media Enterprises (CME), a company which includes the Czech Republic’s most-watched commercial TV station, Nova, as well as channels in neighbouring countries. PPF has dismissed warnings about potential political interference in the station’s output but some are sceptical.“PPF negotiated this deal saying that they would never meddle in politics,” said Petr Kutilek, a Czech political analyst and human rights activist. “But from the Home Credit affair, you actually see them meddling in politics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b076045b277e0b88bf7cd180b96b32c45e3fdc8/0_116_4669_2802/master/4669.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=069a46003a454d4aeeba916e82656b8a","title":"making of a martyr how qassem suleimani was hunted down","story":"For Qassem Suleimani, the 62-year-old head of Iran’s Quds Force, and one of the most powerful men in the Middle East, the short flight from Damascus to Baghdad late on Thursday was routine. Travelling by private charter, the architect of Tehran’s strategic efforts from Lebanon through Syria and Iraq to Yemen would have avoided all formalities at one of the world’s most securely guarded airports.As his plane touched down just after midnight on Friday morning after reportedly disappearing from commercial flight trackers shortly before landing, two cars were waiting to greet the burly general at the aircraft steps.On the tarmac was a familiar face, Suleimani’s long-time associate Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the Iraqi leader of the Iranian-backed Shia militia Kata’ib Hezbollah, whose supporters had laid siege to the US embassy in Baghdad for two days last week in retaliation for US airstrikes that killed 25 militia fighters on 29 December.Muhandis and Suleimani had urgent matters to discuss – not least their joint desire to pile pressure on the US. Despite Muhandis ordering his militia away from the American embassy in Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone, they had been targeted by the Americans in response to a series of attacks on bases where US troops were present.Suleimani also had pressing issues on his mind. According to US officials, he had flown to Baghdad concerned about escalating anti-government protests in Iraq, some of them fuelled by anti-Iranian sentiment, and anxious to canvass further assistance from Muhandis in countering them. Growing numbers of Iraqis have become disillusioned by a failing economy and ballooning unemployment, and angered by the power wielded in their country by Tehran.Climbing into the first car with Muhandis, with their guards following in the second, Suleimani and his small convoy sped towards an access road by the far end of the runway.What the cars’ occupants did not know was that details of Suleimani’s visit had been leaked days before. They were being observed by an American MQ-9 Reaper drone transmitting their movements to the Pentagon and CIA.As the SUVs turned to skirt the airport’s low perimeter wall topped with barbed wire, at a safe distance from other travellers and Iraqi officials, the drone fired two missiles, slamming into the first car carrying Suleimani and Muhandis, buckling the metal and setting it on fire.A third missile followed quickly, striking the second car carrying the bodyguards. The impacts were as devastating as they were lethal. While Muhandis appears to have been vaporised on contact, Suleimani’s hand, covered in grey ash, was pictured dangling through a window, identifiable by the ruby ring he always wore.The assassination of Suleimani, ordered by President Donald Trump from his Florida golf resort, took only an instant, but it is a moment that now threatens radically to transform the volatile politics of the Middle East and challenge the basis of America’s own engagement there.And as so often with Trump, it was an act that was deeply contradictory, flying in the face of everything the president had said before, not least his repeatedly expressed desire to exit what he has called “the stupid endless Mideast wars”. Far from promising a quick way out of the “stupid wars”, many experts agree, Trump’s decision to kill Suleimani seems to presage only a deeper and more violent entanglement.Confronted with the questions “why?” and “why now?”, many observers have struggled to move beyond both the enormity of the event and fear of what many believe will be an inevitable blowback.“It is hard to overstate the significance,” remarked David Petraeus, former head of the CIA and a former commander in Iraq, adding grimly: “There will be responses in Iraq and likely Syria and the region.”A second former acting head of the CIA from the Obama era, Michael Morell, was more brutally forthright. “There will be dead Americans, dead civilian Americans, as a result of this,” he said, adding for good measure: “I think we’ve now ended any hope of keeping Iraq out of Iran’s arms.”What few have any doubt about, however, is that Suleimani’s assassination, an act that the George W Bush and Obama administrations both eschewed, has escalated the conflict between Tehran and Washington that has intensified since Trump withdrew from the Obama-era deal to curb Tehran’s alleged nuclear weapons programme, and instead ratcheted up sanctions in the policy known as “maximum pressure.”By one reading, the US drone strike was the culmination of a deadly cycle of events that began, largely unnoticed at first, on 27 December more than 250km north of Baghdad on the sprawling K1 air base outside the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, a centre for the fight against the remnants of Isis still operating in the western desert.At 7.30 in the evening, a barrage of 31 107mm Katyusha rockets, fired from a lorry, slammed into a building housing Iraqi federal police and the counterterrorism service. The Iraqis, however, were not the target. Instead, the missiles were aimed at an area housing around 100 US and other foreign trainers, killing one American civilian interpreter and injuring several more.In the immediate aftermath it was at first suspected that remnants of Isis had launched the attack. But within hours US officials, including Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, were pointing to another suspect – the Kata’ib Hezbollah militia, set up by Muhandis.The officials pointed to a recent pattern of rocket attacks they attributed to Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. Pompeo warned that any further attacks “will be answered with a decisive US response”.But a response to the K1 attack, as it would turn out, was already well in train. The Pentagon authorised airstrikes on several Kata’ib Hezbollah bases identified as housing the perpetrators of the attack, killing 25 and wounding dozens more. Suddenly, a conflict which had been simmering largely under the radar was thrust into view.On New Year’s Eve it was the turn of the militia to respond. Summoning supporters to the vast US embassy in Baghdad, they stormed the compound’s reception, sacking it and setting it on fire.Three days later Suleimani flew into Baghdad, and to his death, with the US alleging he had travelled there to orchestrate new attacks on its forces with his right-hand man in Iraq, Muhandis.The manner of Suleimani’s death at the hands of a US foe he had for so long opposed, often violently, has added a new layer of complexity to the legacy of a figure whose life story was full of bloody contradictions.A key figure in the grotesque slaughter of the Syrian war, where he helped prop up the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad, Suleimani was also instrumental in the fight against Isis in Iraq, earning him the admiration of many Shia there. And while some saw him as the Middle East’s malign puppet-master, he saw himself as a loyal servant of Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Either way, he had become an almost mythical figure in the region, a far cry from his humble roots.Born in impoverished circumstances, and with little forma education, his school was the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps where he became commander of the Quds Force in 1998, tasked with expanding Iran’s influence through covert operations and through ties with the network of proxies he developed from Lebanon to Yemen.His skills as a tactician earned him a grudging respect even in senior US military circles.One telling assessment was supplied last year by the American general who once contemplated killing him, Stanley McChrystal, writing in Foreign Policy. In almost admiring terms, the former commander in Iraq painted Suleimani as a “confident, proven leader”, “a calculating and practical strategist” and a “shrewd pragmatist”.For Vali Nasr, however, the Iranian-American academic and author who served as dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, Suleimani’s reputation was as much a creation of Washington as it was of Iran.“The US built him since 2008 so he was the only military commander who was known in US foreign policy circles,” he told the Observer, adding that there were other figures active in prosecuting Iran’s strategy while Suleimani occupied a role similar to the role of US Central Command.“Although he was very capable in many ways, he was seen as this one-man army responsible for everything happening in Iraq and Syria, which wasn’t accurate. Now he’s dead, the assumptions of the Trump administration appear completely naive in terms of what to expect, not least the comments in Pompeo’s talking points saying that Iraqis are happy that they’ve been liberated from him.“People are more complicated than that. Iraqis can be simultaneously unhappy over Iran’s meddling but still have a warm view of Qassem Suleimani who they credit with defending the south against Isis and who was the one who showed up in Erbil with enormous amounts of weaponry to provide defence for the Kurds.” And far from strengthening US influence in Iraq, argues Nasr, the assassination may have “pulverised” US relations with Iraq’s government. “The momentum is now with the hardliners to push the US out.”Ali Vaez, an Iran expert with Crisis Group, is also sceptical of the assumptions in the Trump administration over the hoped-for outcomes from Suleimani’s killing.“It doesn’t mean if you decapitate it, it will be paralysed. It’s a state institution of the armed forces of Iran. I think he will be difficult to replace but not impossible. The Quds Force has lots of people with similar profiles with a similar degree of experience and expertise who would be able to push forward Iran’s regional policy.Vaez cautions too: “It’s often the case that the man standing behind steps in, even if he lacks the vision and tactical skills, and risks being more of a hardliner, which will only exacerbate the stresses.”If the events of the last week appear at first surprising, all they have really done is highlight a competition for influence in Iraq that has festered since the moment US-led forces deposed Saddam in 2003, a conflict in which Suleimani has long been a key player.While the Bush administration had glibly assumed the victors’ spoils would fall to the US in what it saw hubristically as an opportunity to reshape the Middle East, Tehran also saw an opportunity to influence its old neighbour and foe with the replacement of the Sunni-dominated Baath party by its Shia co-religionists.Among exiles returning after the war were those who had sought refuge in Iran in the Saddam era, including veterans of the Badr Corps – Iraqis who had sided with Iran in the conflict’s brutal trench warfare that, with its use of poison gas and massed attacks, seemed like a rerun of the battles on the Western Front.One of those key figures was Muhandis, born in Basra to an Iraqi father and Iranian mother, who had fled Iraq in the Saddam era and had risen through the ranks in Iran to become a senior commander.Even as the US forces were battling an insurgency by Sunnis drawn from the old Baath party ranks and a new iteration of al-Qaida, Shia militias, many taking guidance from Iran and Suleimani, were pursuing their own agenda to undermine the US-led vision for Iraq, a policy that would see the lives of some 700 US servicemen laid at Suleimani’s door.If that tension was put on the back burner during the devastating rise of Isis in Iraq, when Suleimani and the US would be fighting a common enemy, all that changed with the election of Trump and his abrupt withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. As Trump formed an alliance with Saudi Arabia against Tehran, the scene was set for the escalation of a series of proxy wars across the region, one that in recent months has seen the Kata’ib Hezbollah militia targeting US interests in Iraq.According to a Reuters report on Saturday, that involved a meeting in October in a Baghdad villa where Suleimani told militia commanders under the direction of Muhandis to form a new group of low-profile paramilitaries – unknown to the United States – who could carry out rocket attacks on Americans housed at Iraqi military bases.And despite the celebration of Trump and his allies, for some experts the killing of Suleimani smacked not of strength, but of weakness.“President Trump’s decision to escalate hostilities by killing Qassem Suleimani epitomises the failure of his strategy for dealing with Iran,” said David Schanzer, an expert on terrorism at Duke University.“Trump abandoned diplomacy as a means to constrain Iran by backing out of the nuclear accord in 2018, opting instead to use punitive economic sanctions to pressure Iran to end its aggressive behaviour. The result? Iran is now advancing its nuclear programme, acting with greater aggression in the region, and fomenting greater violence inside neighbouring Iraq.”All of which raises the question of why Trump took what may be the biggest gamble of his presidency?At Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s pink-walled Florida resort where the president had retreated from Washington to celebrate the holidays, there was no hint early last week of what was being contemplated.Reporting in the US media suggests, however, that behind the scenes Trump and his advisers were already heavily engaged in drawing up a response to the K1 attack, including the retaliatory airstrikes, when the president was alerted that US intelligence agencies had learned that Suleimani was flying to Baghdad from Damascus.And on the agenda since at least last Sunday, even before the violent demonstrations at the US embassy, was the proposed assassination of Suleimani, a notion, some suggest, that may have first been mooted as long ago as early summer.According to the Washington Post, Trump was prodded by officials who reminded him that he had failed to respond to previous attacks blamed on Iran, including the mining of oil tankers in the Gulf, the shooting down of a US surveillance drone and the rocket attack on a Saudi oil facility.“The argument is, if you don’t ever respond to them, they think they can get by with anything,” one White House official told the paper.When it came to the crunch, the moment of decision was oddly banal. On Thursday, just hours before the assassination, Trump played a round of golf, then later huddled with his campaign team to review plans for this year’s election, leaving the meeting for a few minutes at around 5pm, the moment, some believe, when he delivered the “kill order”.And after the fact there has been a slew of new rationalisations.In a conference call with US media on Friday, the national security adviser, Robert C O’Brien, described the strike as “aimed at disrupting ongoing attacks that were being planned by Suleimani and deterring future Iranian attacks through their proxies or through the … Quds Force directly against Americans,” while Trump himself suggested the killing was intended to prevent a war, not provoke one.That may be a moot point.By Saturday, as thousands of mourners for Suleimani marched through Baghdad chanting anti-American slogans, what was certain, even as Washington deployed 3,000 fresh troops to the Middle East, is that the next move will be decided in Tehran.Every major newspaper and state-controlled TV broadcast has focused on Suleimani’s death, with even reformist newspapers such as Aftab-e Yazd warning of revenge, and new billboards carrying the same message.“His work and path will not cease, and severe revenge awaits those criminals who have tainted their filthy hands with his blood and the blood of the other martyrs,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said, while the defence minister, Amir Hatami, promised a “crushing” response.The only question is the timing, with many anticipating that there will be careful deliberations among Iran’s leaders before any response.“Look, this is a pragmatic regime not a suicidal one,” said Vaez, “and the pragmatism emanates from the very top. That pragmatism is not going to change but Iran will have to respond to this otherwise it will be seen as weakness inviting more US aggression. But retaliation is inevitable even if the risk of a miscalculation is very high.”The key calculation in Tehran, argued Vaez, is predicting Washington’s response and whether a “massive retaliation” might force a withdrawal similar to the one after the 1983 bombing of a US marines barracks in Beirut that claimed 241 lives, or whether a more proportionate response – perhaps targeting a senior US official for assassination – is a safer course.“But the question is what was different last night? The onus is on Trump to prove something was different, or this is no different than another weapons of mass destruction play.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Searches taking place for second man on board boatRoad closed in both directions after four-vehicle collision at DrombaneSecretaries from across country protest over \u0026lsquotwo-tier\u0026rsquo system of pay and conditionsMinister for Justice had expressed concern at footage taken inside former Portarlington hotelRT\u0026Eacute broadcaster died suddenly on Thursday at her Kildare homeAccused (63) has been charged with 26 offencesDepartment will contest Data Protection Commissioner\u0026rsquos decision in courtOwen Keegan says land not appropriate for housing, wants funds for culture, sportDublin City Council granted permission for seven-storey scheme with 132 bedspacesExecutives asked to give up office space in new \u0026euro140m headquarters over desk-sharingMothers more likely to be victims, in family court cases including violence and threatsFormer president says pontiff has managed to stir debate within Catholic ChurchMar arrested after Eoin Hamill suffers fatal injuries in crash on Springfield RoadIrregularly shaped cigarette packs will also be prohibited under new restrictionsUp to 20 youths involved in fight in north Dublin suburb, leaving male (18) with severe injuries to handLucky winner fails to step forward, but Millionaire Raffle ticket \u0026lsquomay have been a gift\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4130835.1578162269!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"n%C3%B3ra quoirin s parents file civil claim against malaysian resort","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Nóra Quoirin (15)  who went  missing from a Malaysian rainforest resort last August. Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesLawyers in Malaysia representing the parents of Franco-Irish teenager Nóra Quoirin have filed a civil suit against the operator of the Dusun holiday resort where Nóra was staying when she disappeared last August.The Quoirins are claiming at least €40,000 in damages and claim the resort failed to keep the premises in which they were staying safe and secure.The defendant in the suit is Helen Marion Todd, who operates the resort.The statement of claim was filed on December 24th in the Seremban Sessions Court, Negeri Sembilan, by Sankara N Nair and partners on behalf of Nóra’s mother and father, Meabh Josephine Quoirin and Sebastien Marie Philippe Quoirin. The date for the first case management hearing has been set for January 21st at Seremban Sessions Court.The statement of claim states that Nóra Quoirin went through pain and suffering from August 4th until August 13th, 2019. The 15-year-old’s body was found in the jungle about two kilometres from the Dusun resort by a group of hikers who had volunteered their help in the massive 10-day search. The Quoirins plead that their daughter’s disappearance and death “were caused directly by the defendant’s negligence andor recklessness, both by way of act or conduct and omission”.A spokeswoman for the Dusun resort said that a statement would not at the moment be issued in response to the allegations. Nóra’s parents are making a claim against Ms Todd for special damages in the sum of 152,707.90 ringgit (about €33,372), general damages as assessed by the sessions court, damages for bereavement of 30,000 ringgit (about €6,555), and “damages for pain and sufferings”.On October 8th last year, through their lawyers in Malaysia, the Quorins demanded that the defendant pay them damages, but, the statement of claim alleges Ms Todd had so far “failed, neglected andor refused to pay any damages”. Window latch brokenThe statement of claim states that, on or about March 18th, 2019, the plaintiffs booked and paid for a three-night stay at the Dusun resort from August 3rd until August 6th, 2019.The family had intended to spend three days at the resort before travelling around Malaysia.After travelling from overseas, Meabh and Sebastien Quoirin checked into the resort with Nóra and their two other younger children on August 3rd. After the journey “they were exhausted and went to bed”, their claim states.The next morning, at or about 8 am, Nóra’s parents discovered she was missing and noticed that the window in the living area of the bungalow in which they were staying was ajar.Their statement of claim alleges that the latch on the window was broken and the window could easily be opened by anyone from outside.It is also alleged that the perimeter fencing was not secured and the entrance gate of the Dusun was kept open at all times and no security personnel were in place to guard the property.Furthermore, it alleges that there was no closed-circuit television and no other safety facilities were installed at the resort.It notes that Nóra was born with a medical condition known as holoprosencephaly which left her with balancing and coordination difficulties. “In addition her motor skills and core strength were very poor, and the deceased was unable to walk without the help of an adult. The mental age of the deceased at the time of death was about five or six years old only.”PostmortemsAfter the postmortem on Nóra’s body, Malaysian police said on August 15th that there was no evidence of foul play. The police said the cause of death was upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to a duodenal ulcer complicated with perforation. The bleeding in Nóra’s intestine was most likely caused by prolonged hunger and stress, Negeri Sembilan police chief Mohamad Mat Yusof said. The final results of the postmortem carried out in Malaysia, including the toxicology reports, have not yet been released.The Quoirins are also still awaiting the results of a second postmortem, carried out in London.Nóra’s parents have said they believe there was a criminal element in the disappearance and death of their daughter and have called on the Malaysian authorities to open an inquest.Mr Nair says he suspects that Nóra was abducted."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Car ploughs into six German tourists killing six and injuring 11 in northern Italy Carlos Ghosn: Escape to Lebanon was \u0026#39unjustifiable\u0026#39 and \u0026#39illegal\u0026#39 says JapanLibya violence: 28 people killed in attack on military school in TripoliUS military base in Kenya attacked by Islamist group al ShabaabNHS chief has warned that \u0026#34perverse\u0026#34 planning rules restricting gyms from opening are undermining efforts to solve the obesity epidemicMedics celebrate success \u0026#39beyond our wildest dreams\u0026#39 on haemophilia Comment: Why does Labour have such a problem with patriotism?Sir Keir Starmer launches Labour leadership bid and says he will not retreat from \u0026#39radicalism\u0026#39 of Jeremy Corbyn eraGolden Globes 2020: Ricky Gervais regrets Tim Allen joke and won\u0026#39t \u0026#39go after\u0026#39 the stars this yearEleanor Tomlinson as Steve McQueen: stars pose for paintings in their dream rolesComment: Leavers and Remainers need to learn the lesson of the Scouts and put isions of Brexit behind themHow Parliament was \u0026#39misled\u0026#39 into backing project that won\u0026#39t reach North for 20 yearsBoris Johnson to keep civil service chief in Britain to take charge of reformsJeremy Paxman dumps flytipping blame at door of ministersComment: There has never been a better time to shake up the rail industry and deliver resultsComment: HS2 review was unduly influenced and lacked independence Taxpayers will suffer £40billion loss if HS2 goes ahead, official reviewer warnsComment: The UK\u0026#39s brightest and best can give us fresh optimism in EU negotiationsMaimed policeman seeks rougher ride for dangerous driversMinisters set to lose their farm subsidies when they vote for Brexit this weekWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/04/TELEMMGLPICT000220295003_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqH6AXo6C6fdOCFilDkyXAxAXQvMBVjz7Jw3ZXH8sQqLg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"golden globes 2020 ricky gervais regrets tim allen joke wont","story":"Ricky Gervais outside the Beverly Hilton, venue for the 77th annual Golden Globe AwardsOn the four occasions he previously hosted the Golden Globes, Ricky Gervais managed to insult some of the most famous names in Hollywood.But for his fifth outing on Sunday, the British comedian said he has decided to pull his punches when it comes to taking potshots at inidual stars.Instead, Gervais said, he will make more general jokes about the acting industry. He admitted that he regrets one joke in particular, aimed at the actor Tim Allen, after realising how much he had hurt Allen’s feelings.Allen, the veteran actor and voice of Buzz Lightyear in the Toy Story trilogy, was jointly presenting an award with Tom Hanks at the 2011 Globes ceremony.“What can I say about our next two presenters? The first is an actor, producer, writer and director whose movies have grossed over $3bn at the box office. He has won two Academy Awards and three Golden Globes… the other is Tim Allen.”When the two actors walked on to the stage, Hanks said in an unscripted remark to the audience: “Like many of you, we recall when Ricky Gervais was a slightly chubby but kind comedian.”Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter ahead of Sunday night\u0027s ceremony, Gervais insisted that his routine would be near-the-knuckle.But when asked who would be his firing line, the comic said: “Well, I don’t think this time iniduals are. I think I’ll go after the general community.“I’d go after cinema and I’d go after television and I’d go after actors and I’ll go after pretension and hypocrisy. I’d go after those big, nebulous things where they can all feel I’m not picking on any one person. I’m never going to point to someone and say, ‘You had a bad year, mate.’”He added: “I might do the odd one, but… only if it’s bad behaviour. But I’m for forgiveness as well. I have to go after people bigger than them even, I have to go after studios, I’ve got to go for the top.”Ricky Gervais said he regretted making a joke that poked fun at Tim Allen“And I have nothing against Tim Allen. He’s a good actor. He’s probably a nice bloke. So even though there’s no malice and I can justify it comedically and everyone laughed, I didn’t want Tim Allen to think, ‘Oh, that was written for me. Why me?’”That same year, Gervais joked that the “airbrushed” poster for Sex and the City 2 should win the award for special effects, adding that the cast were so old he had seen one of them “in an episode of Bonanza”.Afterwards, one of the film’s stars, Kim Cattrall, called it “a cheap joke” and accused Gervais of ageism.This year’s ceremony will be an environmentally-friendly, meat-free affair after the organisers decided to make it Hollywood’s first “sustainable” awards ceremony. Guests will eat a vegan menu of chilled beet soup and mushroom risotto.Netflix dominate this year’s nominations, which  film and television. Three of the five best picture nominees in the drama category are from the streaming service: The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes.But the favourites to win the acting awards are Renee Zellweger for Judy, in which she plays Judy Garland in the final year of her life, and Joaquin Phoenix for his role in The Joker.Buckle up, Hollywood hypocrites: the glorious history of Ricky Gervais\u0027s Golden Globes insults Car ploughs into six German tourists killing six and injuring 11 in northern Italy Carlos Ghosn: Escape to Lebanon was \u0026#39unjustifiable\u0026#39 and \u0026#39illegal\u0026#39 says JapanLibya violence: 28 people killed in attack on military school in TripoliUS military base in Kenya attacked by Islamist group al ShabaabNHS chief has warned that \u0026#34perverse\u0026#34 planning rules restricting gyms from opening are undermining efforts to solve the obesity epidemicMedics celebrate success \u0026#39beyond our wildest dreams\u0026#39 on haemophilia Comment: Why does Labour have such a problem with patriotism?Sir Keir Starmer launches Labour leadership bid and says he will not retreat from \u0026#39radicalism\u0026#39 of Jeremy Corbyn eraEleanor Tomlinson as Steve McQueen: stars pose for paintings in their dream rolesComment: Leavers and Remainers need to learn the lesson of the Scouts and put isions of Brexit behind themHow Parliament was \u0026#39misled\u0026#39 into backing project that won\u0026#39t reach North for 20 yearsBoris Johnson to keep civil service chief in Britain to take charge of reformsJeremy Paxman dumps flytipping blame at door of ministersComment: There has never been a better time to shake up the rail industry and deliver resultsComment: HS2 review was unduly influenced and lacked independence Taxpayers will suffer £40billion loss if HS2 goes ahead, official reviewer warnsComment: The UK\u0026#39s brightest and best can give us fresh optimism in EU negotiationsMaimed policeman seeks rougher ride for dangerous driversMinisters set to lose their farm subsidies when they vote for Brexit this weekComment: Don\u0026#39t trash your civil service Mr Johnson - it is, in fact, a world beaterWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/12/18/12/ecohouse.jpg","title":"20 pledges eco friendly sustainable home living","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Our house will never be environmentally or architecturally perfect – but hopefully we can just make it a little better for the planetPicture an eco-friendly, sustainable house.

I\u0027m hopeful too that we can do that without taking ourselves off the grid or avoiding the 21st century, not least because my job as technology editor means using the latest kit.Hopefully, what we will learn will not only help educate us and you the reader about how we can all make improvements, but also help show companies how they can better enable their customers to do so.There are plenty of people, like me, living in old and often rented accommodation where they have limited scope to make improvements. Those people are of course concerned about living without damaging the Earth, too, and so I hope to find ways we can all make our homes a little more sustainable together.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s time to start asking what the sporting world can do to prevent global warmingIn 2020 The Independent will be doing more than ever before to try and make the world a better place. When it comes to sport, that’s easier said than done.Sport is our escape, a way to block out the realities of everyday life for 90 minutes, or a few hours, maybe even an entire day. It is supposed to be enjoyed even in defeat, and yet not even sport is exempt from the greatest threat to humankind today: global warming and the negative impact of climate change.But not even sport can continue to ignore the perils that will come to threaten its very existence unless something is done to change the path it is on. After all, how will our children and grandchildren play football, rugby or cricket if there are no parks left, or will the next Lewis Hamilton be uncovered if we can’t find a sustainable way to maintain motorsport without the use of oil, petrol and even electricity?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis year we will be delving into how sport affects the surrounding environment, exposing the shocking truths of how it is damaging the world as we know it and highlighting the ways people are trying to bring change for the better.Why will we be doing this? Whether your outlook on global warming is akin to Greta Thunberg or Donald Trump, the truth is that sport has one of the biggest impacts on climate change. Whether it’s the Arsenal squad using a private jet to fly to Norwich, or single-use plastic being used at just about every stadium across the globe, there are endless examples of ignorance when it comes to helping the environment.There will be positives, too. What is Formula E doing to inspire change not just in motorsport but in our everyday commute? What inspired Forest Green Rovers to become the world’s first 100 per cent vegan football club? And are extreme adrenaline sports the answer – they tend to go hand in hand with being at one with the world around us in an effort not to damage it.And if we are to cover all areas of this subject, we will have to take a close look at ourselves too: the media. Is it right that journalists travel all year round aboard the most environmentally damaging transport available in automotive vehicles and aeroplanes, throwing away countless notebooks instead of recycling? If we are to ask the difficult questions, we have to be prepared to answer them too.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The demographic\u0026nbsptimebomb is well known — even if no one has adequately dealt with it — and the vast global debt burden of $188 trillion (£143 trillion) is unlikely to be an issue this year as low as interest rates remain low, as most forecasters expect.But deglobalisation is proving to be a major threat to the global economy. Societe\u0026nbspGenerale\u0026nbsp(Soc Gen) has warned that financial globalisation is at a “tipping point”, highlighting the possibility of stagnation and even a slow decline in production links between economies.‘Alarm bells ring’ as factory output falls at fastest rate in 7 yearsSoc Gen, which forecasts global growth slowing from 3.2 per cent to 3.1 per cent between 2020 and 2021, says financial globalisation has slowed significantly. Annual cross-border capital flows have decreased by more than 60 per cent compared to the peak in 2007.There is a similar problem with the trade in goods. According to the World Trade Organisation, its member states slapped protective measures on $747bn\u0026nbsp(£571bn) of goods in the year to October, a 27 per cent annual increase and the largest since 2012.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The first (unauthorised) adaptation of Bram Stoker\u0027s Dracula is a masterful presentation of the Victorian fears the vampire represents - xenophobia, disease, female sexuality and death.Guillermo del Toro has made a career out of dreaming up all kinds of creatures – some nice, others not so – and the Reapers in Blade II fit firmly in the latter category. They’re a deadlier breed of vampire (yes, in this film you can be even more dead than the undead) and, perhaps even more terrifyingly, the lead carrier is played by Luke Goss.“You’ll never see anything like The Thing ever again,” John Carpenter once said of his 1982 sci-fi horror. Many critics at the time would have responded, “Good.” Upon its release, the film – which centres around a mysterious, malformed humanoid discovered buried in ice, that consumes and assimilates anything in its way – was met with a barrage of negative reviews. Critics decried it as “bereft, despairing and nihilistic”, but over time, those traits have become its greatest strengths. Plus, there are tentacles, slime and dismembered body parts.As mogwai, they\u0027re unbelievably cute. But feed them after midnight and you\u0027ll be faced with these slimy little terrors, with their triangular faces, sharp teeth and penchant for mayhem. (JS)There are few scenes more horrific than Jeff Goldblum completing his metamorphosis into the gloopy, eponymous fly, in Cronenberg\u0027s classic. Whether you see King Kong as a rampaging monster or a tragic antihero, the ape has become one of the most famous movie icons in history and has appeared in dozens of films, video games, comics and books since his debut in the original 1933 classic. (EH)820 The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954)This strange prehistoric beast from 1954’s Creature from the Black Lagoon lurks in the depths of a dark lake in the Amazonian jungle. It doesn’t take too kindly to a group of scientists’ attempts to capture it and bring it back to civilisation for testing. (EH)The Pale Man only appears in one scene in Pan’s Labyrinth, but has understandably been burned into the collective memories of everyone who’s seen it. A child-eating ghoul with loose skin and eyeballs lodged in his palms, he remains Guillermo Del Toro’s most disarming and terrifying creation.This slimy-skinned creature with an appetite for small children is yet another movie monster that emerges from the depths of a body of water – in this case the Han River in South Korea. In the 2006 film The Host, the strange amphibian kidnaps a local man’s daughter and the story follows his desperate attempts to rescue her. (EH)These little red-eyed furballs from outer space can eat you quicker than a school of piranhas and shoot darts from their forehead. Fun fact: a young  Leonardo DiCaprio appeared in Critters 3 (1991). (JS)1220 Little Shop of Horrors (1986)There is a silly sort of charm at the heart of The Little Shop of Horrors, which stars Rick Moranis as a nervous florist, and the voice of Levi Stubbs as a singing, man-eating plant called Audrey II. The film is more nerdy than nightmarish, and is all the better for it. (AP)OK, the monsters of Monsters, Inc – an animated Pixar film in which children’s screams generate the city’s power – are far less nightmarish than some of the entries here. Some of them, in fact, are downright cute – not least John Goodman’s blue-furred, gentle giant Sulley. But Randall Boggs, a conniving chameleon as slimy as his name suggests, is brilliantly creepy. (AP)Michael Keaton’s bio-exorcist turns the Deetz residence into a house of horrors after transforming into a leery stop-motion reptilian creature in a scene that, despite its placement in the middle of the Tim Burton comedy, remains a pretty unsettling watch. (JS)The creatures that terrorise Kevin Bacon can best be identified as land sharks. That\u0027s how writers SS Wilson and Brent Maddock pitched the idea to director Ron Underwood, who used his knowledge of nature (he was a documentary filmmaker for National Geographic at the time) to translate the monster into one hell of an on-screen terror. (JS)Although this creature, which crashes onto Earth inside a meteorite, is described as an alien amoeboidal entity, it is essentially a giant blob that rolls around town, devouring everybody in its wake. In other words, it’s not going to go down as one of the most creatively imagined monsters in cinema, but the fact it gets bigger with each person killed is a pretty scary thought. (JS)Sometimes a metaphor for nuclear war, but often a giant spiky-backed friend to all, Godzilla is both the scariest and loveliest of cinema’s monsters. Through 35 movies and countless video games, TV series and comic books, Godzilla has been as willing to crush skyscrapers with aplomb as he is eager to rescue humanity. He’s the kind of creature you’d want to bring home to your parents is what we’re saying, if you were in a scenario in which dating Godzilla was an option. (AW)Because it feels important to reiterate every once in a while to remind us of how good we once had it, there was once a film in which Arnold Schwarzenegger faced off against an invisible, dreadlocked alien in the jungle outside Guatemala. It was Predator, and it was terrifying. (AW)Not Frankenstein, as you will have been endlessly reminded by your teachers when you were 11 and reading Mary Shelley for the first time in English. Like many of the monsters on this list, Frankenstein’s Monster is also a master of transformation: sometimes a deformed mutant, other times incredibly charismatic – in a desperately-wants-to-eat-your-brain kind of way. Eternally spooky, however. (AW)The monsters at the centre of the Alien franchise are so terrifying because they’re oddly biological – all ooze and acid and jutting parts, with phallic things protruding out of them and shiny heads like the backs of cockroaches. They are grim, crawling around like interpretive dance students dressed in black latex and equally as terrifying. Thank God, then, for Sigourney Weaver, who has never met a Xenomorph she hasn’t been able to take down with a trusty flamethrower or through the use of a giant bit of wearable tech. If she’s not available, though… then the best of luck to you. (AW)He comes out of a pop-up book, announces himself with three knocks at the door, and it’s seemingly impossible to get rid of him once he sets his sights on you… The Babadook isn’t just a perfect movie monster, he also ascended to the rank of unexpected queer icon thanks to Tumblr. The first (unauthorised) adaptation of Bram Stoker\u0027s Dracula is a masterful presentation of the Victorian fears the vampire represents - xenophobia, disease, female sexuality and death.Guillermo del Toro has made a career out of dreaming up all kinds of creatures – some nice, others not so – and the Reapers in Blade II fit firmly in the latter category. They’re a deadlier breed of vampire (yes, in this film you can be even more dead than the undead) and, perhaps even more terrifyingly, the lead carrier is played by Luke Goss.“You’ll never see anything like The Thing ever again,” John Carpenter once said of his 1982 sci-fi horror. Many critics at the time would have responded, “Good.” Upon its release, the film – which centres around a mysterious, malformed humanoid discovered buried in ice, that consumes and assimilates anything in its way – was met with a barrage of negative reviews. Critics decried it as “bereft, despairing and nihilistic”, but over time, those traits have become its greatest strengths. Plus, there are tentacles, slime and dismembered body parts.As mogwai, they\u0027re unbelievably cute. But feed them after midnight and you\u0027ll be faced with these slimy little terrors, with their triangular faces, sharp teeth and penchant for mayhem. (JS)There are few scenes more horrific than Jeff Goldblum completing his metamorphosis into the gloopy, eponymous fly, in Cronenberg\u0027s classic. Whether you see King Kong as a rampaging monster or a tragic antihero, the ape has become one of the most famous movie icons in history and has appeared in dozens of films, video games, comics and books since his debut in the original 1933 classic. (EH)820 The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954)This strange prehistoric beast from 1954’s Creature from the Black Lagoon lurks in the depths of a dark lake in the Amazonian jungle. It doesn’t take too kindly to a group of scientists’ attempts to capture it and bring it back to civilisation for testing. (EH)The Pale Man only appears in one scene in Pan’s Labyrinth, but has understandably been burned into the collective memories of everyone who’s seen it. A child-eating ghoul with loose skin and eyeballs lodged in his palms, he remains Guillermo Del Toro’s most disarming and terrifying creation.This slimy-skinned creature with an appetite for small children is yet another movie monster that emerges from the depths of a body of water – in this case the Han River in South Korea. In the 2006 film The Host, the strange amphibian kidnaps a local man’s daughter and the story follows his desperate attempts to rescue her. (EH)These little red-eyed furballs from outer space can eat you quicker than a school of piranhas and shoot darts from their forehead. Fun fact: a young  Leonardo DiCaprio appeared in Critters 3 (1991). (JS)1220 Little Shop of Horrors (1986)There is a silly sort of charm at the heart of The Little Shop of Horrors, which stars Rick Moranis as a nervous florist, and the voice of Levi Stubbs as a singing, man-eating plant called Audrey II. The film is more nerdy than nightmarish, and is all the better for it. (AP)OK, the monsters of Monsters, Inc – an animated Pixar film in which children’s screams generate the city’s power – are far less nightmarish than some of the entries here. Some of them, in fact, are downright cute – not least John Goodman’s blue-furred, gentle giant Sulley. But Randall Boggs, a conniving chameleon as slimy as his name suggests, is brilliantly creepy. (AP)Michael Keaton’s bio-exorcist turns the Deetz residence into a house of horrors after transforming into a leery stop-motion reptilian creature in a scene that, despite its placement in the middle of the Tim Burton comedy, remains a pretty unsettling watch. (JS)The creatures that terrorise Kevin Bacon can best be identified as land sharks. That\u0027s how writers SS Wilson and Brent Maddock pitched the idea to director Ron Underwood, who used his knowledge of nature (he was a documentary filmmaker for National Geographic at the time) to translate the monster into one hell of an on-screen terror. (JS)Although this creature, which crashes onto Earth inside a meteorite, is described as an alien amoeboidal entity, it is essentially a giant blob that rolls around town, devouring everybody in its wake. In other words, it’s not going to go down as one of the most creatively imagined monsters in cinema, but the fact it gets bigger with each person killed is a pretty scary thought. (JS)Sometimes a metaphor for nuclear war, but often a giant spiky-backed friend to all, Godzilla is both the scariest and loveliest of cinema’s monsters. Through 35 movies and countless video games, TV series and comic books, Godzilla has been as willing to crush skyscrapers with aplomb as he is eager to rescue humanity. He’s the kind of creature you’d want to bring home to your parents is what we’re saying, if you were in a scenario in which dating Godzilla was an option.

Undergraduates aged between 18 and 19 are 25 per cent less likely to be in work than they were in the early 2000s.\u0026nbspMs Gardiner added: “With young people today expected to end their working lives at a later age than previous generations, it\u0027s understandable that they want to start their working lives at a later age too.“But this lack of work experience can create longer-term problems, particularly if they hit other life milestones like motherhood or ill-health before their careers have got off the ground.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Maybe in an attempt to avoid similar controversy to that which the comedian has courted in the past, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) has ordered the comedian to be on better behaviour\u0026nbspfor this year’s opening monologue.Will he listen? That remains to be seen – although much of the promotion of this year’s ceremony has been centred on the fact this will be Gervais’ fifth and final time as host, so he won’t exactly be looking to go out with a whimper.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGervais isn’t the only host to have cut down Hollywood’s elite with some shocking one liners, though. Both Tina Fey and Amy Poehler did so not too long ago – for three consecutive years, no less – and Seth Meyers had the tough task of hosting the year after the news of Harvey Weinstein’s harassment allegations came to light.Ahead of this year’s Golden Globes ceremony, we run through some of the most shocking jokes, ranging from one-liners about Leonardo DiCaprio,\u0026nbspGeorge Clooney and several about Mel Gibson.Click through the bellow gallery to see what made the listCreated with Sketch. Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Looking at all the wonderful faces here today reminds me of the great work that’s been done this year –\u0026nbspby cosmetic surgeons. I hope I haven’t offended anyone. It’s not my fault. I like a drink as much as the next man. Unless the next man is Mel Gibson. It’s going to be a night of partying and heavy drinking – or, as Charlie Sheen calls it, breakfast.”  It was a big year for 3D movies: Toy Story, Despicable Me, Tron. It seemed like everything this year was three-dimensional. Except the characters in The Tourist. I already feel bad about that joke. I tell you what, I’m jumping on the bandwagon because I haven’t even seen The Tourist. Who has?” There were a lot of big films that didn’t get nominated this year. Nothing for Sex and the City 2. No, I was sure the Golden Globe for special effects would go to the team that airbrushed that poster. Great job. Girls, we know how old you are. I saw one of you in an episode of Bonanza. “What you don’t know about Colin Firth is he’s very racist. I mean, really nasty stuff. I’ve also seen him punch a little blind kitten. Please welcome the evil Colin Firth. Last year, our next presenter won both the Golden Globe and the Oscar for her work in Black Swan. This year, she took some time out to have a baby. Consequently, she’s been nominated for nothing. Really pathetic. The Golden Globes are to the Oscars what Kim Kardashian is to Kate Middleton: a bit louder, a bit trashier, a bit drunker and more easily bought – allegedly. Nothing’s been proved.  “For his role in Dallas Buyers Club, Matthew McConaughey lost 45 pounds. Or what actresses call, being in a movie.  The Wolf of Wall Street is another nominee tonight. I really loved the film, but some of it was too graphic. I mean, if I wanted to see Jonah Hill masturbate at a pool party, I’d go to one of Jonah Hill’s pool parties.”  “Gravity is nominated for Best Film. It’s the story of how George Clooney would rather float away into space and die than spend one more minute with a woman his own age.”  “Now, like a supermodel’s vagina, let’s say hello to Leonardo DiCaprio.”  Amal is a human rights lawyer who worked on the Enron case, was an adviser to Kofi Annan regarding Syria, and was selected to a three-person UN commission investigating rules of war violations in the Gaza Strip. So tonight, her husband is getting a lifetime achievement award.  “North Korea referred to The Interview as absolutely intolerable and a wanton act of terror. Even more amazing: not the worst review the movie got.”  Hello, I\u0027m Seth Rogen and I am currently trying to conceal a massive erection.All-female remakes are the big thing. There’s a female remake of Ghostbusters. There’s going to be a female remake of Ocean’s 11. And this is brilliant for the studios because they get guaranteed box office results and they don’t have to spend too much money on the cast.  I\u0027m going to be nice tonight. I’ve changed – not as much as Bruce Jenner. Obviously. Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course. What a year she’s had! She became a role model for trans-people everywhere, showing great bravery in breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers. But you can’t have everything, can you? Not at the same time.  The excellent Spotlight has been nominated. The Catholic Church are furious about the film as it exposes that 5 per cent of all their priests have repeatedly molested children and been allowed to continue to work without punishment. Roman Polanski called it \u0027the best date movie ever.\u0027  “When Brad and Angelina see Kevin Hart and Ken Jeong they’re gonna want to adopt them.”  Chung Sung-JunGetty Images for Disney“They tried to get a woman to host this show, they really did. They said, ‘Hey, how’d you like to come and be judged by some of the most powerful people in Hollywood?’ And they said, ‘Hmm, where is it?’ And they said, ‘It’s at a hotel.’ Long story short, I’m your host tonight.”    “Harvey Weinstein isn\u0027t in the room tonight. Don\u0027t worry, he\u0027ll be back in 20 years when he\u0027\u0027ll be the first person to be booed during the In Memoriam segment.”  Looking at all the wonderful faces here today reminds me of the great work that’s been done this year –\u0026nbspby cosmetic surgeons. I hope I haven’t offended anyone. It’s not my fault. I like a drink as much as the next man. Unless the next man is Mel Gibson. It’s going to be a night of partying and heavy drinking – or, as Charlie Sheen calls it, breakfast.”  It was a big year for 3D movies: Toy Story, Despicable Me, Tron. It seemed like everything this year was three-dimensional. Except the characters in The Tourist. I already feel bad about that joke. I tell you what, I’m jumping on the bandwagon because I haven’t even seen The Tourist. Who has?” There were a lot of big films that didn’t get nominated this year. Nothing for Sex and the City 2. No, I was sure the Golden Globe for special effects would go to the team that airbrushed that poster. Great job. Girls, we know how old you are. I saw one of you in an episode of Bonanza. “What you don’t know about Colin Firth is he’s very racist. I mean, really nasty stuff. I’ve also seen him punch a little blind kitten. Please welcome the evil Colin Firth. Last year, our next presenter won both the Golden Globe and the Oscar for her work in Black Swan. This year, she took some time out to have a baby. Consequently, she’s been nominated for nothing. Really pathetic. The Golden Globes are to the Oscars what Kim Kardashian is to Kate Middleton: a bit louder, a bit trashier, a bit drunker and more easily bought – allegedly. Nothing’s been proved.  “For his role in Dallas Buyers Club, Matthew McConaughey lost 45 pounds. Or what actresses call, being in a movie.  The Wolf of Wall Street is another nominee tonight. I really loved the film, but some of it was too graphic. I mean, if I wanted to see Jonah Hill masturbate at a pool party, I’d go to one of Jonah Hill’s pool parties.”  “Gravity is nominated for Best Film. It’s the story of how George Clooney would rather float away into space and die than spend one more minute with a woman his own age.”  “Now, like a supermodel’s vagina, let’s say hello to Leonardo DiCaprio.”  Amal is a human rights lawyer who worked on the Enron case, was an adviser to Kofi Annan regarding Syria, and was selected to a three-person UN commission investigating rules of war violations in the Gaza Strip. So tonight, her husband is getting a lifetime achievement award.  “North Korea referred to The Interview as absolutely intolerable and a wanton act of terror. Even more amazing: not the worst review the movie got.”  Hello, I\u0027m Seth Rogen and I am currently trying to conceal a massive erection.All-female remakes are the big thing. There’s a female remake of Ghostbusters. There’s going to be a female remake of Ocean’s 11. And this is brilliant for the studios because they get guaranteed box office results and they don’t have to spend too much money on the cast.  I\u0027m going to be nice tonight. I’ve changed – not as much as Bruce Jenner. Obviously. Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course. What a year she’s had! She became a role model for trans-people everywhere, showing great bravery in breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers. But you can’t have everything, can you? Not at the same time.  The excellent Spotlight has been nominated.

Minding the GapOne of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey MacnabAd Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab920 12. Happy as LazzaroA bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey MacnabBased on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob StolworthyNews coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed. In Waad Al-Kateab’s first person account of the uprising’s aftermath, her camera’s gaze never flinches from the horrors it sees – as she and her husband try to maintain a rebel hospital amid a reign of bombing from President al-Assad – but nor does it stop rolling while she falls in love, has a baby, and jokes around with her friends and neighbours. This is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is an important, powerful, astonishing documentary. Alex PollardIt feels almost blasphemous to be glad of Julianne Moore stepping down from a role, but Lee Israel – the cantankerous, lonely literary forger who found herself the target of an FBI investigation in the Nineties – feels like a part Melissa McCarthy was born to play. Nimbly directed by Marielle Heller (who was shunned by the Oscars in the Best Director category), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a sharp, funny and deeply compassionate examination of loneliness and self-destruction. Richard E Grant and Dolly Wells give wonderful supporting performances, too. Alex PollardAs deeply indebted to the teen movie genre as it is formally and narratively rebellious, Booksmart grounds its traditional night-before-graduation plot (teenagers eager to crash a party) in touching character-driven drama. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, both instant stars, convey the ever-shifting dynamics and heightened dramas of adolescent best-friendship perfectly. Behind the camera, meanwhile, actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde demonstrates a staggering amount of emotional empathy and technical mastery for someone so green. Adam WhiteComparisons to Martin Scorsese’s previous films (Goodfellas, Casino) are unfounded considering The Irishman is unlike any other gangster film you’ll see. With his three-hour-30-minute-long opus, Scorsese places the harsh spotlight on mortality. Instead of tracking the rise of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) from regular family man to seasoned hitman with glitzy panache, we see him shamefully confess his crimes as an elderly man ruminating on his past in a nursing home. The result is an unsettlingly moving character study unafraid to ask the big questions.​Jacob Stolworthy1520 6. Once Upon a Time in HollywoodWith his ninth feature, Quentin Tarantino took a breath and crafted an unhurried, oddly heartwarming fable, one that came with a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Its release rolled around with the usual smattering of discourse-steering controversy but, for all the complaints about the director’s depiction of his film star subjects, including the scant usage of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the fact remains that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the filmmaker’s most accomplished films – a free’n’easy sun-soaked delve into Sixties Hollywood, whose much-discussed final 20 minutes provided topics of conversation all summer long. Jacob StolworthyFor too many years the internet was exclusively evil in movies, something for tech boffins to hack, or used to steal Sandra Bullock’s identity. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade felt so comparatively real because it felt like the real internet, which has been as toxic and terrifying as it has been helpful to a generation of young people. Elsie Fisher, as a 13-year-old girl chronicling her confidence and anxieties in a vlog, is an adorable delight here, in a film that is devastatingly, heartbreakingly and endearingly human. Adam WhiteYorgos Lanthimos’s delightful, subversive vision has shaken the cobwebs out of costume drama. Set in the 18th century, it follows a trio of women – two cousins, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone), and the ruling Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) – as they vie for power over each other and England. Desire, savagery, and manipulative vulnerability all become weapons in the hands of those who have no choice but to fight dirty. But, then, Colman’s childless, gout-ridden Queen Anne tenderly reveals her shattered soul – it’s an Academy Award-winning performance that brings a slice of tragedy to an otherwise sublime farce. Clarisse LoughreyThe marriage of disparate talents united to ensure If Beale Street Could Talk is worthy of mention alongside Barry Jenkins’ previous film, Moonlight – The Independent’s film of the decade. With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob StolworthyHere is a love story about orce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless orce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex PollardGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is. Alex Pollard120 20.

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Gambling companies pay referral fees to intermediaries who can find new customers that may turn into lucrative regular players.Online gambling group 888 takes £15m punt on BetBrightTom Watson labels problem gambling as a ‘public health emergency’Will bookies millions to address problem gambling buy off critics?This week, the extent to which gambling companies’ multibillion-pound profits rely on problem gamblers was revealed in a report obtained , which showed that one firm collected 83 per cent of its deposits from just 2 per cent of its customers.A Google spokesperson said: “We support responsible gambling advertising and it’s important to us that people see useful and relevant ads in this area.\u0026nbsp“As such, we have strict policies around gambling ads, which we enforce rigorously. We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In doing so, they claim to have created the world\u0027s most efficient lithium-sulfur battery.“The world needs radical new\u0026nbspenergy storage technologies to fight climate change,” Dr Mahdokht\u0026nbspShaibani\u0026nbspfrom Monash University’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, who led the research, told\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Lithium-sulfur batteries, which use extremely high-capacity sulfur, can store five-times as much capacity as traditional lithium-ion batteries, and are made from cheap materials that are available worldwide.”Associate Professor Matthew Hill added: “This approach not only favours high performance metrics and long life cycle... it is also can lead to significant reductions in environmentally hazardous waste.”Battery breakthrough revolutionises recharge times for electric carsThe research, which is published in\u0026nbspScience Advances, could be a major milestone for the battery industry and could impact everything from consumer electronics to solar grids.Dr Shaibani\u0026nbspsaid the commercialisation of the batteries may be between two to four years away, and a\u0026nbsppatent for the manufacturing process has already been approved.Prototype cells have been developed in Germany and further testing in cars and solar grids is set to take place in Australia this year.“Cost projections and performance metrics of our technology predicts for outperforming today’s lithium-ion batteries at high competitive price points,” said Dr Shaibani.\u0026nbsp“Altogether, this means that solar power could be much more easily stored, or an electric vehicle go a lot further, but more importantly, the battery is safe, simple and ethical.”​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We need contact — and not just emotional — but physical.There’s even a psychological term for it, skin hunger.People are responding to this tech-driven disconnect by seeking out physical contact in any way they can.The most obvious example is the rise of hugging.There’s a lot more hugging as a greeting between men than there used to be, even between sporting opponents.And what on earth happened to the stand-offish Brits  Great British Bake Off contestants spend nearly as much time holding hands and wrapping their arms around each other as they do baking.We have become so hungry for touch that we don’t even need a human partner.The odds are that someone you know will have received a weighted blanket for Christmas.It is essentially a duvet cover filled with plastic or glass pellets or beads.Manufacturers say the even pressure they exert on your body promotes the release of well-being chemical serotonin and sleep hormone melatonin, while reducing stress-related hormone cortisol.In plain language we’re talking about feeling the comfort and security of being cradled, evenit’s by a blanket rather than in the arms of a loved one.For those who want to take the experience of being hugged to a whole new level, Otonamaki, the Japanese practice of adult swaddling, will become popular in .After getting into a foetal position, the client is bound tightly in sheets, then gently rocked for  minutes.I ran across a tweet not long ago that read: “My phone just said, ‘Welcome home’, and I instinctively replied, ‘I love you’. Then I realised I meant it.”We may be interacting with our fellow humans less often, but we’re more than making up for it with digital interactions, even to the point of developing feelings for these devices.As our devices get smarter and master the intricacies of natural language processing, we will increasingly see them as confidants, friends and even romantic partners.Already people are interacting with chatbots instead of flesh-and-blood therapists.And we’re seeing all sorts of digital apps promising to improve our mental health, from Moodfit and MoodMission to Happy.As developers figure out how to make our smart devices ever more personable, it doesn’t take a soothsayer to recognise that a global population increasingly suffering from loneliness and disconnectedness will find solutions of a sort in these gadgets.The desire for clean air in cities will not only lead to pricier houses on less polluted streets but tourists will give up city breaks for holidays in the country, where the air is good.As living in places with clean air becomes a luxury with a high price tag, expect new takes on face masks to become a must-have item for people in cities and a race towards rural living.Expect an explosion of products, from vegan leather to plant-based burgers and articial wood.If you buy a vegan burger and cook it at home, you have consumed a burger made with eight times less water and CO than a conventional beef burger.These sorts of products may be described as “fake” but the feelings people get of having made an ethically better choice are very real.Uncertainty begets fear, so look out for a rise in preppers — survivalists preparing for Armageddon.In the US, prepping is mainstream enough for Costco to sell a £, one-year stockpile of survival food for four.Survivalists are at the extreme end of the bunker trend.More mainstream are the millions who aren’t worried enough to go all-out prepper but still view the outside world as a threat.Driven by concerns about personal security and terrorism, CCTV covering public and commercial spaces is becoming a global norm.London is sixth in the world for TV surveillance, the only non-Chinese city in the top eight.And sales of home video surveillance on smartphones, courtesy of Google Nest, Ring and Wyze Cam, are booming.The global market is expected to rise from £billion to £billion by .Expect the self-tracking trend to run and run.For more and more people, there’s something irresistible about gadgets that put statistics to common everyday activities.For things that can’t yet be tracked automatically, they can input data manually — MyMoodTracker for emotions, MyNetDiary for nutrition and PoopLog for toilet visits.Google announced it intended to buy Fitbit for nearly £billion, prompting some to say they will ditch their device out of concern that Google will sell their health data to insurance companies.But rather than wait to buy third-party data, insurance companies are already getting into the game.: Single, professional women will become the new free-spending yuppies.: Publishes a study of the soft modern male, who she described as “metrosexual man”.: Predicts “sleep is the new sex” and “clean eating”. Forecasts the sub-prime crisis that led to the  financial crash.: Identies a new “snowflake” mindset where “everybody wants to save the Earth but no one wants to help Mum with the dishes”.: Identies Daddy bloggers as more fathers bring up kids.: Forecasts the rise of “truthiness” – where facts seem to matter little.: Predicts rise of gender-neutral society. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He designed it, built it then realised it was far too savage and bitey to live in, say, Milton Keynes.Or the poisonous redback spider which likes to hide under lavatory seats so it can bite a man’s penis when he sits down to do his number twos. No way could God have that living in Europe or the US.He also made a lot of snakes. Some are very pretty and some are very impressive.But occasionally it all went wrong and he ended up with something that could kill a fully-grown man with one small bite. And again, these could not live in populated areas.He needed a home for all these things, so he made Australia.And to make sure people didn’t go there, he put a huge coral reef on the approaches and filled the interior with a sea of sand that goes on for ever.He even used this remote outpost to house some of his more ridiculous ideas. Stuff he came up with when he was drunk.Like those birds that can’t fly and that otter with a beak.Then you have the kangaroo, which gets about by bouncing, and the koala, which is permanently stoned and catches chlamydiaanyone ever picks it up.For millions of years, this big, sandy cupboard under the stairs went unnoticed.But then along came Captain Cook and now the world knows all about Oz and its stupid, dangerous creatures.Plainly, God is embarrassed. Because he’s decided to set fire to it.It’s been argued the fires raging across the country were caused by global warming or out-of-control barbies.But when you look at the footage, you know something biblical is going on.Those things are huge.Skies have been turned red by the flames. Choking smoke is blanketing millions of acres.Thousands of homes have been obliterated. And people are dying.This has happened before in recent years and there’s no doubt it will happen again.Which means people must accept that Australia isn’t meant for human habitation.Soyou’re reading this down there, please come home.You’ll like it. It never stops raining. And we are better at sport.DURING World War Two, General de Gaulle used London as a base and to say a belated thank you, current president Emmanuel Macron is thinking of giving the city France’s highest award for honour.Needless to say, lots of people are now jumping up and down in Paris saying the Legion d’Honneur cannot possibly be given to London as England and France are “hereditary enemies”.No we aren’t. Germany is our hereditary enemy and not just on the football pitch.France, meanwhile, is just some place we visit to buy cheese and wine.We have no idea what it’s like to fight France because it always surrenders before the battle’s got going.ALL of us begin a new decade with hope in our hearts that it’ll be better than the past one.Not me. This is thanks to two things.Firstly, there’s Libya. Since they shoved a scaffolding pole up Colonel Gaddafi’s bottom, it has been a lawless haven for terrorists and lunatics.Today it’s run by factions of the Judean People’s Front and the Popular Front For Judea, with one backed by Turkey and Qatar and the other backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.There’s going to be a bloodbath. And this is a country less than  miles from mainland Europe.Which means we are going to have to get involved. Becausewe don’t, Russia will.That’s one reason, then, that I fear for the coming decade.The other is that at some point in the next ten years, statistically speaking, I am likely to die.TWENTY years ago, Britain created the perfect argument for not allowing anything to be nationalised or run by the Government.It was called The Dome.Created to mark the end of a millennium, it cost £million and was filled by right-on frizzy haired vegans with things no one wanted to see.There was a plastic human you could walk through, a multi-faith zone and lots of global warming malarkey.Unsurprisingly, it was a spectacular flop.So after a year, it was given away to a property company which turned it into the O, a music venue that now rakes in £million a year. Led Zeppelin had their reunion there.As I’ve always said, governments should put up park benches and run the nuclear submarines.And that’s it. Everything  should be run by the private sector.AS we all trudge back to work, with the fog making our hair frizzy and the puddles reminding us we need some new shoes, we will develop a teeth-rattling hatred for all those celebrities on Instagram who are frolicking in the Caribbean or sipping green juices on a beach in the Males.Amanda Holden. Pippa Middleton. Myleene Klass. Grrrr.Except,you think about it, you and I don’t have to find someone to put sun cream on our back five times a day.We aren’t being eaten alive by mosquitoes. And while a wet pavement isn’t very romantic, it’s better than hopping about, yelping, on a superheated white beach.Also, we will not have dicky tummies from the weird food, bad heads from the cocktails, puffy eyes from the jet lag and the constant worry we’ve been papped while bending over.And what’s more, we didn’t have to spend half an hour at an airport waiting for someone in a high-visibility jacket to take an X-ray photograph of our genitals.TECHNICALLY speaking, the fabulous goal scored by Wolves against Liverpool last weekend was not a goal at all.Because careful examination of the footage showed one of the players involved in the build-up was offside by .mm.It may have been three in the morning. The road may have been empty and the skies clear. And there’s no way you should have to waste a day on a speed awareness course as a result.But technology means we live in a time when there is no grey area. Pity.Many of the kids were explaining how they’d given up meat to save the planet and that Greta Thunberg may be Mrs Jesus.But then, instead of actually going walking, they stayed in the car, running its V diesel engine to keep warm.I WAS asked the other dayI’d be starting the year by doing Veganuary.FINALLY, may I wish everyone a very happy New Year.And extend a big thank you to Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott for making such a thing likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it had to act rapidly.Iranian reprisals may be inevitable.But standing back hasn’t done the West much good.The mullahs at least now need to factor in a US President who’s more ruthless than the last.Three days ago Ayatollah Khamenei taunted him over the storming of the US embassy in Baghdad. “You can’t do anything,” he sneered.Trump’s put him straight there.  WHAT is this spell Labour’s Jess Phillips casts over Blairites and media pundits  We don’t get it.We do not doubt her hard work, nor that her heart is in the right place.Many naively believe her Brummie accent makes her the true voice of the working-class — this middle-class, grammar-schooled daughter of an NHS executive and a teacher.But that’s not our real beef. It’s the toe-curling, overwrought Commons monologues designed for social media.And the needlessly vitriolic and hysterical Twitter rants.Consider this gem: “The greatest lie ever told is that Boris is likeable, with cut-through outside ­London.” That aged well, as they say.Phillips may yet be Labour’s best hope as leader, God help them.But to be seen as a serious politician, she should start acting like one. IT is obvious the teenager convicted of lying about her gang-rape in Cyprus signed a bogus dictated confession under duress.Its dodgy English smacks of a foreign cop, not an articulate young Brit.The Foreign Office must act.

During Alan’s treatment, they chatted about all the animals that need help with their teeth — prompting Paul to offer his services.He says: “Alan showed me an image of a bear whose mouth was full of abscesses. I said, ‘I can’t believe there’s no one who can help him — these teeth need treating’.”Paul rang specialist veterinary dentist Lisa Milella for advice and the Surrey expert offered to help. Since then, the duo have spent their holidays providing treatment to a menagerie of exotic creatures.This year the charity travelled to Armenia to help bears rescued from harrowing conditions. Historically, Armenians kept a caged bear in front of an office as a display of wealth. When the country outlawed the practice, IAR saved two dozen bears, including Maximus and Minimus, from a bus stop.Alongside specialist Gerhard Putter, Paul spent seven hours fixing Maximus’ teeth then several more hours on Minimus. The pair now live in the charity’s sanctuary, with plenty of room to exercise and behave naturally. But Paul says nothing compares with performing root-canal work on Mohan, the Royal Bengal tiger.One of the big cat’s canine teeth had a severe abscess, causing poison to spread around the creature’s face — a potentially fatal infection.Paul says of the st cat: “Mohan is the biggest animal I’ve treated and when I saw him laid out on that table, I hoped he didn’t wake up! When I opened his mouth, it was cavernous. I put my hand against his paw and it dwarfed mine.”Mohan was in agony when he arrived — and very angry.Paul says: “We removed his upper-left canine and drained the abscess. Within  hours, his appetite came back and his foul mood lted.”Helping free the animals from pain motivates Paul and his team. He says with a laugh: “I’ve drilled the teeth of some scary animals in my time but some human patients are even scarier. I’ve never been bitten by any of these creatures but, believe me, some children bite hard!”After several trips to the vet about stomach and teeth issues, Maud was diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma.Holly, , who works in the tech industry, launched a crowd­funding appeal and, three months later, the puss is responding well.Holly says: “Every person who donated has given Maud a leline.”See Maud’s Instagram @FuriousMaud.ELENA-ALICE EDWARDS, , from Northampton, has a three-year-old corn snake called Kelloggs.

If she’s really troubled about racism in the Labour Party, why did she spend the past three years campaigning to get anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn into Number  Andshe’s a serious contender for the leadership, why does she spend half her time doing interviews about herself for glossy magazines Yes, personal brand is important. Butthe country is really in the state Jess claims, shouldn’t she be busy fixing it The Labour leadership contender is determined to paint herself as “likeable” and “relatable” but, right now, she’s coming across as a vacuous narcissist. And a slippery one at that.The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn has so far involved the candidates hamming up their northern accents, trying to out-working class each other, or desperately bigging up their woke credentials to the Press.No one has yet adopted a whippet or done a Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP and potential leadership hopeful who this week described herself out as “pansexual” — attracted to people regardless of sex — but it won’t be long now.For the casual bystander, it all makes for a good laugh. Emily Thornberry’s hysterical claim that her family was once so poor they had to put down a cat sounded so ridiculous in her cut-glass accent, it distracted commentators fromAngela Rayner’s far more legitimate tales of hardship — much to the comical irritation of the latter.For anyone serious about rebuilding the opposition, though, this farcical leadership race is no joke.While Labour contorts itself into a web of wokeness, the Conservatives are quietly cementing their new blue wall in the North.Why  Because outside leftie London and a few university towns, no one cares about tick-box ersity or even the le stories of politicians.Yes, having a “powerful backstory” is usefulyou want to make self-indulgent MPs weepy in the Commons, but it won’t persuade voters that you’re capable of getting things done.And as Boris Johnson proved so decisively last month, getting things done is what counts.The Eton and Oxford-educated Prime Minister looks and sounds nothing like most of the voters in Bishop Auckland or Redcar, but he persuaded them that he was serious about pulling Britain out of a rut.That, it turned out, was enough for an -seat majority.DOMINIC CUMMINGS is spot on: What this country needs is some more nerds.Stuffing the Civil Service full of people who meet gender and ersity quotas is all very well, butyou want employees who bring a fresh perspective, you need recruits who actually think dferently.A tech-obsessed -year-old who skipped university to pursue a career in coding could teach Whitehall’s swarms of humanities graduates a thing or two. And anyone prepared to give up a social le to work for the Government would likely do a far better job than the current civil servants who knock off at pm on a Friday.Bring on the geeks.The Opposition should now take a leaf out of his book.The last election was calamitous, yes, but with  per cent of the vote, Labour is still the second-largest party in British politics.That’s a powerful base for a recoveryit picks the right leader.The challenge is finding that person. As things stand, the field isn’t inspiring.Rebecca Long-Bailey — though a box-ticking superstar — doesn’t have the demonstrable competence that voters are yearning for from Labour.And poisonous Thornberry, who once tweeted a sneering comment about a Rochester home decorated with English flags, will repel patriotic voters.Butthe party is prepared to ditch the ersity nonsense and ignore pious pundits shrieking that the new leader “must be a woman”, the picture is rosier.The unbearably smug Keir Starmer — key player in the doomed People’s Vote campaign — would go down like a ton of bricks in Leave-voting areas.But someone like Dan Jarvis, who has called for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era, may just have what it takes.Under Corbyn, Labour proved once and for all that wokeness doesn’t win elections.With the exception of naive students and hipster Londoners, voters don’t much care whether their politicians wear flat caps, headscarves or top hats. They just want politicians who are unafraid to act.So now MPs have a choice.Either they nominate duds with tear-jerking back- stories and shore up their majority in Putney — the right-on London seat which provided the only cause for celebration last time.Or they change tack, abandon wokery, and unearth a strong, competent leader, who might be up to the mammoth task of rebuilding the broken party.It really couldn’t be simpler.PO-FACED leftie commentators must stop laying in to journalists who call Boris “Boris” .They’ve been fighting a losing battle for years. And rightly so.Given Johnson is the third most common surname in the UK, it’s practical – not chummy – to call the Prime Minister by his much rarer Christian name.But, more importantly, the fact our PM is known by his first name on the world stage should be a source of pride to Brits.After three dreary years of Theresa May, Boris’s gravitas and quirky iniduality could hardly be more refreshing.It’s time to embrace it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many of our New Year resolutions are about dieting and fitness. We set our new Apple watches and Fitbits to unrealistic targets – and beat ourselves up in front of the mirror when we don’t hit them. Surely we all already know that fad diets don’t work. And that we won’t stick to running a mile a day for the next few months. Heck,diet and fitness regimes worked we’d be a nation of happy, healthy, rosy-cheeked utopians. The very word regime has scary militaristic overtones. All of this talk of health and weight, particularly at this time of year, merely sets us up to fail. Because while we are all gaining inches and pounds gradually as a nation the latest stats tell us we are also developing an ­epidemic of eating disorders. Hospital admissions have risen by more than a third across all ages for anorexia. The most common age of sufferers was  to  last year. There were ten cases among boys and six among girls of nine and under. This suggests we don’t know how to handle our relationship with food and we are ­developing this imbalance so early in our lives that our kids are destined to be either too fat, obsessed with yo-yo dieting, or in and out of anorexia and bulimia clinics during their lives. Meanwhile, as a Sunday People ­investigation reveals, some websites are ­entreating us to follow diets designed to help us shed pounds no matter how extreme our weight-loss goals may be. We have to educate ourselves and our kids about how we are abusing ourselves through the very thing that gives us le – food. Those of us who care about the planet are being implored to change our diets to save the world.  Veganuary lasted four days for me. I gave in to a toasted cheese sandwich.

The Shadow Brexit Secretary revealed his leadership bid speaking exclusively to the Sunday Mirror and admits Labour face an “uphill struggle” against Boris Johnson ’s Commons majority.But he says the party must hold the Tory government to account for the promises they made before the election. The Shadow Brexit Secretary will  launch his campaign during a visit to Brexit-backing Stevenage. Tonight he released a video featuring Doreen Lawrence, the mother of murdered Steven Lawrence - telling the story of his career including his work as a legal advisor to the National Union of Mineworkers , environmental activists and people fighting the poll tax. “I’m proud to be announcing by candidacy for the Labour leadership in the Sunday Mirror today,” he said.  “Over the coming weeks, I’m looking forward to getting back on the campaign trail and talking to people from across the country about how Labour can rebuild and win. “Britain desperately needs a Labour Government. We need a Labour Government that will offer people hope of a better future. “However, that is only going to happenLabour listens to people about what needs to change and how we can restore trust in our party as a force for good.” Sir Keir became the fth Labour MP to formally throw their hat in the ring for the top job. Friday night saw both Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy launch their campaigns. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry and Shadow Economics Minister Clive Lewis had already officially declared. Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long Bailey, a Jeremy Corbyn ally favoured on the left of the party, is still “seriously considering” whether to run for the leadership - as is party chairman Ian Lavery, who is also close to Mr Corbyn.But London MP David Lammy ruled himself out of the race on Saturday. He said: “I’m committed to playing my full part in opposition, but we need the candidate best placed to unite our party’s factions so we can win the country’s trust.” Ms Phillips visited the Bury North constituency that fell from Labour to the Tories to meet former supporters who did not back the party in the last election.

I know how much Labour supporters are hurting. The General Election result was ­devastating because we know the untold damage Boris Johnson will do to our country over the next five years. More insecure work, more families left dependent on food banks, union rights slashed and patients left waiting on hospital trolleys in ­overcrowded AEs. We cannot bury our heads in the sand – Labour must rebuild and fast. We have to restore trust in our party as a force for change and a force for good. The millions of people who needed change at the last ­election still need change. The moral fight against poverty, inequality and ­injustice must continue.  But as we rebuild, we must not lose sight of our values or retreat from the radicalism of the past few years. We must be the party of anti-austerity and investment in our public services. We must push for a Green New Deal to tackle the climate crisis, demand dignity at the heart of our social security system and make the case for a radically transformed economy that empowers trade unions and communities that have been left behind. And we should lead the fight for peace and justice around the world with a human rights approach to foreign policy and international ­relations.  The importance of this has become clear in the past few days. Ministers are failing to hold an ­irresponsible US President to account. The Government’s response to Donald Trump’s dangerous actions in Iran is not good enough. We face an uphill struggle. The Tories now have a majority in ­Parliament, overwhelming media support and a huge financial ­advantage. But we have to take the fight to them.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSitting next to a startled rape victim, Lisa Nandy looked in to her eyes and made a solemn promise to make her le better. Left emotionally and physically scarred, the young woman faced having her benefits stopped unless she agreed to a physical medical exam which proved she was unable to work. Enraged, Nandy says it fuelled the seminal moment when, as a new MP in , she first found her voice.The Labour Leader contender, , said: “This young lady had been traumatised by the horric rape she had suffered.The way she’d been treated by the benefits system had compounded that. “When she told me she had to undergo a medical exam I just thought ‘over my dead body’. “There’s something about Parliament that can be very intimidating when you first arrive. You need to find your confidence really quickly, otherwise you can’t make change and it was her terrible story which made me find my voice.  “I told Theresa May thatshe got one more letter asking her for an exam I would raise hell and the issue was sorted.She was given two years without being sent any more letters and got the head space she needed to recover. “I didn’t feel apologetic about taking up time or forcing things onto the agenda. In many ways this young woman made me feel I didn’t have a right not to. That was a game changer for me.”Nandy has thrown her hat into the ring as Jeremy Corbyn ’s replacement. Today it’s hard to imagine that the chatty, humorous mother-of-one ever struggled with voicing her views Boris Johnson is not to be trusted, regional devolution of powers is a good thing, the north’s transport system needs improving.Above all , Labour needs a new focus after it’s “devastating” defeat to the Tories and, living in its Northern heartlands, she is the woman “with skin in the game”. She says she will not move to Londonshe wins the race . “If the Labour leader cannot live in Wigan and travel for work in London, then there’s something wrong with Labour and the country.”  Like many female MPs, Nandy has been subject to misogynistic and political abuse but also about her Indian heritage. Her father Dipak is a Marxist academic who helped draw up the race relations act – meaning she has also been subjected to racism. She refuses to be cowed by threats saying: “I won’t let them stop me. “What is the alternative for this countrypeople, particularly women , can be hounded out of public le through violence, abuse and fear ” She lives with her partner, PR man Andy Collis, and their four-year-old son.When Nandy took a soft Brexit approach to Europe, advocating we leave the European Union but keep close ties with our neighbours, she spent three years being pummelled by abuse.She said: “I was getting it from every side. Those who voted remain told me I was a traitor for wanting Brexit, while those on the other side said I had thrown democracy down the river.”  Nandy, who carries a panic alarm and has panic buttons in her home like many women MPs, said: “The abuse over the last three years has been astronomical some of it misogynistic, some of it deeply sexist, some downright abusive and some threatening. “When I was first selected I had notes through my door and letters to the office, saying ‘you need to get out of this country’ and ‘you need to leave politics’. “Right-wingers were at the centre of it and they tried to slash my car tyres but got my neighbours instead. “Some people wrote on message boards that I was a secret Muslim and planned to tear down the Anvil pub in Wigan and put up a statue of a woman in a burqa. “It gathered some traction because people were emailing askingI was Muslim. I’d write back saying ‘I’m an atheist but I have respect for every religion.’ I think they eventually came a cropper when other people started posting on these messages that I often spent my Fridays nights in the Anvil! She admits being shaken when fellow MP Jo Cox was murdered. “I sat down with my partner and we had a conversation in which we said ‘is it worth it ’, she says. “He feels very strongly that it is because, in the end, do you want to bring your kids up in a world where we allow these people to win ”  She seems mystied as to how anti-semitism sentiment in her own party got out of control. If elected Leader, she will move quickly to stamp it out. She was shadow cabinet for Energy and Climate Change in  when Bradford MP Naz Shah was caught up in a row over anti-Jewish social media posts. Jeremy Corbyn caused tensions by refusing to suspend her straight away.  Nandy said: “I went from pillar to post over a course of  hours trying to get the Party to take it seriously and couldn’t get anywhere with it, despite some people on the inside trying to help me.” AskedCorbyn is to blame for Labour Party issues Nandy refuses to directly criticise the hand that fed her on her rise to possible leadership. She has known Corybn since she was a -year-old researcher for MP Neil Gerrard. She says: “I don’t think the Labour Party is anti-Semitic because most members hate racism as much as poverty. Don’t forget it’s working class people, often Labour Party members, who have driven the far right out of town over and over again over decades. They hate racism and they feel badly let down.” Nandy left her Shadow Cabinet position in  when it became clear to her Labour in-fighting was going to rage on between the Corybnites and their rivals. She says: “I got a very strong steer the factional war was never going to end and they were going to fight it out until one side had won and the other had lost.” While her father, , is a leading academic light, Nandy credits her mum Luise, , for being the most inspirational person in her le. The couple split when Nandy was seven, but the MP hates the term single parent household “because I had two parents, they just happened to live in dferent houses.” One of her earliest memories involves politics when she went out canvassing and delivering leaflets with her mum, who stood as a local councillor.

He did not describe how tall she was, how short, fat, thin, her mental condition, her clothing and he missed a lot of the injuries that were present on the body.  The girl had a lot of bruises which are shown in the photos which were taken by the police at the time of the examination. And he didnapost photograph the front and the back of the body, the torso.

Because the couple’s first wedding took place in  and ended in a painful orce back in . And for nearly  years the pair, who had three children together, never spoke. They even stood at opposite sides of the football pitch whenever they watched youngest son Adam play. They also managed to get through two of their boys’ weddings without saying a word to each other. But it was tragedy that brought them back together, with Jan consoling Rob over the loss of his second we.  It made the pair, now , realise le was too short for their rt to go on – and that the love sparked when they met at a Woolworths store as teenagers was still burning. Rob says: “Jan was my first love and we will be growing old together as I definitely can’t afford another wedding – or a orce.” And Jan, who had the ceremony she dreamed of second time around in , says: “We married in a registry office first time. This time I wore a big white dress and we got married in a church. “Our children,  grandchildren and one great-grandchild were with us. It was perfect and I’m back with my best friend.” The lovebirds first met in  in the days of flares and s at a Woollies store in Erdington, Birmingham. Jan worked in the office and Rob in the stockroom. Within a year they were dating. Jan recalls: “Rob and I were just . I was a cashier and he was pretty much my bodyguard, going round the tills with me collecting money twice a day. “He asked me out at a works Christmas dance.

But  years into their marriage, cracks started to show. Jan was made redundant from her job in Boots and started working shts at another company. She and Rob barely saw each other. She says: “I absolutely loved working at Boots and I think I had a bit of a breakdown after being made redundant. “Rob was always saying he didn’t see enough of me in my new job. I was working until  at night. We started arguing about that a lot and I just got fed up. I left and we didn’t speak properly again for years.” The couple separated in  and Rob filed for a orce, which came through in . Both met new partners and Rob remarried two-and-a-half years after their split. Rob says: “I never thought I’d find love again, but I did. My second we was an absolutely wonderful woman.” Although Rob and Jan’s paths crossed occasionally, they didn’t speak for years.  Jan says: “Adam played football and we’d both go and watch him, standing at opposite sides of the pitch. It was strange. We even made it through two of our sons’ weddings without talking. “Lee was married first. Rob and I were both with dferent people and just sat in dferent places. “When our son Adam had a wedding reception, again we didn’t talk to each other.“The only time we ever did wasafter we lost a grandchild. I was in hospital, crying.“Rob put his arm around me and said, ‘It’ll be OK, sweetheart’. I don’t know why we never talked.” That all changed in  when their daughter Cara told her mum that Rob’s we had died of oian cancer. The tragedy broke the ice.  “I gave him a call and offered my condolences and said I was there for himhe needed me,” says Jan. “A couple of weeks later, he gave me a call and we chatted for  minutes and arranged to see each other for a coffee. “I found it was like being back with my best friend. It was so bizarre – we picked up where we had left off  years earlier.” Rob says: “It was wonderful. We just started to get along like we always had done.” The couple decided to start seeing each other again – but kept it from their children until Jan ended the relationship she was in.

Party goers complained of vomiting and diarrhea, as well as painful stomach cramps, with some claiming they were sent home from work. Charlotte Bareham was one of those who fell aposviolentlyapos ill after attending and said she aposcouldnapost keep anything downapos. She suffered sickness and diarrhea on Thursday and noticed others on social media complaining about similar symptoms. Dan Perrin, events director at the club, says the illness is a mystery since the venue doesnapost serve beer on tap nor food.Since the outcry on Twitter from punters and parents concerned over their youngsteraposs illness, Mr Perrin has confirmed the venue is investigating complaints fully.He said: Feedback from our customers is our number one priority so of course this is something we take very seriously and will look into fully over the coming week. We will say however that Sugar Hut club does not serve food, bar snacks or draft beers wines etc. It is therefore quite dficult to find any common denominator at Sugar Hut at the present time but we will be speaking to those who have messaged and emailed us to try and investigate further. He also noted that the illness could have come from some other source as we all live in the same area.Charlotte, who had waited for hours in a queue before getting into the club, told The Sun : I woke up Thursday morning feeling very unwell. I was violently sick and throughout the day I couldn’t keep anything down.I had sickness and diarrhoea which I thought might have been food poisoning or a stomach bug and then someone I know sent me a screenshot of tweets they’d seen about people falling ill after attempting the New Year’s Eve event at Sugar Hut.  The cause of the sickness remains unknown, but both those who drank at the venue and those who didnapost have claimed to have fallen ill. Some say they still feel sick and have had today off work too. Niamh Mullane, from Gidea Park, attended the party with her boyfriend and a number of close friends. The -year-old said: I was drinking vodka and lemonade. I was fine until yesterday midday when I started being sick and so has my boyfriend and three of my close friends. I still feel very sick today and have taken the day off. It seemed normal, but since Iaposve been ill I have spoken to people and itaposs all of my friends, plus my tweet had about  likes of people feeling the same way of being sick.

The majority of people I spoke to were drinking but there are one or two who werenapost and they are still being sick. We arrived at .pm and didn’t get in until pm due to the queue to get in. I left at am as it was so packed and hot. Lisa Michaels, from Grays, claims that her son, Charlie, is currently in bed after falling ill.

Word of the latest closures was spread by members of the public who posted photos of store closure signs in shop windows on social media. However, in many cases HMV has not made any public announcements. The outlets affected are in Leeds, Reading, Plymouth, the Bullring in Birmingham, Worcester, Bury St Edmunds, Grimsby and Nuneaton. The future of the following stores is currently unknown as HMV seeks to strike a deal with landlords: Bristol Cribbs, Edinburgh Ocean Terminal, Glasgow Braehead, Merryhill and Sheffield Meadowhall. If unsuccessful, they could shut.Reading’s HMV store in The Oracle launched a closing down sale on January , and closing down posters were put up in the mall. However, it is unclear whether the store is closing down for good or whether it’s relocating. Plymouth’s Drake Circus HMV is making way for a fresh retailer, leaving the centre on January  and re-opening in the former Maplin store in nearby Cornwall Street, also in the heart of the city centre.  One disappointed shopper wrote on Twitter : “My heart dropped when I saw the Closing sign, then realised they’re just moving, sad to see the store go by glad Plymouth will still have a HMV! #hmv” . Have you seen an HMV close down near you  Email webnews@mirror In Grimsby, the Freshney Place branch announced it will shut its doors later this month with for sale signs on almost all of its products and ‘store closing’ signs in its windows. However, HMV says it’s in talks with Freshney Place regarding the closures, and will inform customers “ anything changes”. A HMV spokesperson said: “At this time, talks are ongoing with the landlords involved and are currently progressing in a positive direction. “Thank you to the community for their ongoing support for us and we will let you knowanything changes.” Meanwhile, HMV in Worcester’s Crowngate Shopping Centre will close its doors on January  after the new business owner said the store was ‘no longer viable’.  A spokesman from HMV said: “Regretfully we can confirm that HMV Worcester will be closing, despite our desire to continue trading in this location.” HMV Nuneaton in the Ropewalk Shopping Centre will also close at the end of January after it was unable to agree a new deal with the landlord. Meanwhile, in Bury St Edmunds’ Arc Shopping Centre, the music will close its doors on January , and is rumoured to be making way for sports retailer JD Sports. HMV’s Birmingham store in the Bullring shopping centre is due to pull down its shutters at the end of January. Staff were told the opening of an HMV in the entertainment store at the fringe of the city centre, called HMV Vault, would eventually lead to the Bullring closure as its overheads are much higher. At the moment there isn’t a signicant sale at the store, though some prices have been discounted but many vinyl products have not.

She told her son he needed to come home and be under the care of family doctors and Wirral. The -year-old added: I kept blubbing and thinking the NHS will save him and thinking we will do this, we will get him help, look at me Iaposve had [depression] for nearly  years and Iaposm fine. He was just really despondent and hollow, its hard to describe until you look into their eyes. Obviously I had looked into Matthewaposs eyes for nearly  years and he always had a future, a plan, uni and loved his le and wanted to study in America. Mental health services in Wirral were contacted by the familyaposs GP, however at this point Vicky claims they were reassured the teenager didnapost have a mental health illness despite Matthew having auditory hallucinations and having made a suicide attempt, as well as self-harming. Matthew went back to Leicester where he had regular visits from doctors and counsellors, reassuring his mum he understood the gravity of his suicide attempt. Vicky said: I was a constant bag of nerves. I was having about three hours of sleep a night, I was permanently waiting for the phone to go, but I told myself Iaposve got to learn to calm down. Matthewaposs second suicide attempt - a message from his uni mates and a suicide letter left behind On Halloween , Vicky received a message from one of her sonaposs university friends saying Matthew had attempted suicide for the second time. Vicky said he pre-planned and researched his second attempt, leaving him in a secure unit in hospital. The mum-of-three also found a suicide letter. Vicky and her husband told Matthew he needed to quit university andhome to the Wirral for good. She said: We decided he had to come home and I need to be able to monitor him and go to meetings with him and he knew he needed too as well, he said aposyes I know I need to get better.apos Upon theirhome, Vicky said she phoned their GP again and made an emergency appointment with mental health services right away. The mum claims her son had an hour long appointment at Clatterbridge Hospital.  She added: I remember it being an hour as because I took a really heavy book thinking Iaposd be there for ages and looking at my watch. He came out and he was given no medication, they said he had no mental health illness and there didnapost really seem to be anything much. They said right you need to make these plans, things to look forward to. As December  rolled around, Vicky claims her son was insistent on helping his dad out at his grandmotheraposs house, only later to find out Matthew had hidden items there. The -year-old said Matthew walked the dog with her to work and they had arrangements where she would call her son to check in. She said: We had these little arrangements and I was only up the road and he seemed to be starting to look like he wanted to make plans for the future. We were still very cautious of him though and we thought mental health services were aware of him and he was seeing people. I know people are going to say - why didnapost you put him private care and I beat myself up everyday that we didnapost re-mortgage our house and that I didnapost force my way into the room into one of those meetings. Matthewaposs third suicide attempt - a worrying Facebook post and a call to police In December  Matthew  posted a cryptic message on Facebook, which a friend in Leicester spotted and managed to ring Merseyside Police before it was deleted. Matthew had made his third suicide attempt. His mum said: I was in work and my neighbours came up and said aposwe donapost want you to get too distressedapos and the minute they said that my stomach just dropped. Police had broken the door down and my boss drove me to our house. Itaposs like I revert to being a small child and perhaps a lot parents who lose children do this, you revert to wanting to be  years old again and want to run away to the park because youaposre so scared. Matthew wasnapost in his family home, but Vicky noticed the keys to her mother-in-laws house were missing. A nearby traffic officer drove to the house where he noticed blood. Matthew was found next to the fire in his grandmotheraposs house, sat on the sofa and waiting to die. Vicky said: I remember thinking now I really am scared and I donapost think anyone can save him now and then I started losing a little faith. I donapost think they understood the urgency - it was his third attempt. The -year-old claims her son was left in AE with no security in place and was left with a kne and fork. Vicky said: They had left him with the curtains that go round the bed and thick bedsheets at the end of the bed and I was sitting opposite him and I saw him look at those sheets and look at the curtain rail for a long time.  I thought I know what he is going to dohe is allowed to, he is going to do something. We had quite big discussions about it, which is pretty dark - having a conversation about your child trying to kill themself. Itaposs not a conversation you should have but then it should be at the same time. He was always very honest and open. The zone you go into he described it as a tunnel when the pain got too much and itaposs like a fog which takes over and you just do it. If it clears a little it and the pain lessens a little bit and people start talking to you, you push it away. He told me because I wanted to know, he said it was like having loads of Matthews and him - the Matthew who wants to get well canapost get out. Where is this place you think we can keep him safe  Vicky claims that a member of the mental health team arrived and said they would assess him in the morning. His shoes had been removed and the family were told security would bring him backhe tried to leave the hospital - but there were no constant checks. The next day, Vicky brought a four-page suicide note Matthew had written in to his assessment. Vicky claims she and her husband were initially denied access to the meeting but were eventually allowed to be present after insisting they should be there. The family told mental health services they couldnapost look after Matthew on their own and he needed professional help, but claim they were asked aposwhere is this place you think we can keep him safe apos Matthewaposs parents suggested the psychiatric unit at Clatterbridge Hospital, but said they were told once again he was not mentally ill and had to take him home. Mental health services agreed to contact the home team for Matthew to receive visits. Vicky claims when the home team visited they promised they could give medication and section Matthewneeded. A -hour helpline was  also provided and the family started to feel they were being taken seriously. However, she claims the home team only visited three times before Matthew was discharged without telling his parents - with his third appointment allegedly lasting five minutes. Vicky also claims Matthew was not given any medication, a diagnosis or the chance to see a psychiatrist, but was given five sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy . It was recommended that Matthew visit the gym and consider ing to university. She said: I would take him to the gym and outside because I was petried he was going to leave and go somewhere. We would talk a lot about his illness together, he said he had constant pain in his head and had no zest for le. At the end of February , Vicky managed to get Matthew to see the familyaposs GP, as she believed her son was planning another suicide attempt. Their doctor urgently requested for Matthew to see a psychiatrist, writing in a letter aposI can no longer guarantee his safety.apos Vicky claims the request was rejected, but Matthew had one final appointment at Clatterbridge for  minutes. The mum alleges she was once again told her son did not have a mental health illness because Matthew told them he wasnapost going to end his le. Itaposs awful to see police tape over your childaposs bedroom door After three suicide attempts in just a few months, Matthew took his own le on April ,  - his fourth known attempt. Vicky said: He killed himself on April ,  and itaposs awful to see police tape over your childaposs bedroom door. He died on his own in his bedroom - that breaks my heart.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA single mum who went on a drunken rampage on a British Airways jumbo jet has admitted attacking cabin crew staff. Emma Langford, , has admitted attacking BA staff on the flight to Cape Town in South Africa, punching the manager and kicking another in the back of the legs while screaming: “You have a massive ar*e.” She faces jail and must wear an anti-booze bracelet after her case was adjourned so the court could seek evidence she is seeking treatment for her alcoholism. During the incident, the mum-of-two had pulled out trays of stowed plates and glasses, causing them to shatter on the floor and cutting another member of staff before pummeling cabin crew. She eventually had to be restrained with the help of an off-duty police officer on the flight before being carried off the plane when it touched down in Cape Town. Langford had previously pleaded guilty to charges of three assaults, criminal damage, being drunk on an aircraft, and behaving in a threatening manner towards cabin crew. She faces up to two years imprisonment. Isleworth Crown Court heard how Langford, as part of matters relating to the custody of her two young sons, is now accompanied by a woman who observes her  hours a day and lives in her Old Baising, Hampshire home to ensure she does not drink alcohol. The -year-old is also to wear a SCRAM bracelet, a device that is able to detect alcohol in the system every half an hour.  Both the prosecutor and defence sought to adjourn the matter for a pre-sentence report to be completed and for the court to receive a letter from her psychiatrist. Prosecutor Douglas Adams said: “Ms Langford was on a British Airways flight to Cape Town, South Africa, when she assaulted three members of the cabin crew, broke crockery and glassware, and behaved in a threatening way to several members of the cabin crew. “She was flying to South Africa to attend a rehabilitation centre to seek treatment for her addiction. “She has two recent convictions for drinking and driving.” Guy Wyatt, defending Langford, said: “It’s a mystery why no one prior to this hearing made a pre-sentence report.  “There are mental health dficulties and a serious history of alcohol abuse at play here. “It’s my application for a full pre-sentence report to be completed. I acknowledge the case law is severe. It makes it clear that it’s a rare thing for anything other than a custodial sentence. “An immediate custodial sentence is the starting point. “This lady had a plan to go to an alcohol rehabilitation centre. It’s not been a story of success, unfortunately. “In the next few days, she’s going to be fitted with a SCRAM bracelet. It may be in the interest of the criminal courts to order this be observed.  “The bracelet has a sensor that reads alcohol in the sweat and makes a report every  minutes. “It arose from family proceedings of custody of her two children. She has two young sons. “The court will be assisted to see the observations of this bracelet, consulting reports of her psychiatrist and evidence from her sober companion. “She lives at her home, and is with her  hours a day. “If anyone can come back from this, it’s this lady.”  At Langford’s previous hearing at Ealing Magistrates Court on December , her actions were deemed “so serious” that she must be sentenced at a crown court. Recorder Joseph Boothby said: “It seems to me that you have a background and history the court will want to know before I consider the extreme measure of sentencing you to prison.

This meant the mum-of-two was left in hell as she was only able to afford a property in terrible condition. Lauren found a house in the worst state ever but was determined to give it a makeover in time for her and her two sons to enjoy at Christmas.She revealed the incredible transformation in Facebook group DIY on a Budget where members show the fruits of their labour while spending as little cash as possible.

Britain’s most elite forces have been mobilised in the wake of President Trump’s ­ordering the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani, . He died in a Reaper drone missile strike near Baghdad airport in ­neighbouring Iraq on Friday. It is understood around  members of the Special Air Service and the Navy’s Special Boat Service along with the Special Forces Support Group will be sent to Iraq to help any possible ­evacuation of Britons in the region. There are at least , military and UK government civilian personnel in Iraq as part of Operation Shader which is the UK mission to help train Iraqi and Kurdish forces defeat Islamic State. Boris Johnson is expected toto London from ­holiday in time for ministerial meetings in No on Monday amid fears of all-out war breaking out in the Gulf.It is understood defence chiefs have ordered British troops in Iraq – numbering around  – to be on high alert following the assassination. Senior commanders are concerned that British nationals could be targeted by Iranian-backed Shia militia groups based inside Iraq. Soleimani was the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force and mastermind of Iran’s Middle East operations. He has been blamed for the deaths and maiming of thousands of British and American troops in operations across the Middle East over decades. One senior UK defence source said: “Soleimani was an enemy combatant in  a war zone who was deploying to oversee and orchestrate Iranian ­operations in a foreign country which would have resulted in the deaths of US soldiers, ­civilians and potentially British personnel as well.  “He knew the risks and took his chances as all troops do and he paid the price.  “Soleimani had been a marked man for quite a while. He had the blood of many British soldiers on his hands. “The attack was all about sending a message to the Iranian leadership and that is that the US can get at you at any time and in any place.” Last night several rockets landed near the US embassy in Baghdad, injuring five people. Three more rockets were reportedly fired at Balad Airbase housing American troops north of Baghdad. In another development Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced British warships would resume ­operations in the Strait of Hormuz. HMS Montrose and HMS Defender are already in the Gulf and will act as escorts to British tankers to prevent them being seized by Iran’s navy. Mr Wallace said: “The Government will take all necessary steps to protect our ships and citizens at this time.” At least  targets in the US and Israel have been identied by Iran for retaliatory strikes after the country’s president vowed to exact revenge for the killing of General Soleimani. Targets include ships in the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and Tel Aviv. The US State Department said: “General Soleimani was actively developing plans to ­attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.”  Thousands of mourners chanted “Death to America” yesterday as they marched in Soleimani’s funeral procession in Baghdad as US and UK flags were publicly burned. It is feared that all-out war could break out in the regionIran calls on its allies Russia and China to help as tensions rise. The Foreign Office yesterday strengthened its warnings over travel to the Middle East. British nationals were advised not to travel to Iraq or Iran. The Foreign Office warned that anyone in Iraq outside the Kurdistan region should consider leaving by ­commercial means because the ­uncertain security situation could ­deteriorate quickly. Alerts regarding other Middle East nations were also being increased, with warnings that Britons should remain vigilant in Afghanistan, Israel, Lebanon and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab , who will visit the US next week to meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a previously planned visit, said: “The first job of any Government is to keep British people safe.” An American official denied the nation was behind a second air strike on two vehicles north of Baghdad. Iraq’s state TV reported that the attack killed six people in a medical convoy.US president Donald Trump said his order to kill Soleimani was “to stop a war, not to start one”.Back in  Soleimani was involved in backing pro-Iranian militia groups in southern Iraq. These factions targeted British troops with bombs and rockets, killing and maiming a signicant number. In response the SAS set up a special operation to wipe out the Iranian-backed cells. But a mission to kill Soleimani was reportedly blocked by David Miliband, then Foreign Secretary. A British military source said: “The Foreign Secretary said that he wanted to talk to the Iranians, not kill them. “We had Soleimani in our ­crosshairs, but we had to call the operation off because of sensitivities in London about conducting this type of operation.” There has been criticism of the US for not giving advanced notice of the attack to the UK. Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the failure to noty was regrettable because allies should ensure there are no surprises in the relationship.Mr Hunt said: “This is a very, very risky situation, and I think the job that we have to do as one of the US’s closest allies is to use our influence.” Friday’s attack also killed four Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards and five of Iraq’s pro-Iran paramilitaries.

However, Aberdeen have the right people in charge and are built to deliver success.“The facilities at Cormack Park are great, but ultimately it is the people that matter.“I am a great believer in people. Aberdeen have the right people with Derek McInnes, Tony Dochertyand Gordon Marshall .“They have a really good first team squad and then there is Neil Simpson .”The Bosman ruling was passed by the European Court of Justice in  and ruled that clubs no longer had to pay transfer fees after the expiration of a player’s contract.The rule was the result of Belgian midfielder Jean-Marc Bosman’s fight against his then-employer RFC Liege.Before the Bosman ruling, a player could not leave at the end of their deal unless that club agreed to let him go on a free, or that club received an agreed fee from a buying club. The Bosman ruling allowed a player to leave a club on a free transfer as soon as their contract expired.That flipped the balance of power as players now had leverage to demand signing-on fees and salaries from new clubs to make up for absent transfer fee.Players coming to the end of their contract could also ask for more money from their current club, who would fear losing that player on a free.Aberdeen are in the driving seat with Cosgrove and McKenna as both are secured on long-term contracts.Middlesbrough, Derby County and Stoke City are tracking prolic scorer Cosgrove, who became the first Aberdeen player to net  goals before Christmas since Duncan Shearer in .Cosgrove is contracted until the summer of , having signed an extension last January.QPR are also reportedly set to step up their interest in centre-back McKenna after having a bid rejected towards the English summer transfer deadline.Aberdeen had rejected a £.m bid from Aston Villa for McKenna the previous summer window.McKenna is contracted to Aberdeen until summer .Capped  times for Scotland, McKenna is a product of the Pittodrie youth system and recently made his th appearance for the Reds. Clark is confident Aberdeen’s youth system will continue to produce first-team talent.He believes the £m Cormack Park, which is home to the Bobby Clark Football Academy, will be fundamental to that.He said: “Cormack Park can help bring through young players and it is great that Neil Simpson is now the director of coaching.“When I think back to Simmy, he was the first boy that progressed from the schoolboy coaching into Aberdeen’s ranks.“For him to have made that jump and then to have played as well as he did, to now be running it, is absolutely fantastic.”Signed in , Clark won all three domestic trophies with Aberdeen.Capped  times for Scotland, he was part of the  World Cup squad in Argentina."},{"url":null,"title":"meet rg mowat owner of the fulmar","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAt the end of November we asked readers for help to unravel the mystery of a yacht log book which was posted to the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew. Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in .

to encourage interest in farming, food production and environmental issues.\"I really hope to be able to offer kits to all nurseries and primary schools in Scottish Borders next year.Sponsorship for the eco-friendly dust workshops came from Hamlyns Oats, Booker Cash  Carry and Tesco, Galashiels.The reindeer dust contains porridge oats, Timothy chaff , popcorn and several other secret ingredients.Lesley added: \"The projectrsquos aim was to teach pupils how farmers grow food for us and other animals, how food grown locally is better for you and the planet and how eating the right food can make you strong and healthy.\"Each pack of food contains three pieces of popcorn, as popcorn is the fuel that makes reindeer fly, although too much and the reindeer might never land

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow  Kirkhope Primary Schools, said: ldquoWe were really excited to be one of the first schools to take part in the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos Eagle Schools initiative.\"It really brought our community together and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.\"The children have had the most amazing experience.\"We are incredibly proud of the interest our pupils have shown in protecting this majestic and important bird. We look forward to supporting the project to make sure that Golden Eagles flourish in the south of Scotland.Project partners include RSPB Scotland, Scottish Land  Estates, Scottish Forestry, Scottish Natural Heritage, and the Southern Uplands Partnership.Funded by The National Lottery Heritage Fund, project partners, Scottish Power Renewables, the Scottish Government and local LEADER Programmes, the initiative is a key project under the Scottish Governmentrsquos  Challenge for Scottish Bioersity."},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-sevens-bosses-make-u-turn-road-closure","story":"BOSSES at Melrose Rugby have made a U-turn on their plans to close off St Marys Road during next years sevens.As previously reported, the stretch was due to be shut for two weeks ndash to allow for a temporary stand to be erected.But following discussions with the towns community council, chiefs running the four-day tournament have changed their minds.Now St Marys road will only be partially closed on game days, with a traffic light system in place.Philip Morris, sevens tournament director at Melrose Rugby, said: ldquoAn event like this one will of course come with an element of disruption to the usual routine.\"The Melrose community has embraced the sevens every year, however, concerns around an expanded event are of course completely understandable.\"For the avoidance of doubt, wersquore working really hard to support local businesses as suppliers to the event.\"And wersquoll also be consulting with local residents to address any specic concerns they have too.\"We are confident the economic boost to Melrose and the surrounding Borders towns during the expanded sevens event will be huge.\"News of the U-turn has been welcomed by members of Melrose Community Council.Chairman William Windram said: \"I still think the plans are a bit fluid at the moment, and I think there is still a lot of work going on behind the scenes.\"There are, however, still some issues like late night noise that have not been considered yet, but we have asked them [the club] to come back to our meeting in February to give us an update.\"Some amelioration has certainly taken place and we should be pleased.\"One of the concerns raised by Melrose Community Council at its November meeting was the impact the tournament would have on churchgoers ndash with the event taking place over the Easter weekend.In response, Mr Morris said: \"We are working hard to ensure the important Easter Sunday church service is not impacted and people will be able to get to and from the church without signicant disruption.\"Now the traffic situation on St Marys Road is becoming clearer, we have a plan that we feel will satisfy our local residents.

Her wee brother Pavel was having lots of fun. She waved at him and he waved back, throwing a snowball at the window, then rejoining his friends.Marcela ed to her book. She loved reading, it was her escape into other worlds. She could not enjoy the snow like her wee brother, for she had been in a wheelchair for all her le and the chair would stick in the snow.It was possible to go outside with help, especially when her father was home, butshe tried it herself the front wheels would stick in the snow and ice.It was humiliating so she preferred to stay inside with her books and imagination.

As he unwrapped it his eyes gleamed with excitement.ldquoYes! he called out, hugging his mother and father. It was a huge bottle of ketchup, the real stuff! That may not sound such a present, but it was not easy to get this kind of ketchup in the village and he had always had to use it sparingly. Now he had this bottle all to himself.Then Marcela open her unusual present. She smiled as she held two unusual looking carved short planks of wood, unsure initially what they were. Then she smiled.ldquoAw perfect, bookends for my shelf.ldquoThere are not bookends, said her father.

He connected them to the front wheels of the chair.ldquoThey are wheelchair skis, he said, ldquoI made them. Marcela was overwhelmed.Within ten minutes, Marcela was wrapped up and ready to go out. She nervously wheeled her chair onto the snow covered front path. Usually the wheels would stick within seconds, but this time her chair slid effortlessly along the path.Soon she had got the hang of manoeuvring the chair in the snow. She had snow ball fight and was able to spin around and chase her schoolmates while storing lots of ammunition on her lap.Then she decided she wanted to sledge down the hill. With some help from her brother she got to the top of the hill and peered down the slope. Her classmates had gathered round her wonderingshersquod really do it. She edged forward and then reached the point of no . The wheelchair slid down the slope, faster and faster. Marcela raised her hands like wings crying out ldquowheeee look at me.Then the chair slowed as it approached the bottom on the hill and wobbled to and fro. A bank of snow toppled the chair throwing Marcela out and she fell face first into the snow, arms outstretched.Her brother ran to her and helped her back into the chair. Marcelarsquos face was red with the cold and her eyes tearful. They were tears of joy and laughter.ldquoLook, she said pointing to her shape in the snow ldquoIrsquove made a snow angel!All that Christmas day, Marcela played in the snow with her brother and classmates, even making new friends.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

This is the first step towards bringing agricultural beasts back and using them to improve the conditions of the productive land on the island.As well as paving the way towards the reintroduction of farming activities, the cows presence is hoped to help boost bioersity and help support corncrakes and rare species such as the Slender Scotch Burnett Moth.Subtle signs of activity on Ulva come  months after the island celebrated a controversial pound. million community ownership deal largely funded by public money.Some argued it was a harsh day for the islandrsquos owner, Jamie Howard. Recently widowed and whose family had owned Ulva for three generations, his hope to sell to his preferred bidder was removed from his hands by Scottish Government community land reform rules.Others, however, embraced the move as a new dawn for an island which had suffered at the hands of th and th-century owners.In , the population of Ulva and neighbouring Gometra ndash attached by a narrow bridge ndash stood at . Within seven years it would slump to a mere  and by the s, Ulva, a favourite spot for Beatrix Potter, Sir Walter Scott and visited by James Boswell and Dr. Samuel Johnson, would have just seven families left, with crofts abandoned and properties in ruins.Since the change of ownership, however, interest has soared among people keen to visit and, perhaps surprisingly for a remote spot with no car ferry, school, shop or roads, to set up home.Recently a survey by the North West Mull Community Woodland Company Ltd, which as a result of last yearrsquos community buyout owns Ulva, revealed its population could balloon by , per centall applications to become its newest residents were accepted.More than  people have lodged their interest in living on the island: a challenge, given there are currently just a handful of residential properties and no infrastructure other than a single restaurant ndash The Boathouse ndash to support them.There are, however, big plans. And the arrival of the Highland cattle, says Ms Reid, are just the start.By next summer, the six residential properties are expected to have been fully refurbished. The plan includes the restoration of a Thomas Telford-designed manse, built in the s and long abandoned, and there have been hints that its neighbouring church could one day become a music venue.Further ahead, there has been talk of a proper campsite, mini-hotel and hostel for tourists who want to extend their visit, an oyster farm and shops. Itrsquos been suggested that within a decade, Ulva could be home to at least  people, rising to  by .Certainly, there is a major rise in interest: visitor numbers have boomed from around , a year to over , over the course of the past year, raising questions over the tiny islandrsquos ability to cope with the additional footfall.ldquoThere has been a signicant increase in the numbers of people coming across to visit, says Ms Reid. ldquoIt will lead to pressure on infrastructure on the island, but we are working on a number of things to manage it and to give visitors a more erse experienceldquoWe are very aware of the impact of more visitors and we dont want the island to be overwhelmed.Those who made the short journey from Mull during recent weeks may have noticed subtle changes. For a start, volunteers have tackled the overgrown walled garden at Ulva House which, until the buyout, was the fine B-listed mansion home to the Howard family.Plans for the house are said to include refurbishing half to become a high-quality self-catering property which would fund the running of an interpretation and educational centre in the other half.Further plans are understood to focus on the development of infrastructure to support house plots for sale and self-build and for the construction of rented accommodation.If the cattlersquos recent arrival signies a giant leap towards theof an agricultural sector on the island, there is another sign of a new era.Sheila MacFadyen was a dairy maid for the Clark family, Ulvarsquos owners until the mid-th century.

Usually, each side plays two games over the weekendoften against the same team resulting in signicant travel, not only for the players but the fans that opt to follow them.The Glasgow Clan fans, known as the Purple Army, have attracted much attention in recent years due to their loyal fanbase and large travelling numbers. Their supporters made headlines across the world last year after showing solidarity with LGBT people with a message that ice hockey is a sport that welcomes everyone. Their lsquoHockey is For Everyonersquo display at the National Playoffs in Nottingham attracted global attention and received much praise from media and fans across the world.:First-time fan writes about experience of hockey at Glasgow ClanWhile ice hockey may not be the biggest sport in the UK, it does have a passionate and loyal fanbase, and certainly, the Glasgow Clan are no dferent. Their Official Supporters Clubattracts hundreds of members each season who pride themselves on their ability to follow their club wherever they go. And it was this dedication and reputation that led to me arriving just before  am outside of Braehead to embark on an away day with the Purple Army.The round trip to Belfast would see these fans onthe road for around  hours, and I sought to find out what motivates Clan fans to spend hours travelling to watch their side play ice hockey and why such a niche sport has picked up such a loyal fanbase.I arrived for the bus departing Braehead with films downloaded on my phone and comforts that would let me pass the journey sprawled out across the bus, however, I was astounded to find three coaches awaiting over  members of the Clan fanbase who had opted to travel. It immediately became clear why the OSC was the envy of many teams in the league and why such a model was being looked at by other clubs. I soon found myself in the awkward position of having to ask an OSC organiser what bus I was on, having initially assumed there would only be one.En route to #Belfast with the @ClanOSC for a fan piece for @heraldscotland  @Glasgow_Times. Trying to give hockey a little bit more coverage and focus on the fans and spirit around the game.you youre at the game and see me come say hi! #purplearmyFollowing a rather uneventful bus journey, which saw most trying to get some sleep down to Cairnryan, we boarded the ferry for the crossing with pockets of supporters spreading themselves out across the bar and restaurant areas of the vessel. However, I was also surprised to see head coach Zach Fitzgerald and the Clan players descend from their coach and sit next to the fans. All were more than happy to talk and mix with supporters. I couldnrsquot help but wonderthis was part of the appeal of following the Clan, with the players and supporters having such a transparent and civil relationship. Having recently attended the Scotland v Russia match, I couldnrsquot imagine a situation that would allow me to take the same coach as Andy Robertson to Hampden, yet here, I sat inches from the heroes of the Purple Army asit was just a normal morning.Certainly, it was this family-friendly appeal that hooked so many fans into travelling when I got chatting to members of the OSC. Eddie Squires, , said that the ldquofamily atmosphere and supporting his local team was one of the main draws for his love of hockey. He said that ldquohockey was one big family and that through following the Clan home and away he had made friends across the country, even swapping hockey pucks with another fan in Coventry he kept in contact with.An away day with the Glasgow Clan, Picturel Stephen Mcilkenny Eddie was joined at his table with friends John Logan,  and Rab Kennedy,  who had also taken to following the Clan. John had only recently started his Clan journey having previously lived in Canada and followed the sport, whereas Rab had been watching the Clan for a number of years.However, it was the two other guests at the table that surprised me the most in US tourists Sean Kevin,  and son Mike Kevin, . Both were ing to Belfast having spent the last four days in Scotland and following the arrival of  people in Clan shirts, had asked the trio about their side. This sparked a conversation about hockey with Sean and Mike committing to come to the game in Belfast. Sean, originally from Wisconsin said that the passion from the fans was instantly obvious and that the supporters had been open in welcoming them along as soon as they told of their interest in hockey. He said: ldquoEveryone we talk to with the Clan, theyrsquore passionate. Being sports fans from the US, you can tell when someone is passionate about their team, and that came out right away.ldquoThey looked at us and said, lsquoyoursquore American you should come to the gamersquo. Instantly, as soon as they found someone who would have any interest, come on letsrsquo go together, lets cheer for the ClanrsquoThe home of the Belfast Giants. Picture Stephen Mcilkenny Susie Brown, , who has been following the Clan for six seasons after watching ice hockey after taking her brother, was once again making the long journey to Belfast to watch her team. When asked what motivated her to go to such s to see her side, she said: ldquoItrsquos the fan atmosphere more than anything, particularly in seasons like this where we have played Belfast a couple of times and have been absolutely tanked.ldquoItrsquos the interaction with other fans, itrsquos the friends you make through hockey that makes it worth it.ldquoObviously the on-ice product is great, therersquos nothing better than going to an away game and beating them, but we tend to take a rather noisy fanbase, and when we beat them on their own ice, itrsquos great.:Glasgow Clans Zack Fitzgerald: Refereeing can be inconsistentAnd the noise and atmosphere of the fans have not gone unnoticed by the players, coaches and those running the club. Chief Operating Officer of the Glasgow Clan, Gareth Chalmers said: ldquoHistorically our Christmas road game in Belfast has always been one of the best supported away games for the club and OSC. It was fantastic to see so many Clan fans once again make the trip to Belfast and especially the  coaches via the OSC.## THANK YOU ##: To all of the #PurpleArmy that travelled to Belfast on Friday ## #rsquos with the @ClanOSC ### @jardinecaj #Glasgow | #EIHL | #BELvGLA pic YlhAvXgXpldquoTravelling support is absolutely essential for the guys on the ice, it can make a huge dference on the ice hearing you have a large backing in a dficult building.ldquoAlso, away fans are absolutely pivotal to every club in the league, it ultimately adds to a game atmosphere and experience which everyone is striving to improve all the time.ldquoIrsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the OSC for all their hard work organising fantastic travel and the Purple Army for continuing to follow us up and down the UK.A huge thank you to the security staff of the @SSEBelfastArena at tonightrsquos @ClanIHC and @BelfastGiants game, who sought out our Chairman to compliment our passionate, loud, well behaved fans. Even when we lose, we are #purpleandproud #purplearmy #clanontour pic qgbPVCqAKMIt became clear that as well as a number of season ticket holders attending the match in Belfast, there were also those who had opted to come for their first-ever away game, with -year-old Robbie Young among those. I managed to catch up with another lsquofirstrsquo-time away fanrsquo at the , seater Belfast Odyssey SSE Arena, Steven Magee, , who was attending the game in Belfast after  years of home support. Having initially watched the Ayr Scottish Eagles in the s, he said that following the Clan was now a family event with the friendly atmosphere at games one of the major reasons he felt so many ed. He also highlighted the lack of animosity between supporters helping create an atmosphere that was open to all. He said: ldquoMy we is a Rangers supporter, and I am a Celtic supporter, so we canrsquot go to football together, this is a family event and we can go out on a Saturday night and have a beer as well.The SSE Arena.

Almost  hours since leaving Braehead, we ed at am. As the fans shuffled off, some with travel pillows and blankets in hand fresh from their sleep, I asked a fanhe would have done it again knowing the outcome and the time on the road, to which he replied: ldquoYes, yoursquove always got to support your team, donrsquot you Hockey is continuing to grow in popularity in the UK, with the success of the UK national side, some TV coverageand the expansion of the EIHL helping to put the sport in the limelight. With such a friendly atmosphere amongst fans, a relatively affordable price in comparison to other sports, and a growing quality on the ice, it is easy to see why.The growth and the swell in fanbasesshow that ice hockey in the UK is on the right track,and while they say that hockey is for everyone, my trip proves thatit takes a particular dedication to follow the Glasgow Clan."},{"url":null,"title":"veganism-scottish-independence---time-radical-acts","story":"But a bakery has launched a new pastry product and this is making headlines because the pastry product is vegan.

Enough.Another constant refrain of disagreement has been over what to do about the climate crisis. Cue a hundred op-eds split along two themes ndash the inidual must take action or change is the responsibility of government and big business.Earlier this week I read yet another complaint that corporations are let off the hook every time a cold beverage consumer is chided for using a straw.Surely itrsquos plain thatwe are to counter the death of the planet ndash and on what topic could there be a greater urgency to seek agreement ndash everyone must be involved Governments and corporations should be leading the way, they must in order to make the structural and wide-ranging changes needed to halt the damage being caused to the environment. And at the ground level there must be pressure on these organisations.If therersquos no sense of public willing ndash or even public interest ndash then there is no impetus for policy change from the top down.Itrsquos a good broader lesson ndash cross-society cohesion. Compromise to create a larger good.It will be uncomfortable. Creature comforts and conveniences will have to be sacriced cars, plastics, and on. But the compromise is vital.So too is to try, where possible, to stop looking at issues as binary.A hugely problematic and frustrating element of public discourse that has developed is the habit of seeing people as for us or against us. This is common in the Scottish independence debate ndash you are pro-independence or you hate Scotland.In the trans debate too, you are pro-self ID, the new legislation proposed that will allow trans people to more easily and painlessly gain a Gender Recognition Certicate, or you hate trans people.The notion of existence has become a common theme too. Itrsquos not unusual to see, mid-debate, someone claim that the other party would prefer them not to exist. Itrsquos a symptom of a wider trend towards hyperbole in public debate.Anger and frustration grows and grows without any resolution and the means of expressing this fury become so hyperbolic as to be meaningless.As we tread into  these issues are very much at the fore. We will continue to discuss the reforms to the Gender Recognition Act and the interaction between trans rights and womenrsquos rights. The topic of Scottish independence and the chances of another referendum are vivid.Some will say it is impossible to compromise or empathise when there is so much bile spewed in these discussions. On some issues, compromise will be distasteful, rather than merely inconvenient. To reach out an understanding hand to someone you oppose will be no easy feat.Extreme elements of each side must not be an excuse not to try. There are nonsense fringes on every side. More than nonsense ndash toxic, appalling, even violent. These do not represent the vast majority of decent, engaged people.I think thatrsquos something we forget. The majority of people are decent, even when we disagree with them. It should give pause, to think why someone we otherwise respect would hold views in opposition to our own.A decade has just closed in which there has been a rise in xenophobia, a rise in hatred, a rise in exclusion, whether of vulnerable people, those in poverty, or those born where and living here.A new decade has opened and we have to decide how we are going to push back against these rising ills.In a climate of political cruelty and social deprivation, basic moral goodness becomes a radical act. Understanding becomes a radical act. Compromise becomes a radical act. Volunteering and donating become radical acts.In  Scotland will be in a position of confronting its own mythology.

The Scottish Labour movement should support indyref.However he said the Labour movement should also ldquoconfront the question of what independence actually means in a modern geo-political and economic context.ldquoWhile the question on the ballot paper may remain: lsquoShould Scotland be an independent country rsquo, the real question is what powers, or what elements of Scotlandrsquos sovereignty, are Scottish voters willing to share and with whom ldquoThe Labour movement has nothing to fear and much to gain from constructive engagement on this. It needs a compelling offer on the constitutional question, without which it will struggle to get the public to respond to the many positive policies it advocates and constitutional rather than class politics will continue to dominate.Although Ms Sturgeon has called for Indyref in , there appears little prospect of Boris Johnson giving Holyrood the power for it.The SNP MP Kenny MacAskill this week admitted the chance of Indyref in  was probably ldquonil and that was ldquono bad thing, given the SNP had yet to fix problems in its losing independence prospectus of .Mr Smithrsquos call for the Scottish Labour party and trade unions to back Indyref follows two Labour MSPs, Monica Lennon and Neil Findlay, agreeing with Ms Sturgeon that the Scottish people should decide its timing, not Westminster.Also writing in the new Scottish Left Review, Mr Findlay said: ldquoWe cannot deny the people of Scotland a second referendum where the majority is calling for it.

Scotlandrsquos future should be in Scotlandrsquos hands not those of Boris Johnson.ldquoNo politician or political party should stand in the way of people having that right to choose.ldquoThe Scottish Labour movement should take seriously the advice of Scotlandrsquos top trade unionist and engage positively over how we build a fairer, more prosperous country with the powers of independence.Mr Smith is seen as close to the Scottish Government, and has a number of paid positions on public sector boards, as well as being a member of the First Ministerrsquos standing council on Europe.He is on the board of Skills Development Scotland, which pays up pound a year, and the Scottish Qualications Authority, which pays another pound a year.He is also on the Scottish Governmentrsquos Enterprise and Skills Strategic Board, and can claim pound a day for work related to it.SNP ministers also provide almost two-thirds of the STUCrsquos income through its training arm, STUC Training Ltd, far outweighing affiliation fees from trade unionists.The reliance on public money led to criticism from within the union movement that the STUC had lost its way under Mr Smith.However Mr Smith has also criticised the SNP Government in the past, particularly its ldquopathetic excuses for not hiking taxes on the wealthy to pay for public services."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-dare-politicians-tell-us-nice","story":"Itrsquos fondly imagined that we were all tipping our hats as we engaged with each other and offering profuse apologies on those very rare occasions when offence was inadvertently given. Politicians were treated with respect and the use of swear words was to risk being regarded as a sociopath. No matter what issues ided us what chasms of culture, class and wealth lay between us they were all forgotten when we solemnly watched the Queen on Christmas Day. These arrangements had been carefully cultivated over decades to ensure that scant opportunity was permitted for meaningful dialogue between ordinary people and those whom they touchingly believed represented their interests at Parliament.At least you knew back then that there would be an opportunity to change the Government every five years or so. This was on a strictly need-to-know basis and was controlled by the old Etonians and Oxbridge cult who ran the BBC and owned our biggest newspapers.The journalists and editors who operated the print and broadcast media on the other hand were untouchable and never held to account. What passed for scrutiny of their stories and agendasconsisted of a letters page edited by elderly and scholarly chaps nearing retirement. Thus there was room for seven or eight epistolary interventions by the dear readers, usually by those who could express themselves in the manner of a university lecturer and who could pepper their prose with droll classicisms. The people who shaped the political and cultural agenda of the UK media landscape could distort perceptions, wreck lives and destroy careers safe in the knowledge that theyrsquod never be challenged.Occasionally, a political scandal would break beyond the confines of the political and media establishment. For a while, we would all be permitted to catch a glimpse of rich and famous people behaving in the same way as the rest of us. The wonder of these came in discovering that the stratagems of the ruling elites could be blown off course by sex, drink and lies too. All too soon the show was over and an official report would soon exonerate those with the best connections and a scapegoat was offered for public excoriation.The Profumo Affair, currently being re-imagined by the BBC was one of these. The imbroglio had started three years earlier with a brief affair between John Profumo, the Defence Secretary and Christine Keeler, a struggling -year-old model. The episode was one of those which offered us an all-too-rare glimpse of power at the top of British society. While the rest of us were being told to hate the Russians and exercise restraint in our personal lives there was the government and the aristocracy cavorting with the enemy and compromising the virtue of working-class girls in the private swimming pool of the House of Astor.Once calm had been restored and the bed-sheets turned down a compliant judge was found and a whitewash report hastily constructed. The millionaire Sir John Profumo resigned and dedicated himself to charitable work before being redeemed by Margaret Thatcher two decades later. Stephen Ward, the society osteopath discovered that, without aristocratic blood, his connections amounted to little. He killed himself after being trussed up and fed to the country. Christine Keeler, a beautul woman of high intelligence and common birth struggled for the rest of her le.If the scandal had occurred in the age of social media I suspect the losers might have become winners. Ms Keelerrsquos legal fees would have been crowd-funded and Mr Ward would have found widespread sympathy. The independence of the judiciary would have been exposed as a sham and, not for the first time, intimate connections between the British elite and the nationrsquos enemies would have been revealed.As this new decade dawns messages of hope have been laced with appeals for kindness on social media. In particular, an article by the Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser has engendered debate. He has been joined by assorted political pundits who purport to desire a sense of decency in the way we engage with each other on social media. Itrsquos dficult to argue with some of this when you observe politicians being terrorised by psychopathic mobs, often within their own parties, who seek to destroy them for holding reasonable views they canrsquot stand.I also become queasy when fake academic faculties which exist to make failed politicians feel good about themselves urge us all to gentry the political environment. In the UK and across the world a war of ideas is being fought which will affect our lives profoundly. Britain is in the hands of a feckless and self-serving fop backed by a party thatrsquos been taken over by an extremist, right-wing sect. To make his hard Brexit fly he must approach the White Housersquos resident sociopath like a supplicant.A tonne of leverage will be required to sell the outcome but when you control % of the mainstream media and can rely on a BBC still dominated by Eton and Oxford to look the other way you are already halfway there. In the absence of a ing Labour Party social media provides the main source of opposition. This is no time to be worrying too much about it harbouring bad language and anger."},{"url":null,"title":"cate-devine-adult-diners-acting-like-spoilt-children","story":"Recently Irsquove been intrigued to read online comments from Scottish chefs and restaurateurs expressing their frustration at trying to satisfy the increasingly dficult demands of diners. Some of these demands stem from genuine dietary intolerances and allergies, but many appear to be based on nothing more than maddening game-playing.The chef-patron of a Michelin-starred restaurant posted that he spends more time writing menus for dietary requirementsthan for what he called ldquoreal menus. ldquoIntolerances, etc., today include: dairy, shellfish, gluten, vegetarianplus no caviar, lamb, beef, game, processed sugar, orange, grapefruit, squid, melon, cucumber, offal, egg or nuts, he wrote, adding that ldquoitrsquos always interesting to see someone non-dairy end their meal with a latte, because theyrsquove lsquoavoided dairy for most of the dayrsquo.Another post highlighted the frustration of unreasonable demands ndash and ensuing complaints. ldquoDidnrsquot get a window table . Donrsquot have Harveyrsquos Bristol cream, donrsquot do chips or omelette. Wonderthey do Tripadvisor.But intrigue has morphed into deep unease as ldquofaux intolerances and allergies have started to invade and discombobulate the eating-out scene. I was quite heartened when an Edinburgh restaurateur stepped forward to sum up the situation from her industryrsquos point of view: ldquoA lsquoveganrsquo not keen on pasta or gazpacho will have calamari, butternut risotto and chocolate cregraveme brulee. A customer who is allergic to pork products, citrus fruits, unpasteurised dairy, raw rare seafood and meat, lentils and pulses, wants calamari, venison and tarte Tatin. She added: ldquoThis is why every restaurateur in the land is on Valium or has become an alcoholic by December . They [diners] should just write their own menu. She suggested that restaurants should start demanding doctorsrsquo letters to prove that an allergy was real, and cited a prominent chef describing the situation as critical: the ldquofaux dietaries were killing the catering industry and were its biggest challenge.The online response was predictably robust ndash to the extent that she actually left Twitter for a bit to recover from the vitriol, which included being fat-shamed and accused of being in denial about being unhealthy herself. But one comment in particular caught my attention: ldquoSuppliers of anything need to adapt to what people want, not vice versa.And therersquos the rub. Itrsquos all very well to claim this, but the problem is that chefsno longer have any idea of what diners actually want from one minute to the next ndash and neither, it seems, do diners themselves. Coeliac disease and lactose intolerance, say, create real and genuine need for chefs to adapt their menus ndash and is the reason menus prominently display the letters V, GF, and so on. And I know of at least one top seafood chef who happily expanded his menu to welcome vegans, and many other chefs who have re-thought their entire menus to make them plant-heavy and meat-light for the same reason. They tell me they applaud the opportunity to be more creative with new and exciting dishes that can be safely consumed by as many customers as possible. Obviously this makes commercial as well as ideological sense.But recent evidence suggests that demands have gone beyond that to the extent that chefs are now expected to dance to the tune of spur-of-the-moment whims of diners on the night ndash without warning, and thus robbed of the chance to plan and source dishes in advance.Are people out to have a laugh at restaurantsrsquo expense just to big up the number of clicks on their online s  If so, itrsquos a deeply irresponsible practice that puts hard-won culinary reputations, careers and entire businesses at serious risk. Not to mention making a mockery of those with genuine dietary conditions. No wonder some within the industry are fighting back by outing the culprits online. This too is a risky game that restaurants would not willingly choose to play unless compelled to do so, and I applaud them for having the courage to do it.To dismiss the culprits as ldquofussy eaters is to excuse appalling behaviour. Equally, it would be too easy to conclude that such bad manners are down to ignorance of what running a restaurant entails, and that this ignorance has enabled a shocking lack of respect for the industry ndash despite the best efforts of MasterChef and other such television programmes to educate and inform.

Dissing those we should most admire, just because we can, is not a good look for a nation whose culinary reputation is increasingly celebrated across the globe.

The desire for a county, island or regional flag is part of this,\" he said.\"As to why this is taking off now I think it is due to communities seeing the popular success of other such flags. This explains why after Shetland became the first [regional flag in ] the momentum has been building. First with neighbouring Orkney and Caithness, then for communities across Scotland.\"Shetlands was designed in  to commemorate the th anniversary of the transfer of Shetland from Norway to Scotland. The colours were inspired by Scotlands national flag, and the cross shape is from Scandinavian tradition.According to the registry the first town or city flag arrived in Edinburgh. Auld Reekies city flag with its castle and colours of white, black, red dates back to .A competition to design a flag for Skye has attracted  entries, with shortlisting due to take place in January ahead of a public vote. The final design will be revealed in March.Highland councillor John Finlayson from Skye said the attraction of having its own flag, was not just about identity. \"Skye as you know has a unique history, culture and heritage which is becoming increasingly well known because of the huge rise in tourism,\" he said.\"I am often asked by visitors from overseasSkye has a flag and I have often thought that it would be a good idea to have one to further consolidate our identity and our distinctive place in Scottish history as well as our growing popularity as an international tourist destination.\"This is why I have been actively involved in the process to host a competition to create a Skye Flag. I also think it would add to the Skye brand and further develop our sense of identity. \"Ultimate approval of any flag design lies with the Lyon Court, which exists to grand and record arms for those that want them. The Right Honourable the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the head of Lyon Court, is the Scottish official with responsibility for regulating heraldry in the country, issuing new grants of arms, and serving as the judge of the Court of the Lord Lyon, the oldest heraldic court in the world that is still in daily operation.\"The general principle would be that Scots can have arms  banners in principle,\"said Mr Tibbetts. \"This is borne out historically as former Lord Lyon Sir Thomas Innes [who served from  to ] noted, that the general uptake of heraldry in Scotland is historically far higher per capita than in England.\"Orkney became the third Scottish community to have its own flag, receiving official recognition in April, .It was designed by postman Duncan Tullock, who sketched out his initial idea using his young grandchildrens crayons.Mr Tullocks blue, yellow and red design was voted the best of  designs submitted to the islands council.It replaced an older flag, the red and yellow cross of St Magnus which was considered to be too similar to other national banners.It would take another nine years before a fourth Scottish community flag was approved, leading to a new wave of interest in having a recognised emblem.Mr Tibbetts said: \"For a community a flag firstly provides a simple symbol that locals can connect with together. Secondly it can then be used to raise the visibility of that community externally.\"It is also important nationally as this reinforces the Scottish tradition of having a rich array of symbolism across the nation as seen in tartans and heraldry.\"Caithness kickstarted the latest appetite for new Scottish heraldry, unfurling their flag in January, .It features a Nordic cross and galley symbolising Caithness ancient ties to the Vikings.The Caithness flag flies next to the Saltire in Wick MarinaThe design was picked from suggestions sent to Highland Council from all over the world.Six months later there was one in Kirkcudbrightshire and then a flag in Denny and Dunipace in Stirlingshire.The Kirkcudbrightshire flag was organised to mark the Queens th birthday.The green and white quarters reference the checks that appeared on a former local authoritys coat of arms, and also the checked cloth used historically to count taxes by the Stewards of the Lords of Galloway.It also features a St Cuthberts cross to reference the origin of the name Kirkcudbrightshire as the \"shire of the church of Cuthbert\".Denny and Dunipaces town flag is a green, white and blue design showing the River Carron separating Dunipace and its -pointed star to the north and Dennyrsquos two-towered castle symbolising the River of Forts to the south.Raising the South Uist flagIn the Western Isles, South Uists Nordic cross in the pattern of Norways flag secured official recognition for its banner in May, .Donnie Steele, a former councillor, championed South Uists flag, organising a petition to gather support for official recognition.:Barra flag officially recognised six months after terror victimrsquos deathAnd by the end of that year Barras green and white Nordic cross, used by residents of the Hebridean island for decades secured official recognition.In June, that year, the flag was draped over the coffin of Barras Eilidh MacLeod, , who was among the victims of the Manchester Arena attack.Tiree unfurled its new official flag in September, last year. Donald Camerons green and gold \"Land of Barley\" design was chosen after a competition launched earlier that year.\"A competition allows for hundreds of designs to be in with a shout. By engaging with the community, such as with the school talks on Skye, and including information with the competition pack explaining what makes an effective flag then as many people as possible can be given as good a chance as possible at creating eligible designs and ultimately winning the final public vote,\" said Mr Tibbetts.Another public vote led to Sutherland beingamong the latest to get official recognition in December, Source: Philip TibbettsThe winning design featuresa Saltire and a Nordic cross. Three other flags were in contention, including one originally selected by a judging  and drew public criticism for its eagle and stars design.The design represents Sutherlands position as the historic mainland frontier between Scotland the Vikings.East Lothian also had a new flag registered in the same month after another competition.

The Civil Service is an established part of, er, the Establishment, as is the BBC, which is also under attack by the new Tory Government. Like the BBC, itrsquos a British institution once lauded for its professionalism and objectivity but now suspected of being flaky.Free market types resent the jobs for le and cushy pensions. As someone in favour of both, and indeed of most things that are at ldquothe taxpayerrsquos expense, Irsquove defended the Civil Service in the past. But I can do so no longer, partly because I believe the quality of its staff has plummeted and partly because Irsquom currently filling out my tax . In sunnier times, before climate change, entrants to the Civil Service would often be classics graduates ndash my kind of guys that is to say, useless.There were sensible exams to sit and straightforward interviews in which to demonstrate onersquos charm. Then you were in. Today, graduates in gender studies are invited to sit psychometric tests designed by nutters and passed only by people who should be receiving treatment in benign institutions.Thus, todayrsquos Civil Service is full of folk whose main skills are speaking jargon and claiming that theyrsquore Napoleon. Theyrsquore not even Josephines of all trades, as happened in the past. They are simply masters of nothing.It is perhaps, then, no surprise that Downing Street is planning ldquoseismic changes. For example, mandarins will be made to sit periodic exams to ensure that theyrsquore keeping up. Theyrsquoll no longer be moved frequently from department to department either, but will have to become quite good in one particular area.For the awful truth is that our new political masters are insisting on ndash look away nowyoursquore of a sensitive dispostion ndash competence. This is a massive threat to the British way of le.The impetus for this subversion is said to come from Dominic Cummings, the Prime Ministerrsquos senior adviser, who believes a permanent Civil Service is ldquoan idea for the history books, and that it promotes people ldquowho focus on being important, not on getting important things done.Rachel Wolf, co-author of the Toriesrsquo election manesto, wrote in The Dailythis week that the revamped Civil Service will answer to yonder public instead of to ldquostakeholders and will run ldquothe most dynamic state in the world. Whether this includes Scotland is a moot point. Our confused constitutional position is mirrored in the Civil Service here, which is ided into a London-answerable Scotland Office staffed by unionist spies and an Edinburgh-answerable Scottish Government bureaucracy staffed by politically correct, psychometrically tested nutters.Back in Downing Street, meanwhile, Mr Cummings has advertised for ldquoweirdos and ldquomisfits to work for him.

I look to the Faroes a few hundred miles away and see how their population is booming and ours is not. There are vital lessons to be learned there, he said.Scotlandrsquos first National Islands Plan was officially launched last month.Reversing the plunging population levels on the islands will be the key to their long-term survival, according to the blueprint to safeguard their future.Some islanders feel their communities are at risk as youngsters leave to seek opportunities on the mainland, the plan admits.The document has been hailed as a ldquohistoric milestone by the Scottish Government and seeks to address concerns about economic growth, transport and connectivity.There are  inhabited islands off Scotlandrsquos north and west coasts which contribute to the countryrsquos ldquonational identity, according to the blueprint.ldquoOver the last  years, almost twice as many islands have lost populations as have gained, the plan warns.Projections suggest Orkney and Shetland face losing .% of their population by  and the Western Isles %.

I now look forward to working with colleagues and partner organisations to put the plan into action.ldquoThrough the planrsquos development, Scotland is showing our island communities that they are very important to our nation, we care about their futures and that their voices are strong and being heard.The lack of availability of transport services along with the cost of travelling both to the mainland and between islands was a major concern raised by inhabitants. They called for better ferry services and more capacity on services which already operate. The decreasing availability but increasing cost of flights were all flagged up.Heidi Thomas, the creator of CallThe Midwe, hailed the island location for the Christmas special as ldquopossibly the most beautul placeIrsquove ever been.But it is an increasingly barren one as since  the population of Harris has halved to just under ,.Some islands that once had people now have none.Between  and , the Outer Hebrides had a net out-migration of  young people aged -.According to a previous Highlands and Islands Enterprise report, population trendsfor young people in the isles ldquoarequite bleak.Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the future for several Scottish islands may have raised an alarming scenario.People who have lived on a tiny Canadian island for decades have slowly been abandoning their town after the government announced it would be cutting off power and other services for good. Only two people plan to stay living on Little Bay Islands, a town in Newfoundland and Labrador in the countryrsquos far east.The Canadian government had given residents on the small island a December  deadline before they permanently cut off services, including electricity, snow removal and ferries.The government will save roughly  million over the next two decades from the relocation."},{"url":null,"title":"view-islands-precious-part-history-just-scenery-offer","story":"The Scottish Government is researching what needs to be done for island survival.

Following the throw from former Doonie player Barrie Reid at pm, the game travelled as close to the Shorie goal as the back of the Kirkwall iCentre before a break involving Mr Baillie#s son Findley Cooper saw the beginning of a slow journey up Great Western Road toward Lidl supermarket and then onto Junction Road.With both teams seeming to get the upper hand at dferent times, it was hard to tell what the outcome would be. However, on this occasion, the Uppies weren#t to be resisted and they eventually claimed a very hard-fought win.With the Doonies fighting to the last minute, a mighty throw saw the ba#, made by Edgar Gibson, hit Mackinson#s Corner, and within just a few minutes Mr Baillie emerged from the pack as the winner, to cheers and singing from his teammates.Asked to described how he felt about the win, he replied: #I#m absolutely over the moon.

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians. Entirely unsurprising entirely unacceptable.

In many encounters Africans residing in Ireland are often politely teased with the query, can you speak African please  Honestly, we don’t get offended by that question, generally the interlocutor would probably have assumed that “Africa” is a Pan-African language. I wish! The continent has over , languages, dialects and subcultures. Notwithstanding, the four countries listed above are just a small fraction of African nationalities in Belfast. There are many. The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea. West and North Belfast are probably the more African by headcount, followed by South and then East of the city. Some African countries are more visible than others here and we shall come to that in one of my future writings here at Andersonstown News. I just can’t wait. There is so much to explore in the lives of Africans in West and the rest of Belfast when you are inside the broth, it is the freshness you will get in this column moving forward, the smell, beauty and finesse of Africa.

Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"full list of northern ireland new years honours","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its going to be a case of Netflix and chill. I bought all these new clothes before Christmas but they are hanging off me now,\" she laughs. All of Nicoles Christmas presents remain unopened but her family are planning a belated celebration with turkey and all the trimmings this weekend. While she is glad to finally be home, Nicole is also angry that she had to fight for so long to get her treatment. She is also calling for the drug to be made available to all sufferers as soon as possible. \"Im so glad I spoke up about cystic fibrosis as not a lot of people know about it, and proud that I showed people how hard it is, but thankfully Ive come out the other side better. \"But it shouldnt have been that way and I should have had Trikafta sooner.\"While Nicole now has her treatment, she has no idea how long for. \"Its on compassionate grounds and could be forever or just a month or a week,\" she said. \"I have enough medication for another month which feels so surreal but I can tell you this is nothing short of a miracle. However, its up to the drug company whether they want to keep me on it or not. \"They could pull the plug at any moment but I dare not think about it and just have to keep going. \"My aim is not to end up back in hospital for a long time except for check-ups and reviews.\"Nicole is also hugely grateful for all the care and support over recent weeks as she battled to stay alive. She added: \"Ciaran and I come from dferent religious backgrounds but Im so grateful to everyone from both sides of the community for their love, prayers and amazing support. \"Also, all the doctors and nurses who were outstanding and the extra care they give to the very sick people is out of this world.\"Les a gt and you cantit.\" The couple are now looking to  with renewed optimism after the last few weeks and hope Nicole will be well enough to attend a charity football match in aid of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust next month.

Ciaran is also focusing on ato his boxing career, which had been on hold during Nicoles illness. \"I rang my manager about arranging a fight so Ive been given a date in May in Manchester because before then I want to focus on Nicole getting better and off the oxygen for good,\" he added.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Former Chief Constable George Hamilton, who had described the officers as \"brave\", later apologised to the families of the teenagers.March: Soldier F is chargedIn March, a former Paratrooper was told he will face murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in .The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney.William McKinneyThe sole prosecution was seen as a \"terrible disappointment\" by some of the families of the  people killed at a civil rights march on  January, .The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Troubles.Soldier F also faces charges for the attempted murders of Patrick ODonnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn.The Public Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute  other soldiers and two Official IRA men.James Wrays brother Liam said he was \"very saddened for the other families\" of those killed on Bloody Sunday.\"Their hearts must be broken,\" he said.\"It has been a sad day but the Wray family are relieved.\"Linda Nash, whose brother William was shot dead, said she felt \"let down by a law and a justice system thats supposed to protect people\".But the news led to a loyalist campaign of support for Soldier F, with banners erected across Northern Ireland over what some saw as the unfair victimisation of former British soldiers who served here.April: Lyra McKee is shot dead by dissidentsJournalist Lyra McKeewas fatally shot in the head while observing rioting in Londonderrys Creggan estate in April. The New IRA later admitted carrying out the murder.Massive public outcry followed her death, with former prime minister Theresa May, Irish president Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar among those to attend her funeral at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast.Lyra McKeeThere was a standing ovation, and loud applause erupted, at her funeral service when priest Fr Martin Magill openly challenged the politicians in the pews over the ongoing Stormont stalemate. \"Why in Gods name does it take the death of a -year-old woman to get to this point \" he asked.In the days after the murder a protest by friends of Ms McKee took place outside the Londonderry offices of dissident republican political group Saoradh, which has been linked to the New IRA.A number of protesters smeared red handprints on republican slogans outside the office, and they quickly became a symbol for peace across the country.A strong LGBTQ activist, Belfast born Lyra had moved to Derry to be with her partner, Sara Canning, shortly before her death.Her book, Angels with Blue Faces, which deals with the  IRA murder of Belfast MP Robert Bradford, was published several months after her death.June: Boris tackles BrexitAway from the ongoing political turmoil as Stormont remained closed for business, the main topic in the political arena was Brexit.After several failed attempts to get her Brexit deal for the UK to leave the European Union through Parliament, Theresa May announced she would be standing down as Prime Minister on May .Mrs May was finally replaced by Boris Johnston after leaving office on June .After ing to the EU, Mr Johnson came back with a new deal, but several more failed attempts to find a route through parliament finally led to a General Election on December .Boris JohnsonBrexit brought particular concerns for Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK with an EU land border, and debate raged over the frontier. Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

We have no reason to believe she wandered off and is lost.\"Teenager Nora Quoirin went missing on a family holidayIncreasingly desperate after nine days without news, Noras family offered a £, reward, donated by a Belfast businessman, for information, but a day later Noras body was discovered near a waterfall less than two miles from the holiday villa.Malaysian police said they believed she died from internal bleeding probably caused by hunger and stress.Her parents have always maintained a criminal element was involved and have since enlisted the support of the Irish government as they call for Malaysian authorities to carry out an in-depth inquiry.Noras funeral was held at St Brigids Church, Belfast, on September .October: immigrants’ bodies found in lorryIn October, the UK was shocked when  bodies of immigrants were discovered in the back of a lorry.Lorry driver Maurice Mo Robinson from Co Armagh was arrested in the wake of the tragedy.All those who died - eight women and  men - were originally from Vietnam and had been trying to enter the UK illegally in the refrigerated trailer.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The container lorry in which  people were found dead at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex Police said they had received the first reports about bodies found in a lorry in Grays, Essex just before .am on October .Robinsonwas later charged with the manslaughter of the  victims, people trafficking, and immigration and money laundering offences.He pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey on November  to conspiring with others to assist illegal immigration between May ,  and October , .A second man from Northern Ireland was charged with multiple counts of manslaughter.

The biggest loser was the DUP, with Nigel Dodds ousted by Sinn Feins John Finucane after serving as North Belfast MP for  years. The DUP also lost South Belfast where the SDLPs Claire Hanna unseated Emma Little-Pengelly by over , votes. The DUP suffered a third blow in North Down where the Alliance Partys Stephen Farry claimed the seat vacated by independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon.Nigel DoddsWhile the DUP finished the election down from  seats to eight, Sinn Fein saw their majorities slashed across Northern Ireland - Mr Finucanes win tempered by a crushing defeat for Elisha McCallion in Foyle.

And not taken very seriously.”Cox, who is nominated for a Golden Globe this weekend for his role in Succession, said the Labour party had “failed” in Scotland, after it registered just one MP following the last election.The actor left Labour in  to join the SNP.Really, we need to take care of our own destiny, finallyBrian CoxCox said Scotland’s pro-Remain vote in the  Brexit referendum, when the country voted % in favour of staying in the EU, was part of the reason Scots are “organically” moving towards a decision to leave the UK.“Eventually you can push people so far and they’re finally going to say ‘enough is enough,’ he added.“Really, we need to take care of our own destiny, finally.”Askedhe thought Scotland would vote to leavean independence referendum were held tomorrow, he said: “It’s hard to say.”“The Scots are very canny and they keep a lot to their chest,” Cox added.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Hollywood actor Brian Cox has called for a second referendum on Scottish independence “So they’re not necessarily going to give things away.

Chief among them is the blow-out of estimated costs.The network was initially expected to cost £. billion. Latest estimates by HS Ltd – the private company in charge of the project – put the price at £ billion. But Lord Berkeley says independent analysis arrives at a figure of at least £. billion.“I believe that Parliament has been seriously misled by the failure of HS Ltd and by ministers to report objectively and fairly on costs and programme changes,” Lord Berkeley wrote in his report.“Parliament needs one firm figure for the funding envelope at the time when it gives formal approval to cancel or amend a project without wasting large sums of money.”Lord Berkeley said he wrote his “dissenting” or “minority” report because he disagreed with, and was not given the chance to amend, some conclusions of the draft report overseen by Doug Oakervee, the former HS Ltd chairman appointed by Boris Johnson to lead the review into “whether and how we should proceed” with the project.The now defunct review ’s deputy chairman launched a scathing attack on the review in November, after a leaked draft recommended the high-speed railway should be built in full despite soaring costs.In his report, Lord Berkeley says he wrote to Mr Oakervee to detail his concerns with the review. These included “a bias towards accepting HS’s evidence in preference to those of others, leading to what I considered to be a critical but supportive recommendation for HS Ltd to continue. I do not believe that the evidence that the review received supports this view.”Lord Berkeley linked the costs of HS to the fact it was planned around a specication “unnecessarily high and expensive” for a country the size of England, far smaller than other countries with high speed trains.“HS Ltd has designed the scheme for  kph , higher than any other high speed line in Europe or Japan, and for  trains an hour in each direction, when the company itself admits that no other such high-speed line is able to run more than  to ,” he wrote.“Even before taking into account the much higher scheme costs, the ratio of benefits to costs … is totally , based as it is onmore trains than any other high speed line can operate, on higher speeds, and on trains running full all day with high fare paying passengers.”Lord Berkeley said while economic modelling by HS Ltd had arrived at a conclusion that benefits of the project would be more than twice its costs, his best estimate was for a benefits-to-costs ratio of less than one, and possibly as low as ., making it “poor value for money”.He also said plans to build HS – compared to merely improving existing lines – were “not good for the environment”.In addition, HS Ltd had “exacerbated the situation by its appalling treatment of stakeholders, residents, businesses and councils in the areas over which it plans to construct the lines”.“Stakeholders have been poorly served and often misled by the contents of Environmental Statements issued by HS Ltd.”Lord Berkeley concluded HS was “the wrong and expensive solution” to providing better North-South intercity services.“There is strong evidence that the greatest need and demand for improved rail services is within the regions, in particular the Northern Power House and Midlands Connect areas,” he wrote.Lord Berkeley said information disclosed to the review  raised “very serious concerns about the competence of HM Treasury and the Department for Transport” in relation to the project, and that of HS Ltd.“All this does not give me confidence either that HS Ltd. has the necessary corporate ability to take the project forward, or that the Department for Transport has the correct policies and structures to manage such projects on behalf of the whole government and reporting to Parliament,” he wrote.Lord Berkeley’s report sparked a strong reaction from anti-HS champaigners.“The case for HS has always been poor, and is simply getting worse,” said Penny Gaines, chairman of Stop HS. “It is time for this white elephant of a project to be cancelled as quickly as possible.”The executive director of Greenpeace UK, John Sauven, said the Government needed to start listening to “HS’s critics”they were serious about climate change.“The protection of ancient woodlands must be a priority for rail development,” he said.Phase one of HS is planned to run between London and Birmingham. It was initially planned to launch in , but a recent report by HS Ltd stated that this could be pushed back until .An HS Ltd spokesman said: “There have been many inidual views expressed about the HS project, however we await the publication of the Government’s official review.”A Department for Transport spokesman said: “The Government commissioned the Oakervee review to provide advice on how and whether to proceed with HS, with an independent  representing a range of viewpoints … Lord Berkeley’s report represents his personal view.”"},{"url":null,"title":"puppy given emergency treatment after chocolate biscuit binge","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it took hold the blaze was so intense that it gutted the home in a matter of minutes. The terrible incident followed on from Laura’s recent battle with breast cancer and the bad news was compounded further when the Housing Executive informed the family that no emergency accommodation was available in the area.But after an online fundraising campaign almost pound, was gathered in a bid to help the beleaguered family.Laura Ferris’ sister Maolisea McKee told the Derry Post: “We are just gobsmacked at people’s generosity.

MLA hits out as health service crisis worsensNovember started with the Derry Post reporting that rural areas in the county are the worst affected areas by the ongoing crisis in the health service.Patients awaiting surgery, cancer treatment and domiciliary care packages are facing long and excruciating delays for access to services that an MLA for the area says required immediate government intervention.SDLP Assembly member Patsy McGlone revealed that his constituency office was inundated with concerns over the level of care being offered. He said issues that were being consistently raised included the availability of ambulances and a dearth of staff working in health clinics and hospitals.“Traditionally, at this time of year the demand on health services starts to build, but what is dferent this time is that we have seen an increase in the number of constituents who are coming to us over hospital admissions.“People waiting for surgery, for a consultant appointment- I even had someone with me recently waiting on cancer treatment.“There is no doubt about it, the health system is under pressure, both locally and further afield. It is a resource issue- we need more staff, more consultants, more doctors and more nurses. Those working in our health care system are left coping with the huge demand and are feeling the pressure. We need to invest in staff and we need to do it now,” he said. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last year the Christmas Tree Recycling Scheme raised around pound, and it is hoped that with the support of locals a similar total,not more, can be gathered this time round.Foyle Hospice will accept a suggested donation of pound and once collected the trees will be shredded for use in its Culmore Road gardens. Money raised will be directed towards the palliative care of patients with cancer and other le-limiting illnesses such as Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Parkinsons Disease and COPD.The scheme provides a simple, environmentally friendly and the most charitable way to dispose of your Christmas tree.A Hospice spokesperson said: “We all “joyfully choose our Christmas tree and transport it home ready to dress for the festive period.“However, after “th night” when its needles are dropping the thought of taking it to the household recycling centre or chopping it up to fit into your bin is less appealing.“So, Foyle Hospice and our wonderful team of volunteers will collect your tree on Monday th to Wednesday th January  for a small donation.“We are delighted this year to have received sponsorship for this initiative from Seagate Ltd, who are also providing volunteers to help with the mammoth task of the collection of the trees.“Once collected. We work with our own volunteers and our corporate partners at Elagh Tree Surgery, who give up their time to chip and shred trees and these chips, are recycled for use within the Hospice grounds.”You can book your collection today by registering on the following link: https:register.primoevents ps event ChristmasTreeRecyclingSchemeIf you have any questions please e-mail: fundraising @foylehospice or telephone   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His kicking against Bellaghy was pin-point and ied. In their win over Swatragh he made two fantastic saves and Magherafelt would have been out of sight only for his brilliance. [nd All-Star]  - Conor McCluskeyWhile also a very capable baller, Clucker was Adrian Cushs go-to marker in defence.He was asked to shackle Colm McGoldrick when Darren ONeill was black-carded. He kept a lid on Peter Hagan in the semi-final while getting forward to add to their attacking arsenal. Jack Doherty and Ryan Johnston also struggled against him. Two messy Benny Heron goals, neither of them his fault, was the only blot on a perfect season.

Two moments of bravery to win turnovers that resulted in Rossa scores.[nd All-Star]  - Gavin ONeillCharlie OKane kept Bellaghy guessing with Gavin ONeills jersey number positioning and in his new wing back role, he was immense. The fact that he nicked man of the match ahead of Conor Feeney and Tiarnan Moore spoke wonders of his performance.Swatragh didnt learn the lesson and once again ONeill bossed the game from wing-back, edging the battle with Patrick Kearney.[nd All-Star]  - Connor CarvilleWhen Glen licked their wounds after their hammering in the league by Slaughtneil, it was Connor Carville that learned the most. Following Sammy Bradley left Glen open.In the championship he was a dferent animal and when Oisin Hegarty was dismissed against Loup he was one of Glens leaders.Against Magherafelt he was one of the few to offer any help to goalkeeper Callum Mullan-Young. Glen didnt have enough like him. [st All-Star]   - Conor KearnsWith Michael McEvoy going under the kne, Magherafelts system of play needed someone to link their defence to attack. Kearns fitted the bill and thrived in his new found freedom. He handled an endless supply of ball against Coleraine and didnt look back. His goal proved to be the vital score to sink Banagher. He didnt deserve his season to end prematurely with a harsh black card against Kilcoo. [st All-Star] - SENIOR PLAYER OF THE YEAR  - Danny HeavronThe Rossa skipper once again poured out everything he had for the cause.His influence helped them see off Coleraine and his moment of quick-thinking put Kearns through for the all-important goal against Banagher. In the final he pressed high on Glens kick-outs to turn the game. Against Kilcoo he once again linked the play and was missed during a brief spell at full-forward. [st All-Star]  - Ciaran McFaulAfter Loups goal it was McFauls point that made Glen believe again. When they were staring into a defeat against Lavey, he led the way again and his display of fielding was simply awesome. Against Slaughtneil he plucked another one from the air, just when Glen needed a moment of inspiration.Not as influential in the final as was required.

[st All-Star]  - Alex DohertyAnother contender for player of the championship, he pinged - from play and was Glens top scorer.His goal against Lavey was sensational. After beating three men on his road to goal, he powered to the net for the goal that arguably changed Glens season. Scoring - off Karl McKaigue is no mean feat and he backed it up with four mighty points in the final. [st All-Star]  - Tiarnan MooreOne year on from tearing intermediate defences apart, Moore was at it again. His tally of -, with one assist from brother Niall, tore the Bellaghy defence asunder as he revelled in the open spaces.While he didnt score against Swatragh he pulled their defence all over the place as Banagher once again made hay.His frightening pace was one of the stories of the championship.

[st All-Star]  - Alex DohertyAnother contender for player of the championship, he pinged - from play and was Glens top scorer.His goal against Lavey was sensational. After beating three men on his road to goal, he powered to the net for the goal that arguably changed Glens season. Scoring - off Karl McKaigue is no mean feat and he backed it up with four mighty points in the final. [st All-Star]  - Tiarnan MooreOne year on from tearing intermediate defences apart, Moore was at it again. His tally of -, with one assist from brother Niall, tore the Bellaghy defence asunder as he revelled in the open spaces.While he didnt score against Swatragh he pulled their defence all over the place as Banagher once again made hay.His frightening pace was one of the stories of the championship.

Meanwhile, EU leaders drown migrants in the Mediterranean, provide arms and political cover for dictatorships infor contracts with European companies, collude in Zionist assaults on Palestinian rights, etc.But everywhere, too, there is revolt. Chile, Hong Kong, France, Catalonia, Iraq, Sudan, etc, have all seen millions in the streets against the rule of the rich over the poor. In Lebanon, a by-word for communal hostility, Sunni, Shia, Christians and Druze have come together in angry array against the elites.Young people in unprecedented numbers have swamped cities demanding radical action to save the planet.Long struggle has finally won abortion rights for Irish women, North and South, and equal marriage in the North.There’s evidence everywhere that the isions which keep the working class enchained can begin to melt in the heat of struggle.In Ireland, the battle lines are drawn between those who want unity of the oppressed in pursuit of a better world and defenders of the riven status quo.The battle is unequal. The forces of the Right seem in the ascendant. But  has also shown the depth of resilience and the fighting capacity of plain people. The magnitude of the masses shouting out across continents has had the character of a global uprising.It is in this that socialists find hope for the future, across all Ireland as throughout the world.Orange and Green politics are useless when it comes to defending the NHS, resisting job losses, opposing welfare “reform,” fighting for civil rights for all, etc.What’s needed is to drive forward and expand the emerging struggle all around us. The same perspective lights the way to Irish unity.Homeless deaths on the streets, hospital patients stacked in corridors, teachers run ragged in over-crowded class-rooms, workers denied union rights, State corruption, a suicide epidemic - all these apply in equal measure North and South. It is by bringing these struggles together that we can transcend the borders within and between us.We in People Before Profit put all our trust in the indomitability of the working class of the world.Pessimism is a weapon to be used against us. We don’t believe we won’t win. Here and everywhere, the vanquished of today will be the victors of tomorrow.These are the perspectives which guide us in our work in trades unions, civil rights campaigns, the environmental movement, and in all .We urge all who sympathise with this approach to join us in struggle in the year to come. googletag.cmd.push Eamonn McCann googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He believes the EU budget will be “signicantly reduced” following the UK’s departure, which, coupled with the possible admission of other countries into the EU, will have a detrimental impact on the Republic of Ireland moving forward.The recent Westminster election results can be interpreted as giving voice to the exasperated desire of many people to see a Stormont Government up and running to try and deal with the extreme circumstances that abound in health, education and other sectors in our society. Another element has been seized upon by some in declaring that for the first time there are more Nationalist MPs than Unionist MPs elected. This disguises the more fundamental point that while some Irish republicans go into a frenzy about demographic change bringing with it the so - called inevitability of a united Ireland, they have avoided actual election results which show nothing like that outcome. In this year’s election there were first time voters who had not been born when I was first elected to Parliament in . In that Westminster election  years ago, the united Ireland parties, Sinn Fein and SDLP, obtained .% of the vote, while at last month’s Westminster election Sinn Fein, SDLP and Aontuacute got .%. Support for those parties that advocate a united Ireland is less now than it was when I was elected in . The much vaunted “demographic change” that republicans repeat ad nauseum has worsened their chances not improved them. The other more practical problem they face is that just as any pan unionist vision of an ultimate solution such as total integration within the UK wouldnt have been possible or practical whatever the majority voting for it may have been, just so any pan nationalist vision of an ultimate solution of a United Ireland would fail by the same criteria. The other big ticket item next year will be the Brexit proposition. Again, those who advocate staying in the EU through an impossible united Ireland have not been open about what lies aheadthey were to be successful. The EU budget will be signicantly reduced on an annual basis by the UKs net contributions of approximately poundbillion. Countries such as Serbia and Montenegro potentially joining in the next five or six years means the budget would become even more hard pressed let alone any fancul notion that an Independent Scotland would be re admitted pressurising those net contributing countries, such as the Irish Republic, for more money again. In short, staying in the EU in those circumstances would cost the Irish Republic much more than it is costing them now, anyone looking to join them should ponder that.  is the year we must press the new PM to give us a more equal United Kingdom as opposed to an even more expensive EU. googletag.cmd.push Gregory Campbell googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But, is the colder weather having an impact on your sleep  Are you struggling to drt off or waking up feeling chilly  If so, don’t fear. Holly Housby, sleep expert from Sealy UK, is here to help with her top tips for sleeping when it’s cold. Take a bathNot just relaxing, having a bath before bed can actually help to promote sleep and induce tiredness. Your temperature naturally dips at night as your body prepares for rest, beginning about two hours before sleep. When you soak in a hot bath, your temperature rises by a degree or two, and the rapid cool-down immediately after the bath imitates this natural decrease of your body temperature, which can help you to fall asleep faster. googletag.cmd.push Wear woolly socks, not cottonOften, poor circulation means that our feet are the first part of our body to get cold. Wearing woollen socks can help to keep you warm throughout the night - unlike cotton, wool is an great insulator and retains heat. And even better, wool has anti-bacterial properties meaning your cosy socks are odour resistant. Get movingExercising in the late-afternoon and early-evening can help to boost your body’s circulation and body temperature. However, it’s important to steer clear of exercise in the hour before bed, so as to avoid this having an impact on your sleep. googletag.cmd.push Say no to a night-capNot only does alcohol limit the amount of time you spend in REM sleep, the most restorative stage of sleep, it’s been suggested that alcohol can actually contribute to a lower body temperature. This is because alcohol causes your blood vessels to dilate, which takes blood and heat away from the core of your body. If you still want to enjoy a nightcap in the evening, make sure you only have one, and have it as early in the evening as possible to minimise its effects at bedtime. Upgrade your TOGIt goes without saying that investing in a thick, cosy duvet is important to staying warm during the winter nights. As a rule of thumb, a winter duvet should have a tog rating of . – . However, it’s also worth considering the filling.Wool-filled duvets can be quite chunky, making a good choice the cold nights. However, there are also synthetic duvets which are manufactured from fibres that are designed keep you warm while you sleep, which can be a great choice for those looking for hypo-allergenic options.

Waterworth promptly stepped up and fired Linfield into the lead.That lead was doubled within minutes as Stute caved in completely. Brogans initial effort was tipped over by Brown, but from the corner, Waterworth flicked on and Haughey turned the bal home from close range to make it -. It should have been - by the half time break, but again Brown came to the rescue, denying Cooper who should ahve scored, but regardless, Linfield were comfortable at the break, whilst Stute had a huge mountain to climb. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The chances just kept coming for Linfield as Lavery broke clear on goal but with just Brown to beat he shot wide. Stute then had the woodwork to thank for keeping the score down as Millars delivery was met by Haughey but his weffort bounced back off the post into Browns arms.There was little sign of any come back from Stute and the chances con tinued to come for the home side who were proving wasteful in front of goal, as Waterworth went one on one with Brown only for the Stute goalkeeper to come out on top again. The third goal eventually did come and the superb Cooper created it as he raced away from his marker before cutting the ball back to substitute Jordan Stewart, whose close range strike was outstandingly kept out by Brown, but Lavery was on hand to turn home the loose ball in from close range. Institute take a break from league action when they host Dungannon Swts at the Brandywell in the Irish Cup this weekend. The teams palayed out an entertaining - draw when Swts lasted visited Stute last month.

Waterworth promptly stepped up and fired Linfield into the lead.That lead was doubled within minutes as Stute caved in completely. Brogans initial effort was tipped over by Brown, but from the corner, Waterworth flicked on and Haughey turned the bal home from close range to make it -. It should have been - by the half time break, but again Brown came to the rescue, denying Cooper who should ahve scored, but regardless, Linfield were comfortable at the break, whilst Stute had a huge mountain to climb. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The chances just kept coming for Linfield as Lavery broke clear on goal but with just Brown to beat he shot wide. Stute then had the woodwork to thank for keeping the score down as Millars delivery was met by Haughey but his weffort bounced back off the post into Browns arms.There was little sign of any come back from Stute and the chances con tinued to come for the home side who were proving wasteful in front of goal, as Waterworth went one on one with Brown only for the Stute goalkeeper to come out on top again. The third goal eventually did come and the superb Cooper created it as he raced away from his marker before cutting the ball back to substitute Jordan Stewart, whose close range strike was outstandingly kept out by Brown, but Lavery was on hand to turn home the loose ball in from close range. Institute take a break from league action when they host Dungannon Swts at the Brandywell in the Irish Cup this weekend. The teams palayed out an entertaining - draw when Swts lasted visited Stute last month.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race. Special mention to the Power family who once again dressed to impress and the three sheep bleated their way around the course under the ever-watchful eye of Bo Peep, the Newry AC crew who were came as the cast of lsquoIrsquom a Celebrityrsquo, but regrettably failed to get out of there and had to complete all nine miles and the Grant family and their friends who looked lsquoCrackingrsquo for the Cracker.Costumes came in all shapes and sizes with superheroes galore and even the odd beach ball shoved up a T-shirt for maximum effect.Before we draw the curtain on this event there are some necessary closing remarks.Firstly, we have to mention some of those who were lsquopale facedrsquo as they crossed the finish line.Among this number were Connaire McVeigh, his brother Brian McVeigh, Noel lsquoWonderwallrsquo Gallagher , Dee Murrayand Patrick Higgins who it would seem invented a new shade of grey.While all of these are notable and honourable mentions, there can only be on winner of such a prestigious accolade.The worthy recipient is none other than Dominic lsquoMad Dogrsquo McGreevy, who by his own admission was lsquoclean burstedrsquo by evergreen Jim Brown before they even left the show field.Whilst cogitating the next day with McVeigh, he noted that there was a distinct lack of climbing in the opening mile which considerably reduced his chances of the overall win.Of course, all of this is pure conjecture, passed on to me by others who were better placed to judge. As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place. Course designer McCrickard would like to thank his incredible team that spent the best park of two days marking ndash Francie McAlinden, Audey McVeigh , Aidan Brownand Donal Ward.Thanks also to the entry management and registration team who did so much work in creating and continually updating and modying the team ndash no small task, the marshals from our own club and neighbouring clubs, the lead cyclists from Shimna Wheelers and Kilmegan CC, the motorbike riders, Robert and Paddy, the finish team and the presentation party ndash too many to name inidually, but you all know who you are.In conclusion, the feedback from the , that completed the course was amazingly positive and a great time was had by all.

Health unions agreed a .% three-year pay rise for NHS staff, excluding doctors, in  but the deal did not apply to Northern Northern because of the absence of devolved government.Nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals were among an estimated , from the Royal College who went on strike for the first time in the unionrsquos -year history the week before Christmas.The one-day stoppage marked a serious escalation after weeks of industrial action by other healthcareworkers. RCN nurses were joined by their Unison colleagues on the picket line in poor weather, buffeted by wind and rain.Northern Ireland has the worst hospital waiting lists in the UK, according to figures from the Department of Health with some , people waiting for appointments.

However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit. And yet within ten years he finds himself stranded once again, this time in the Sudan.Here, however, he is able to make do by earning money and pursuing some schooling and eventually being presented with a graduation certicate. Because of the particular school he attended, he was also able to become a confirmed Christian. However, he discovers, through his interaction with others, that his Christianity is only lukewarm.Through many strange encounters he eventually learns how to accept Christ into his very heart of hearts.As a result of this, he preaches the good news of salvation and in Northern Sudan he is even beaten and imprisoned.As time goes by he meets his we, Gillian, at a theological college in England. Today, David lives in Belfast and is only a lay preacher, but also someone who teaches others how to explore and discover the meaning of their lives and with others, how to realise their potential.Out of Africa is available on loan from Downpatrick Library and can also be bought from amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Seals.jpg","title":"Seals prosper in Strangford Lough  ","story":"STRANGFORD Lough is proving to be a popular nursery for grey seals.The largest sea inlet in Ireland can boast having  pups born in its waters during last autumn, the most since records began almost  years ago.The National Trust, which records the number of wildle visiting the area, revealed there were  adults in the lough at the peak of the breeding season last year ndash something of a turnaround for the protected species.In the early s records show that only around six or seven grey seals were born in the area each year.Lead ranger at Strangford Lough Hugh Thurgate say several factors have contributed to the growth in numbers.He said: ldquoThe boom reflects the burgeoning population in Scottish waters which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea and seals are being forced to seek out new places to breed.ldquoThe shelter of Strangford is a strong draw for seals on the look-out for alternative spots to relax on shore during the breeding and moulting seasons.Mr Thurgate agrees that Strangford Lough is just the place for them.He added: ldquoThe seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young ndash somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance ndash which Strangford Lough offers.ldquoPups are quite vulnerable.

However, since then it has expanded and swallowed up its few remaining rivals to achieve almost complete dominance of the poultry processing sector in Northern Ireland.The RHI scandal revealed how some in Stormont wanted to facilitate Moy Park’s expansion by using the overly-generous payments in the Renewable Heat Incentive, something which became a de facto backdoor subsidy to the company which is now ultimately owned by Brazilian multinational JBS.The company’s complex pricing structure meant that it was very hard for those without insider knowledge of the poultry sector to understand the scale of RHI’s benefit to Moy Park, with it appearing that poultry farmers were making a fortune from the scheme rather than most of that money ultimately benefiting the company..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Among files declassied at the Public Record Office in Belfast are a series of documents which have particular resonance, given what was to follow.In September ,GLT McWhinney, head of Rural Development Division in the Department of Agriculture, sent a restricted memo to Rural Area Co-ordinators.The civil servant told them that Moy Park director Eric Reid had phoned him with a suggestion of locating a processing plant in a disadvantaged rural area.He said that the company was in the final stages of consideration of a new plant to bulk produce chicken fillets for a major international outlet.He said that it would involve  jobs and involve a cost of about £ million. The memo said: “Moy Park are looking primarily at N Ireland sites but are not restricted to locating here.”He then outlined the company’s proposal: “Can Rural Development help  Moy Park are aware of the potential within the programme to put up shell buildings through local regeneration groups which the private sector can rent and fit out.“This releases more capital for the private company and gives the ‘community’ landlord a rental income stream plus local jobs and all partners can benefit.”However, Mr McWhinney noted that working with a company as big as Moy Park “does however raise points of scale and principle”.He identied that EU State Aid law was a key question, asking: “Could a community groupengage with a major poultry company in this way to attract jobs and investment to a disadvantaged area which would not otherwise be considered a suitable location  The project per se would not increase poultry production.”Council to give £m to republican museum with Narrow Water rle Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He also asked whether the department could “engage with a specic company in this way”. And, asking a question which does not appear to even have been asked by civil servants or politicians during the engagement with Moy Park over RHI, he said: “What about other poultry firms ”He also questioned the £ million cost of the building “and that Moy Park is really not interested in anything smaller”.He said that the cost per job “appears to be reasonable and the risk element relatively low”.The following month, fellow official Liam McKibben said in a restricted memo that EU State Aid rules permitted grant assistance for poultry processing facilities but not for slaughtering or production of chickens.He said that it would be “prudent” to take the view of Whitehall’s agriculture department and the European Commission before committing to paying a grant.He said that “almost certainlywe are to go down the road you outlined this will create a precedent for other approaches both from the poultry sub-sector and the food processing sector in general”.He added: “The availability of such funds could be used to underpin direct and indirect Government support for the industry.”The files show that at the same time, Moy Park was in discussions with ROSAabout a processing factory in Jonesborough while also in talks with the IDB about locating the plant at Granville in Dungannon — essentially getting two arms of government to compete over how much subsidy it would receive.A document said that in a conversation with Janett Liggett from the Department of Agriculture, Mr C Jordan from Moy Park “admitted that in local public relations Moy Park does not enjoy a good reputation and companies like Tesco would be keen for their supplier to take a more pro-active role in the community”.At the time, the company had told government that it “wishes to expand on-farm poultry production” and that it had “developed a sophisticated contractual arrangement with producing farmers”.try catch  TrendingYoung man found collapsed in NI woodland on January  has been identied say PSNI -

Red meat also attracted a huge amount of unfair and unsubstantiated criticism from a range of ill-informed commentators and self interest groups..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “Despite this backdrop, the UK red meat industry and its levy bodies made good progress in  in telling the true and positive story about our livestock and meat industry’s sustainability, contribution to climate change mitigation and its ability to help feed a growing global population’s demand for dietary protein.”“Looking to the main areas in the world where demand is growing it is encouraging that Chinese and UK authorities agreed a protocol in  for UK beef exports to China and our industry looks forward to servicing this important market in  and beyond.“As an organisation which provides services to beef and sheep farmers and processors LMC is acutely aware of the importance of the beef and lamb industry to the Northern Ireland economy, rural society and the countryside which we all enjoy.”The Commission’s chief executive confirmed that  is a milestone year when big decisions will be taken by UK Government around the future relationship of the UK with the EU, future UK trade policy with countries outside the EU and the future shape and funding of domestic agriculture policy in the UK. He continued: “Ideally we will have local Executive Ministers from Northern Ireland who can play an active role in influencing those policies and reflecting the economic and societal interests of Northern Ireland to Westminster decision makers.”Concluding, Mr Stevenson said: “LMC will continue to educate our young people in Northern Ireland schools on the importance of including beef and lamb in the diet. We will also promote the quality, versatility and values of Northern Ireland farm quality assured beef and lamb at home and abroad. “All stakeholders with an interest in the UK agri-food industry must work more collaboratively and strategically than perhaps they have ever done in the pastthe post-Brexit era is to be one that works successfully for our industry and delivers positive outcomes for society.”Meanwhile Farmers for Actionhas welcomed the new year with calls for Stormont to get back up and running. Such a development, it is believed, will make it easier to secure the introduction of guaranteed farmgate prices in Northern Ireland. These would cover the cost of production incurred by farmers but would also include an additional margin, which would put production agriculture on a more sustainable footing. According to FFA, these prices would be reviewed on a quarterly basis.The organisation is also calling for a halt to beef imports from countries like Brazil. This assertion is based on the claim that the UK and the rest of Europe are self sufficient in beef while beef produced in countries like Brazil has an excessive Carbon Footprint.Council to give £m to republican museum with Narrow Water rle Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Turning to Brexit, FFA officebearers believe that the creation of a trade border down the Irish Sea would be ‘obstructive’ and represents a ‘political failure’ on the part of the UK government.An FFA spokesperson said: “It is certain to give those exporting and importing goods to and from GB and the EU additional transport and custom clearance expense.”try catch  TrendingYoung man found collapsed in NI woodland on January  has been identied say PSNI -

It only became compulsory for front seat passengers in the early s, and in rear seat passengers around the time I began to drive.Rapidly the UK moved from a culture in which most people in cars were not restrained into one in which almost everyone wore a belt..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Deaths and injuries were reduced radically.The other huge change that I notice since then is adherence to  mph speed limits.I remember well the casual way in which these limits were ignored, albeit with occasional moments when police patrols would be found at the edge of such a  mph zone.Drivers routinely sailed into a  mph zone travelling at mph or even  mph.I recall the sense of bewilderment that the wide Newtownards Road outside Stormont had such a limit, when a  mph or  mph limit seemed more appropriate.Now, like most other drivers, I am well used to travelling at exactly  mph along that stretch and it seems a reasonable speed.In the late s and the s, around  people died each year on average on Northern Ireland’s roads. Traffic levels have risen by a multiple of more than . since then, which means that such a fatality rate applied to current traffic levels would result in perhaps  deaths in Northern Ireland each year.Last year there were  deaths, the joint second safest year since records began in .The average number of deaths over the last decade has averaged only .A spate of tragic deaths in recent days shows that, as the authorities keep telling us, one death is one too many.But we should not make that point so forcefully that we lose sight of the stunning — simply stunning — progress that there has been in making our roads far safer.Ben Lowry: A conversation about Northern Ireland with Professor Brendan O’Leary Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"At least  people are alive each year who would otherwise be deadwe had not made such strides in safety.As well as greater adherence to speed limits and seat belt laws, there are many other reasons for the decline,Motorists are better trained, better aware of the risksand better aware of the penalties for drinking or killing someone.Cars are much better built and have to be maintained to a safer standard . Roads are better designed and have better markings.Even so, I can think of several measures that could help to drive deaths down closer towards zero.• Dashboard cameras within cars. They are already used to keep down insurance premiums of young folk, butthat was expanded, fewer and fewer people would dare to drive badly.• A  mph speed limit in streets with housing. The  mph limit is too high on such residential roads. Some years ago I was discussing this with an old school friend and we both agreed that  was too high for streets with lots of parked cars. We were travelling at well below  and put our theory to the test and began to increase our speed up towards the  limit and then stopped before reaching it, because it was obviously too fast with cars on either side. Yet lots of drivers still tear down such roads at that speed or higher.• Greater use of average speed cameras in  mph zones. Elderly relatives of mine live within such a zone and I often see cars seeming to roar past but in fact they might only be doing  or  mph. It is still too fast and so the limit needs greater enforcement.• A mph limit in rural roads. The current speed limit on single carriageway roads, denoted by the national speed limit sign in the picture on this page, is mph. This is far too high for most rural lanes and even for most B roads. • A mph limit on major single carriageway roads or a mph limit on the best of them, but onlythey have a  sign or  sign, to show that they are exempted from the lower  mph national speed limit. Also, far greater construction of overtaking lanes on major single carriageways so that motorists do not get struck behind tractors and tempted to overtake against oncoming traffic• A mph limit on dual carriageways that have deadly gap junctions in the central reservation, enforced by average speed cameras. The current A road in Co Down would have such a  limit until it is upgraded and the gap junctions removed .• A mph limt on dual carriageways that have flyover junctions . This would be enforced by average speed cameras.• An mph limit on motorways. This would be to let motorists know that it is not all puritanism, and that drivers would be allowed to go a good pace on our safest roads. It too would be enforced by average speed cameras so that  means , not . It would further be enforced by cameras to ensure motorists keep their distance between vehicles in front, and do not sit in the overtaking lane.• No new planning permission whatsoever granted for entries directly on A roads. And any existing entrances on to A roads that can be moved to adjoining lanes would be transferred to the quieter, safer road.Under my plan there would, in summary, be a lot more average speed cameras, which would become cheaper with technology advancements. Average speed cameras remove even the temptation to speed, because they cannot be evaded by suddenly slowing down for a fixed site camera, then speeding up again. But under the plan there would also be many more roads with mph limits , and some roads with higher limits still — the motorways. So there would be plenty of scope for travelling swtly when it is safe to do so.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: A conversation with Professor Brendan O’Leary©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves. The vast majority just wonrsquot be able to do this.ldquoIntroducing policy which isnrsquot fit for purpose could have severe consequences.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with.
