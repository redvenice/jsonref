That hurts,’ he said.The Duke added of the Press: ‘Unfortunately, if the source of information is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society.’In an extra clip that did not make the final two-hour cut, Oprah asks Harry if they left the UK because of racism to which he replied: ‘It was a large part of it.’In more additional footage, Meghan said her treatment in the Press had been worse than Kate’s, saying: ‘If a member of his family would comfortably say “we’ve all had to deal with things that are rude”, rude and racist are not the same.’   Royal warfare erupted after Harry and Meghan revealed deeply private and confidential conversations with the royal family to a US journalist friend after they appeared on Oprah, despite claiming it would be their \u0027final word\u0027 on their rift with the royals.The couple told breakfast show host Gayle King the prince had finally spoken to his father and brother - and she went on a major TV network to disclose that the talks ‘were not productive’.Miss King also suggested that Meghan was unhappy that no-one in the Royal Family had picked up the phone to her yet following their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey.And in a thinly-veiled threat, the broadcaster said Meghan had made clear she has ‘documents to back up everything she said on Oprah’s interview’.The fact that the couple chose to discuss such sensitive discussions between senior members of the royal family with a TV journalist, who broadcast them blow-by-blow within hours, met with an icy response from Buckingham Palace. Prince William has insisted that the Royal Family were not racists after Meghan claimed one of them had raised ‘concerns’ about ‘how dark’ her baby’s skin would be, and suggested that they tried to deprive Archie of a title and security because he was of mixed race.She also claimed she had been given so little support by the palace that she suffered suicidal thoughts.For his part, Harry said he felt ‘really let down’ by his father, accused him of cutting him off financially and refusing to take his calls, while revealing there was a gulf between himself and William. In recent days there have been a handful of stories published in the UK reporting that Charles and William felt hurt by what Harry had said, but with very little detail on what was taking place behind the scenes.That was turned on its head when Miss King, who attended Meghan’s lavish baby shower in New York in 2019 and is Miss Winfrey’s closest friend, decided to speak out on her prime time morning show on CBS, the same channel that broadcast the Sussexes’ interview.Harry was accused of ‘embarrassing’ hypocrisy this week for speaking to CBS, which caused outrage in 2004 by showing a photograph of his mother dying in a 1997 car crash in Paris.Miss King told viewers she had called Harry and Meghan at their £10 million California home ‘over the weekend’ to discuss the fall-out from the interview and revealed that they had told her details of their intimate conversations.She said: ‘Well I’m not trying to break news, but I did actually call them to see how they were feeling, and it’s true, Harry has talked to his brother and he has talked to his father too.‘The word I was given was that those conversations were not productive. But they are glad that they have at least started a conversation.’Miss King also claimed that the couple were unhappy that ‘the palace’ had apparently been leaking what they believed were untrue stories to the media, adding: ‘And I think what is still upsetting to them is the palace keep saying they want to work it out privately, but yet, they believe these false stories are coming out that are very disparaging against Meghan, still.’She made clear that the Duchess was unhappy that no-one in the family had called her, despite her making a string of highly inflammatory allegations against several of them in her interview and revealing details of what had been a private conversation between her husband and a family member in which it was alleged an offensive comment had been made.‘No one in the Royal Family has talked to Meghan yet, at this particular time,’ she said.The Sussexes effectively accused the Royal Family and Buckingham Palace of institutional racism in their interview with Miss Winfrey.But Miss King claimed they felt ‘frustrated’ that much of the coverage had focused on this - when they had apparently only wanted to provoke the monarchy into taking action against the media, which they believe has a racist agenda against Meghan.‘I think it’s frustrating for them to see that it’s a racial conversation about the Royal Family when all they wanted all along was for the royals to intervene and tell the Press to stop with the unfair, inaccurate, false stories that definitely have a racial slant,’ Miss King said.‘And until you can acknowledge that, I think it’s going to be hard to move forward. But they both want to move forward with this and they both want healing in this family. At the end of the day, that is Harry’s family.’The broadcaster also raised the investigation launched earlier this month by Buckingham Palace into how claims of bullying against Meghan lodged by a senior member of palace staff were handled.Her former communications secretary, Jason Knauf, complained in 2018 that she had driven out two PAs with her behaviour and was targeting other female members of staff, but nothing was apparently ever done in response to his allegations.Miss King says: ‘The bullying thing was raised in 2018 and now there’s an ongoing investigation about bullying from Meghan Markle, when anyone who has worked with her will tell you exactly who she is. You know, she’s really a very sweet, caring person.’She added: ‘And as I say, Meghan has documents to back up everything that she said on Oprah’s interview. Everything.’In a further discussion about the ongoing family strife and how to resolve it, Miss King seemed to suggest that Harry and Meghan were not satisfied by Buckingham Palace’s response to their bombshell interview and the claims in it.She said: ‘The family has to acknowledge that there are issues. And right now, no-one has acknowledged, “Houston, we have a problem here”. That’s really all they want. They want a conversation. They both want a conversation.’There was no immediate reaction from the Sussexes’s team of PR people - either in London or California - about whether Miss King was speaking at their request.But as one of their closest friends and media allies in the US, it is unthinkable, say insiders, that they would not have at least been aware that she may choose to brief it.Royals aides appeared to be genuinely horrified that either the duke or duchess would personally choose to tell anyone, let alone a television journalist, about intimate and highly confidential conversations that Harry was having with his closest family.They fail to see how it will go any way towards repairing their damaged relationships or rebuilding the family’s shattered trust - on either side.One said: ‘The only positive we can take out of this is that at least they are talking. It would be better from now on, however, if that could be done in private space.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"BA flight LA London declares mid air emergency sick passenger","story":"Share this articleHeathrow live: British Airways flight from Los Angeles to London declares emergency mid-air over Northern Ireland - MyLondon"},{"url":null,"title":"PwC tells 22 000 staff start work want finish want","story":"Share this article He continued: \u0027We want to help enshrine new working patterns so they outlast the pandemic.\u0027Without conscious planning now there\u0027s a risk we lose the best bits of these new ways of working when the economy opens up again.\u0027Companies around the UK are being forced to consider how they will return their staff to work when restrictions end.Under the current schedule, office workers will be able to return to their places of work in June, however this could change if the pandemic shifts.Other companies which have embraced a hybrid model or full-time home working include BP and Nationwide.Laura Hinton, chief people officer at PwC, said: \u0027The policies will be phased in as lockdown restrictions ease and more people return to the office over the coming months.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd58b9547c2632e87b789fc58443db41b662ddc5/0_935_2183_1310/master/2183.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f9f63a1cab1c24b4b65f279eca9154d6","title":"practise mindfulness and five other morning rituals to improve your focus","story":"Arrange a healthy breakfastGetting the right nutrients in your body first thing in the morning is hugely beneficial when it comes to maintaining focus throughout the day. Sheena Skinner, founder of wellness company Detox Health Beauty, swears by options such as porridge with almond butter and chopped banana, or granola with berries and almond or oat milk. “Eating a wide variety of wholegrains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes throughout the day ensures that blood sugar levels are stable and provides the brain with healthy fats, carbohydrates, protein, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals,” she says. “These all work synergistically to promote brain health, focus, memory, concentration, and health in general.” Add an easy-to-achieve goal to your to-do listAccording to Psychology Today, you can manipulate your dopamine levels by setting small goals: “The satisfaction of ticking off a small task is linked with a flood of dopamine. Each time your brain gets a whiff of this rewarding neurotransmitter, it will want you to repeat the associated behaviour.” Train your brainCrosswords and other puzzles are a handy way to pass the time, but they’re also incredibly useful in improving memory and brain function. Dr Gareth Moore, puzzle author, writes in The : “Your brain loves this mental pat on the back, and it can help make life’s larger problems somehow seem easier to tackle. What’s more, those little bursts of joy at finishing a puzzle can help calm your mind, in much the same way that physical exercise can mentally relax you too.” Practise mindfulness and meditationIncorporating simple mindfulness or meditation techniques into your routine will work wonders in lowering stress levels. If you’re unsure where to begin, apps such as Calm and Headspace – which have hundreds of guided meditation practices – are a valuable resource. “Using Calm in the morning allows you to take dedicated time to observe what’s going on with your thoughts and emotions that would otherwise go unnoticed,” Jade Heritage, mindfulness practitioner at Calm, says. “The Daily Calm and Daily Trip – Calm’s two, 10-minute daily meditation offerings – are great tools for beginners or advanced meditators alike to focus on their inner selves and bring mindfulness into the rest of the day. By gaining awareness and not slipping into ‘autopilot’ in your morning routine, you are better able to take care of your needs throughout the day.” Enjoy natureComprehensive and dedicated science exists on the positive mental effects of venturing outdoors and spending time in nature. A study from Stanford University, for example, found that participants who walked through the leafier parts of California experienced a decrease in anxiety and rumination – both of which can negatively affect focus – compared with participants who walked through more urbanised areas. Heading out into nature in the morning, then, could benefit your concentration. If you simply can’t escape the traffic, Halina Rifai, who produces the thought-provoking mental health podcast A Sonic Hug, suggests listening to a podcast: “I can lose myself in them and enjoy my time outdoors.” She says. “It prevents my own overthinking.” Get it all down on paperAnxiety and stress can hamper our ability to stay focused. But according to American psychotherapist and author Barbara Markway, keeping a record of your thoughts on paper is “one of the most useful things you can do to combat stress and anxiety”.

Nonetheless, the sector itself is proving resilient eight out of 10 people, according to a survey conducted by the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) in October, wanted to change their homes as soon as it was safe to do so. “The impact of Covid-19 will affect how and where we choose to live for years to come,” says Riba president Alan Jones. “For many of us, our homes are our sanctuaries, and this research indicates that many people are keener than ever to adapt and improve their homes.” Many interior designers across the UK report an increase in the number of new clients they have taken on. But as the process relies so heavily on being physically present in a space, they have had to adapt. Zoe Hewett is no stranger to finding creative ways around problems. When she first started her interior design business, Stylemongers of Bristol, the former set designer for theatre and TV productions lacked the funds to make over her own home to serve as a showcase – so instead she built a doll’s house to demonstrate her style. As a result of the pandemic, Hewett scaled back her face-to-face work, but has still found ways of expanding her business – one of which is a range of interior design kits to help people design their own homes. “At first, I was thinking about making my services accessible,” she says. “A one-to-one design consultation is worth doing for a bespoke service, but it’s always going to be out of reach for some people, so I wanted to offer something affordable, at a price point more people could afford.” The pandemic meant the project became a priority for her business, and the packs became a reality. “I may have created an envelope-stuffing role for myself,” she says. “But I love that people are getting something physical and tangible to work with.” The packs are made of recycled card and paper and are delivered in letterbox-sized packages. Hewett sees them as a way of sharing the information and techniques that she previously discussed in face-to-face workshops, where she would guide groups through the principles of interior design – from creating moodboards to where to place furniture. They contain, among other things, quizzes to help buyers explore design choices, advice on using colour and materials to create 2D-scale layouts of rooms, plus a link to an ebook with further information. Hewett says the take-up of the £50 kits has been “pretty good. I hope people find them fun as well as useful. One lady who bought one said she’s using it again with her seven-year-old to reimagine their shed. Her daughter’s got really into it, apparently.” From each commission, Hewett makes a donation to the homeless charity Crisis. “Creating nice places is what drives me,” she says. “So it makes sense to me to also help people who haven’t got anywhere to live yet.” The community focus is also important to Liselle Milner of Zenterior Design, based in St Austell, Cornwall. She works with 12 others, including builders, carpenters and upholsterers, to create indoor and outdoor spaces and bespoke furniture, all with a focus on using sustainable materials. Much of her work involves second homes or holiday lets, so the owners have not been able to travel to meet her. “We’ve always focused on the relationship with the client, getting an idea of exactly what it is they want and then making that happen, so to never meet someone face-to-face has been very odd,” she says. “Although, if you are talking to someone via Zoom, there is the advantage of seeing their house in the background, so it’s a very quick way of seeing what they already like.” Milner uses a lot of secondhand or upcycled furniture – “I want the space to look as amazing as possible for the budget we have” – but her pre-pandemic visits to charity shops and auctions have been replaced by Facebook Marketplace, and ever-greater resourcefulness as a team. “We’re looking at things we would usually outsource, like quilting, for example, and thinking: ‘Can we do that ourselves?’” she says. “It’s good creatively, and it also means we can keep to a schedule. Big furniture retailers have set specifics they work to. If a piece is made of oak, and if the oak isn’t there, then that sofa won’t be with you in 12 weeks’ time. But if we are making it, then we can use beech or another suitable wood that we can actually get hold of.” Besides changing their ways of working to comply with pandemic-related restrictions, such as visiting sites inidually instead of together, the Zenterior team have also adapted some of the other physical parts of their jobs, finding ways to keep to social distancing rules, and have stopped working on occupied domestic properties. Milner has also doubled down on Zenterior’s commitment to using local suppliers, not only to avoid delays with supply chains but also from a sense of local responsibility, as the regional tourism sector has been hit especially hard by restrictions on movement. “And there’s also the fact that Cornwall has always been a hub for artists and creative people. It makes sense to work with people who are here,” says Milner. The pandemic may have affected their traditional ways of working for now, but both Milner and Hewett are determined that its lasting effects on our homes are sustainably positive.

Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 225,684 had received their second dose.Some 184,252 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 326,536 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 274,195 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp21,269 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 500 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4525405.1617214336!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland faces critical window to avoid fourth wave of covid 19","story":"A significant increase in close social contact after April 5th would be “highly likely” to cause a fourth wave of Covid-19, Prof Phillip Nolan of NPHET has warned.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinThe country is facing a “critical window” over the next eight weeks, which could see it either face or avoid a fourth wave of Covid-19, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) has said.The Covid-19 situation at present was “stable but precarious”, as the country hovers around 500 new cases a day, Prof Philip Nolan, chair of Nphet’s modelling group, told a press briefing.“If we were to have low or medium increase in close social contact from the 5th April, it is highly likely that would precipitate a fourth wave of the disease,” Prof Nolan said.The current Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions were due to expire on April 5th. On Tuesday, they were extended until April 12th before several measures are gradually eased.Prof Nolan said Ireland was only a number of weeks away from vaccinating enough people to “cut off” the opportunities for the virus to transmit widely.If social mixing could be kept down at current levels until the end of May, the risk posed by Covid-19 would fall substantially, he said.Dr Ronan Glynn, deputy chief medical officer, said the vaccination rollout would “virtually eliminate” the risk of another surge, if people stuck to restrictions for the next eight weeks.If a potential fourth wave could be avoided, Ireland could hope to have something close to a “normal summer”, Dr Glynn said.“If we can see through the next eight weeks, the country will feel like a very different place than it has the last year,” he said.On Wednesday, Nphet reported a further six coronavirus-related deaths and 411 confirmed Covid-19 cases.The current R-number, which is the average amount of people one infected person passes the virus onto, stood between 1 and 1.3.“It doesn’t seem to be getting worse, but unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be getting better,” Prof Nolan said.However, if the R-number increased in the coming weeks, as some restrictions on outdoor activities are eased, “we would be in real difficulty,” he said.If the R-number rose to 1.5 in early April, this could lead to a spike of the virus and see more than 400 people hospitalised, and more than 100 in intensive care.If increased social contacts saw the R-number hit two, the country could see a wave of the virus similar to January, with close to 1,600 Covid-19 patients in hospital, and 500 people in intensive care.In such a fourth wave “fatality rates would be significantly lower” than in January, due to the vaccination of those in nursing homes and the vulnerable over-70s, Prof Nolan said.Dr Glynn said people were “obviously much more fatigued”, following what had been “such a difficult year”. Yet as the incidence of the virus remained at a relatively high rate, “things can go wrongly quickly and easily,” he said.Despite huge efforts made by the public, the country was in “a much much worse position” than in the days before Christmas, he said. This was largely due to the now widespread presence of the more transmissible B117 variant.Prof Pete Lunn, of the ESRI behavioural research unit, said while compliance with restrictions remained high, “the behaviour of a minority is increasing the risk for all of us.”Research into people’s behaviour showed there had been “clear slippage” in adherence to restrictions recently, with a rise in social visits between homes.People who had been strictly adhering to the regulations were now “pushing the boundaries a little bit”, Prof Lunn said.However, there was a “misperception” that the majority of people expected society to fully reopen in the near future, he said. ESRI research showed people were not “queuing at the gates to get back out there”, he said.In fact, the majority of people estimated it would be between nine and 12 months until all Covid-19 restrictions would be lifted for good, he said.ExpandedMeanwhile, the North’s vaccination programme has been expanded to include people aged between 45 and 49.The online booking service for the injection opened on Wednesday, with people born between April 1st, 1971, and March 31st, 1976, invited to make an appointment at either a vaccination centre or community pharmacy.People can also choose to wait until their GP contacts them.The North’s Minister for Health, Robin Swann, said he urged everyone who was eligible to “get the jab as soon as possible”. He received his first dose of the vaccine later on Wednesday.According to the Northern Ireland Department of Health’s most recent figures, as of Wednesday 887,598 doses of vaccine have been administered, which includes 749,112 first doses.The North reported no further deaths with Covid-19 on Wednesday, leaving the total recorded by the department at 2,115.An additional 123 people tested positive for the virus.As of midnight on Tuesday 118 people with coronavirus were receiving hospital treatment in the North, with 17 in intensive care.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4520165.1616687940!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british government guidance on union flag reignites ni debate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLoyalist protesters converge on Belfast City Hall in 2013 over removal of the union flag from the the building. File photograph: PAThe British government’s latest guidance on flying of the union flag in England, Scotland and Wales has prompted unionist politicians to call for the standard to be flown year round on government buildings in Northern Ireland.Unionists also have linked the flags issue to the Northern Ireland protocol. This has led to an Irish Sea border and the disruption of trade from Britain to the North.On Wednesday the British government called on all local councils to fly the union flag on civic buildings as a sign of British national identity. This was part of an initiative to promote the union of Britain and Northern Ireland.The guidance, however, does not apply to Northern Ireland where the union flag flies over government buildings on about 20 designated days annually.At the end of 2012 and through 2013 Northern Ireland and Belfast in particular was subjected to serious loyalist violence, protests and business disruption after Belfast City Council voted that the flag should fly over city hall on the designated days and not all-year round.DUP Lagan Valley MP Jeffrey Donaldson said on Thursday that flying the ensign 365 days a year over British government buildings should be extended to Northern Ireland.“Many will see it as bizarre that the UK government is only deciding in 2021 to fly the union flag, the flag of our nation, on all government buildings every day. When I visit other nations around the world, flying the national flag on government buildings is commonplace,” he said.Mr Donaldson added that if the British government “wanted to immediately improve the union they would start with the removal of the protocol”.The Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) party also called for the flag to fly every day over government buildings.Meanwhile unionists, as they had threatened, launched a legal action aimed at scrapping the protocol. They also started a crowdfunding appeal to help pay for the actionwhich is being taken by a coalition of pro-union politicians such as DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster, former Ulster Unionist first minister David (Lord) Trimble and former Labour MP Kate (Baroness) Hoey.Ms Foster said the DUP would work with other unionists to send a “united message to our government and to free Northern Ireland from the protocol. We cannot allow our United Kingdom to be ripped apart and our UK internal market to be ided in order to protect the single market of the EU.”Lord Trimble said he joined in the action “because Northern Ireland’s place as an integral part of the United Kingdom is at stake. Extensive parts of Northern Ireland – much of its economic fabric – have been turned into a colony of the European Union. ”UUP leader Steve Aiken said the “protocol fundamentally undermines the integrity of the United Kingdom, the Belfast Agreement and the principle of consent”.TUV leader Jim Allister said the “protocol annexes Northern Ireland into the EU, leaving us subject to laws we did not make and cannot change”.Baroness Hoey said she was “not prepared to allow those living in Northern Ireland to be treated as second-class citizens of our own country – the UK”.Former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib said the UK was “the only country in history to have voluntarily partitioned itself. We must not rest until the protocol is ended. It is vital that all pro-unionists join together in this fight.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4525028.1617200393!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coalition exceeded nphet advice to allow under 18 sport at end april","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA letter from the National Public Health Emergency Team stated that the health system is said to remain ‘extremely fragile’.  Photograph: Collins The Government went beyond advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) in its decision to allow under-18s return to sports training at the end of April.The latest letter from the team also warns that the risk of a fourth coronavirus wave would be “very high” if public health measures are relaxed too quickly.The Cabinet agreed on Tuesday to permit an extension of the 5km travel restriction to a countywide or 20km limit and a gradual easing of restrictions on outdoor activities from April 12th. Outdoor meetings of two households will be allowed, but not in private gardens from that date.Sporting activities can also return, with training by GAA senior county teams and some high-performing athletes permitted from April 19th. Non-contact sports including tennis, golf and underage training will be permitted from April 26th.The team’s correspondence came on Monday ahead of the Cabinet’s deliberations on easing restrictions. The Government adhered to most of its advice in relation to measures such as easing the 5km travel limit and allowing outdoor meetings. But the letter also signalled that underage sports should not return until May and then on a phased basis beginning with under-13s.The letter indicates that the health system is said to remain “extremely fragile”, with an “exhausted” workforce after the most recent wave of infections. The number of patients in hospital and critical care remains high and there are more people in critical care compared with the peak of the second wave of the virus.The team said the third wave of the virus caused “extensive disruption” to non-Covid care. It noted rising waiting lists since February 2020 for inpatient care (up 21 per cent), outpatient care (up 12 per cent) and gastrointestinal scopes (up 62 per cent).The letter stated: “Any resurgence in Covid-19 will cause inevitable further disruption to non-Covid services. It is also important to note that the rollout of the vaccination programme also is likely to further displace non-Covid care over the coming period.”In its advice, the team said the “approach in the near term must continue to be one of extreme caution, with the focus remaining on protecting the gains of the last three months and protecting the core national priorities until vaccination can offer more widespread protection”.‘Cautious approach’It recommends a “cautious, slow and phased approach” to easing restrictions with sufficient time between each change to assess its impact and respond to changes in the epidemiological situation.The team noted the core priorities are to protect the vulnerable as vaccines are rolled out, to safeguard the health service and shield education and childcare services.The team also said there is “limited scope” for easing measures at this time. Though it added that some measures are warranted to “improve societal wellbeing and quality of life”.Level 5 restrictions, it noted, should be extended from April 5th and reviewed at the end of the month once time has elapsed to assess the impact of a full return to education on April 12th.It suggested easing travel restrictions from April 12th to enable movement within a county or up to 20km from a person’s home across a county boundary, with outdoor assemblies to be allowed in public between two households.It said the 20km rule should be adopted only “if deemed to be operationally enforceable”.The team advised that golf and tennis facilities could return on April 26th and outdoor visitor attractions such as zoos could open on the same day.The limit on numbers attending funerals could rise to 25, also on April 26th.The team said: “Consideration will also be given to the phased return of non-contact outdoor training, starting with the under-13s in May.”The Government announced that under-18s sports training can begin again on April 26th. Participants will have to train in pods of 15 and outdoor dance classes are also allowed to return on that date.Nphet bulletinIn its letter Nphet said the measures it outlines are “in of themselves relatively low risk if all appropriate protective measures are taken”. However, “it is essential that they are not interpreted as a signal that wider socialisation and inter-household interactions are acceptable or appropriate at this time”. The team advised that even with a continuation of all other Level 5 measures “it is likely that the profile of the disease will deteriorate at least to some extent over the coming weeks”. It said it was conscious of the upcoming Easter holiday period and acknowledged the particular burden that restrictions place on the population over traditional festive periods. But the team stressed the importance of “continued public buy-in and adherence to all measures” over Easter. “Given the current disease profile, it is essential that there is no increased mobility or socialisation, inter-household andor intergenerational mixing should be avoided, and people should remain in their normal place of residence over the Easter period,” noted the team. It said its proposals for easing restrictions over Easter are “modest” but said if public health measures are adhered to “for a relatively short period of time (fully acknowledging the difficulties this poses for people and their families), we can be confident that we will be in a much better position as we enter the summer months.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4524939.1617217734!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"green party tds and senators back call for chu to step aside","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party chairwoman Hazel Chu’s decision to run for the Seanad has angered some members of the parliamentary party. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsA majority of Green Party TDs and Senators have supported a call for Dublin Lord Mayor Hazel Chu to step aside as chairwoman of the party for the duration of her bid to be elected to the Seanad. The vote took place at a private meeting of the parliamentary party where the mood was said to range from “sombre” to “rancorous”. However, while the motion was passed by 11 votes to five, exceeding the required two-thirds majority, the parliamentary party does not have the power to make her step aside from the role. The result is to be communicated to the Executive Committee which does have the ability to do this. It is understood the committee would have to go through its own deliberative process and possibly its own vote on whether or not Ms Chu should step aside as chairwoman.Earlier, Ms Chu said that requests for her to step aside should be handled by the party’s executive committee, not its group of TDs and Senators. Senators Pauline O’Reilly, Pippa Hackett and Róisín Garvey tabled the motion calling for Ms Chu to stand aside from her chairwoman role for the three weeks of the Seanad byelection campaign. A previous motion of no confidence in Ms Chu put forward by the three Senators was withdrawn from the agenda of the meeting. The Green Party had agreed not to run a candidate in the byelection and support Gerry Horkan of Fianna Fáil. Party leader Eamon Ryan wanted the party’s TDs and Senators to support the candidates put forward by the other Coalition parties – Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael – on the understanding that they would back a Green Party candidate if other vacancies arise.However, Ms Chu secured a nomination to stand as an Independent candidate. The party’s deputy leader Catherine Martin was among those who signed Ms Chu’s nomination papers.At the weekend, Ms Martin said her decision to nominate Ms Chu was because: “I’m a woman in politics, who has spent her life supporting, helping women to get into politics.“To say no to a woman who seeks a nomination, that simply wouldn’t make sense to me.”Ms Chu has said that any request for her to stand aside, even temporarily, should be handled by the executive committee, not the parliamentary party. “Motions passed by other bodies of the party are not binding, and so any issues raised by the parliamentary party around my position as Cathaoirleach should be directed to the executive.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4525078.1617201236!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"online registration for covid 19 vaccine from mid april says martin","story":"The Taoiseach has said that it is the intention of the Covid-19 vaccination taskforce to have a website allowing people to register for a coronavirus vaccine available from the third week in April.

He said that in the first three months of the year the Government knew the volume of vaccines received would be low.“The data is much stronger for the second quarter for April, May and June, and the target is to have 80 per cent not just offered vaccination, but vaccinated by the end of June. That is the target.”He said there will be “intense vaccination” during the summer months, with more companies coming on stream to supply jabs, such as Johnson \u0026amp Johnson.Mr Martin told Social Democrats TD Gary Gannon that the target is for 80 per cent of people to have had their first dose by end of June, and for 70 per cent to be fully vaccinated by the end of July.He hoped that “in July and August we will be at the latter end of the vaccination programme”.As it emerged that 800,000 people have so far received at least one vaccine, teachers, gardaí, special needs assistants (SNAs) and family carers have expressed outrage at the overnight change in policy which they said was announced without any consultation.When it was raised in the Dáil Mr Martin said “the evidence that the National Immunisation Advisory Committee have put together, and Nphet are saying is that the biggest factor in mortality and severe illness arising from Covid is age.“Many older teachers, many older key workers more generally will now be vaccinated much more quickly.” ‘Great news’Labour leader Alan Kelly who highlighted the changes in vaccination prioritisation said “I hope and pray that you deliver because gardaí, SNA, teachers, carers, retail workers will feel very let down if you don’t”.He said the Government is “putting all your eggs in the vaccine basket”. Mr Kelly said it was “great news” that by the end of June 80 per cent of those over 16 will be offered a vaccine, but how many of them will actually get it”?The Tipperary TD also asked about the portal being offered to everyone in April to be able to apply for a vaccine.Vaccination is a key part in exiting the pandemic and measures the Government adopted “are essentially designed to continue to keep the pressure on the virus particularly over the next while”.The Government does not want to “now take risks which have the consequence of increasing prevalence of the disease, putting more pressure on hospitals before the summer even starts and potentially leaving the rest of the summer to mop up if there was an escalation”.Independent TD Michael McNamara said healthy young people, who had recovered from Covid-19 and who work in the health service, were among the first to be vaccinated but the evidence showed the virus was no threat to them and they did not need inoculation. Mr Martin said the advice was to vaccinate all frontline workers as a cohort.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4523374.1617053574!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"post brexit focus should be on building relationships not border poll says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told Senators Government could get Northern Ireland protocol ‘back on an even keel’. File photograph: Alan Betson Northern Ireland institutions are “just about hanging on” after a “bruising number of years” and the focus must be on building relationships rather than on a border poll, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Mr Coveney also told the Seanad that “we can move away from threats of legal action” after the UK’s unilateral move to extend the grace period for post-Brexit checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain until October 1st.During a debate on Brexit he told Senators,“we can get back to partnership through a specialised committee and joint committee” and can get the Northern Ireland protocol “back on an even keel”.He also said it was an opportunity for “more pragmatism and flexibility from the European Commission as well”.The Minister admitted that “I’ve become some sort of a bogey man” over the protocol but “the irony is” that his office more than any other “has been constantly talking to the European Commission about need to for pragmatism and compromise”.In an impassioned contribution he said the narrative “now is that it is being foisted on Northern Ireland by the EU and Irish Government and it’s not”.The protocol “was designed as much in London as it was in Brussels, which people seem to conveniently forget”, he pointed out.It is a solution “that isn’t perfect but is certainly the best way of mitigating the disruption on the island of Ireland”.He warned that a collapse in the protocol would result in two “very unpalatable choices” for Ireland.To protect Ireland’s place in the EU market, the State would have to put some kind of border infrastructure in place, which would be politically impossible “or we would be taken out of the EU market by default”.United IrelandSpeaking about calls for a border poll on a united Ireland, Mr Coveney said the focus had to be on building relationships first because the Northern Ireland institutions are not functioning as they should. They are “just about hanging on” after a “bruising number of years”.He said that “perhaps the most challenging element of Brexit” was in how to rebuild relationships “that have undoubtedly been damaged.“Good things happen in Northern Ireland when the British and Irish governments work together,” he added.Earlier Fianna Fáil Senator Niall Blaney said there is no border in the Irish Sea and “we should knock that every chance we get”. He said “it is an imaginary border”.The Donegal Senator said unionists are in an awkward position and “we don’t need to do anything that ramps that up but rather the opposite”.He said those calling for a North-South poll needed to be reminded “of how the Good Friday Agreement was won”.He said a similar sentiment is needed now “this country coming together as one isn’t necessarily about territory but is more about people”.He said of Fianna Fáil’s relationship with Sinn Féin that “we sometimes rub each other up the wrong way” but everyone had work to do for a border poll “down the road” and Sinn Féin needed to put more emphasis on building relationships with unionists.

File photograph: The Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said it was not the practice when he was minister for health to “deliberately go out and authorise the collection of data” on inidual children.He said it would be “wrong and unethical” for any official to ask a doctor or consultant for such information. But he acknowledged that the RTÉ Investigates team had evidence that this happened “in respect of one case”.The programme alleged the Department of Health compiled secret dossiers including sensitive personal information on children with autism involved in legal action against the State.“No department official or anyone in government should ever seek to approach clinicians” seeking the files of children involved illegal cases, Mr Martin said.“I am not clear yet as to whether that happened in any systemic way,” in the department.The Taoiseach also said Lexi Ford, the seven-year-old child with special needs whose parents were told she would have to wait until 2026 for school supports, would not have to wait for such services.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the parents “have been left crying and literally begging for services for their daughter” whose case was highlighted in the media.She said the case came on the back of “shocking revelations” about the department setting out to gather information to “ exert pressure, damage reputations, stall and silence these families” who were taking legal action because of the State’s failure to provide vital services and therapies.Mr Martin said Lexi “ will not have to wait until 2026. We will make sure that is the case. No child should have to wait that length of time.”Speaking about the RTÉ Investigates programme the Taoiseach said the department did not accept the allegations and “is conducting a rigorous review”.But he told Ms McDonald “any breach of patient-client confidentiality or any attempt by any official or anybody to ring up a doctor or consultant, as happened – they had documentation in respect of one case – would be totally wrong and unethical”.A number of TDs have demanded that all current Ministers who previously held the portfolio should attend before the Oireachtas health committee to answer questions on the controversy. ‘State does not fight fair’Ms McDonald asked if it was the practice in Mr Martin’s time in the role.He replied that “it was not a practice when I was minister for health of deliberately going out either to authorise the collection of data in respect of inidual children or families.“I would not, in any set circumstances, support any department seeking, for example, to breach patient-client confidentiality. That would be intolerable, unacceptable and unethical.”Earlier Sinn Féin health spokesman David Cullinane said carers have been wrongly forced by successive governments to fight for their children’s basic rights and the “abhorrent practices” uncovered by RTÉ demonstrated “the State does not fight fair”.The Seanad on Monday debated the issue when Minister of State at the Department of Children Anne Rabbitte thanked the whistleblower who made a protected disclosure and said she could not stand over the system which “needs to stop now” and a new more transparent system put in place to manage such legal cases.Ms Rabbitte also said interim secretary general of the Department of Health Robert Watt had informed her “it is the intention” to publish the €10,000 independent review by a senior counsel which had not identified any breaches of the data protection laws.The department is getting legal advice about publication of the report. Ms Rabbitte said “we must acknowledge that while what happened may have been lawful, does not mean it was right. Driving without a seat belt used to be lawful, it doesn’t mean it was ever right.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4525033.1617191692!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the us must be pragmatic when picking its allies","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Joe Biden: Can hardly operate a “democracies only” rule for local allies. Photograph: Stefani ReynoldsCNPBloombergUnborn generations will take some persuading that it all began with washing machines. In three years, the US-China rift has widened from the banalities of trade to something like a clash of philosophic systems.An original belligerent, Donald Trump, seems ever tamer in retrospect. Imagine the former US president invoking the “freedom-loving nations” against Beijing, as his secretary of state did last year. Or setting out to disprove, like his successor Joe Biden, that “autocracy is the wave of the future”.Mercantile cynicism has its uses. A current account imbalance is negotiable in a way that “values” are not. If Trump was the first US leader since Jimmy Carter to not start a new war, that welcome omission flowed from something dark: his indifference to the internal depredations of foreign governments. Those who cheer the return of idealism in US statecraft do so well-meaningly. But then they must also budget for the messy implications.The stress on values does not just raise the stakes of the superpower contest. It also ties America’s hands in the winning of it. Biden has set out on the long game of weaving a network of states (“alliance”, never mind “coalition”, seems too much) that worry about China. This month’s visit to New Delhi by defence secretary Lloyd Austin was suggestive. So too was the inaugural summit of the Quad that links India, Japan and Australia to the US.Asinine slursThis diplomatic work is harder, and the resulting strength in numbers more formidable, than direct confrontation with Beijing. To that extent, Republican slurs about Democratic softness on China are as asinine as ever. Once more, though, liberal values have perverse consequences. The US can be morally scrupulous. It can string together a mighty web of friends. But it cannot achieve both feats at the same time.Is the US going to refrain from courting, say, Thailand, on the basis of its lapses into junta rule or its lèse majesté laws? As the Philippines blows hot and cold, will Biden stop bidding for its loyalty if its populist government breaks a liberal norm too many? As for the largest potential friendship of all, that with India, is there anything prime minister Narendra Modi could do there to make the US spurn so grand a prize?None of these are fantastic hypotheticals. They are real, recent or plausible scenarios. And they say nothing of the yet harder choices that await the US outside Asia. In countering Chinese, or Russian, influence in the Middle East and Africa, Biden can hardly operate a “democracies only” rule for local allies. Too many countries flunk that test but remain tantalisingly poised between the big powers. It would be an act of masochistic self-denial to let them slip into a rival’s morally undemanding patronage. But then, after the “America is back” noises, it would be a loss of face to embrace illiberal partners.In this way, the administration will hit its head from time to time against the moral bar it has set itself. The more rigorously Biden applies US values, the narrower his strategic options will be. The more he observes them in the breach, the higher the cost in US trustworthiness and credibility. For a 78-year-old man, the predicament is only softened by its eerie familiarity. His country struggled with it for much of his life.Cold warThe US-Soviet conflict was an inexact trailer for today’s great power tussle. Communism was a mostly closed world: a “cold war” with the globe’s number one goods trader will take some doing. Still, one theme promises to hold and that is the company the US had to keep, or felt it had to keep, against the lapping tides of communism. The Greek colonels, the Pakistani generals, the gallery of rogues in Latin America: it was at times a flexible sort of free world that America led.If anything, the temptation of moral compromise is far stronger now. The frontline of the cold war was Europe, which had democratic governments in place from Dublin to Bonn. There are prominent examples of those in Asia, the new zone of competition, but there are also military rulers, technocratic city states, one-party systems, vulnerable democracies and established ones trending the wrong way.If Antony Blinken’s commitment to “support democracy around the world” while abjuring force is to mean anything, the secretary of state must be willing to pass up convenient relationships out of liberal principle. The regional winner, if he does, hardly needs naming. And so he probably won’t. There is no disgrace at all in such pragmatism. But there is disillusion and acrimony stored up in pretensions to the opposite. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4525263.1617207584!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no evidence to support restricting astrazeneca use says medicines agency","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe EMA has received reports of 44 rare blood clotting cases among 9.2 million people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine across the European Economic Area. Photograph:  Alex KrausBloombergThere is currently no evidence to support restricting the use of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine to certain ages, the European Medicines Agency announced after the German regulator joined several countries in limiting its use to older people.“According to the current scientific knowledge, there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population,” EMA chief Emer Cooke announced, following a review of evidence by the body.“The benefits of the vaccine outweigh possible side effects.”It comes after German health officials agreed on Tuesday to restrict the use of the vaccine to people aged over 60 due to very rare blood clot cases seen in some people who received the vaccine.The EMA has received reports of 44 rare blood clotting cases among 9.2 million people who received the vaccine across the European Economic Area.Currently there is no evidence that the vaccine was the cause of these illnesses, which occur anyway in the population, though Ms Cooke said a link was “possible” and that the investigation would continue.The blood clots mostly occurred in younger women, who are at a higher risk of such illnesses and made up the bulk of those who have received AstraZeneca vaccines in the EU.This is linked to the fact that the jabs were initially restricted to younger groups by some national regulators, and were therefore particularly given to health workers, who are predominantly female.Most countries have resumed use of the vaccine after several including Ireland suspended its use as a precaution during the EMA’s initial investigation earlier this month.However, France has chosen to limit its use to people aged over 55 and Canada followed suit on Monday. Norway and Denmark have not yet resumed administering the vaccines, pending further evidence.Following its safety review, the EMA added the rare blood clot events as possible side effects to the information booklet that accompanies the AstraZeneca vaccine, providing health workers and patients with a list of symptoms to be aware of just in case.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4523761.1617082881!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ten eu states to halt extraditions to uk following brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe European Arrest Warrant was introduced in 2004 and obliges member states to arrest and transfer suspects to countries where they were wanted.Ten EU member states have said they will no longer extradite their nationals to the UK following Brexit, the British Home Office has said.Countries including France, Germany and Poland have informed the UK of their refusal to allow the extradition of their nationals.Two more — Austria and the Czech Republic — will only hand over suspects to the UK with their consent.The European Arrest Warrant was introduced in 2004 and obliged member states to arrest and transfer suspects to countries where they were wanted.The letter, sent from the Home Office to the House of Lords EU committee dates from earlier this month and was first reported by The Times.It said: “I can confirm a total of 10 EU Member States have notified of their intention to exercise an absolute bar on the extradition of own nationals.

Her brief attendance went unnoticed by the vast majority of people at the memorial.A royal source said on the day. “The Duchess wanted to pay her respects to Sarah and her family. She remembers what it felt like to walk around London at night before she got married.”Dame Cressida also said politicians and public figures should “stop and think” before criticising police tactics.Her comments follow publication of a report by Her Majesty\u0027s Inspectorate of Constabulary, Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS), which found  the force had acted appropriately when it broke up the vigil for Ms Everard at Clapham Common after her abduction and murder allegedly by a Met officer.Scotland Yard came in for intense criticism over its handling of the vigil, with some even calling for Dame Cressida to resign.But Matt Parr, the inspector, who carried out the review, at the behest of Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, said much of the criticism had been unwarranted and showed a lack of respect to the police. However, he suggested their response to the criticism could have been more conciliatory.The HMICFRS report revealed that the Silver Commander on duty at Clapham Common on March 13 only learnt of the Duchess\u0027s visit only when it was reported by Sky News.It said: While we understand that it may be the tactic of protection teams to minimise pre-warning of VIPs’ movements, this is a matter of concern. The incident illustrates the absence of effective communication to the Silver Commander about changing events on the ground.Dame Cressida Dick has said the politan Police treated Sarah Everard\u0027s vigil as an unlawful gathering.She said: It was clearly possible under the law for somebody who lived locally to walk as many did and lay flowers legally, there are other reasons why people might be in the area and they could have laid flowers calmly and peacefully, potentially legally.You would have seen for six hours we did not enforce any laws, we showed some discretion and we allowed people to carry on.Dame Cressida added: We knew that it would result in a mass gathering, we knew there would be large numbers, we knew who would come, we knew it would be unlawful.I had a great deal of contact both with City Hall at the most senior levels and with senior members of the Government.She went on to say: What I was saying consistently was this is likely to be illegal, if it is illegal and people do not disperse when they\u0027re asked to do so, we will use as much discretion as we can, we will encourage people, we will try to get them to disperse, but if they don\u0027t disperse we will end up arresting people.She said some people had spoken out in the immediate aftermath of the Clapham Common vigil without knowing the facts.I think there are two things that come out of this report about the immediate aftermath. The first is that people in public life, people in responsible positions, should stop and think before they judge, whoever they may be.She added: People should stop and think, because if they comment without knowing the facts, they may - and I would suggest on this occasion some people did - affect public confidence in their police service inappropriately.And secondly affect the officers\u0027 confidence about volunteering for the same duty in the next instance, if they are actually going to be criticised even when they\u0027ve done a really good job.Dame Cressida said the force would consider whether it lacked empathy in the communications after the vigil.She said: The report suggests that if we had been slightly more conciliatory, I think was the word, in our communications afterwards, then that might have helped with what I think is in modern-day parlance a kind of social media pile-on.Asked if she accepted that, she said: We have to go away and think about that, of course we do. We have to see whether ... we lacked empathy.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emmanuel macron expected announce strict new lockdown measures","story":"Emmanuel Macron has announced strict new month-long measures including closing schools for three weeks, abandoning his efforts to keep France out of a third coronavirus lockdown.  The French president  had ignored the pleas of his scientific advisors to close up the country in January but the spread of the contagious British variant and spiking infections forced him into a U-turn. We will lose control if we do not move now, he said in a televised address. Non-essential shops will be closed and travel more than 10km from home is forbidden, unless there is a good reason. Travel between French regions is banned from April 5. People must work from home if they can and a 7pm curfew will stay in place, as Mr Macron extended measures in some French regions to the whole country. Mr Macron had hoped to pursue a “third way” of fighting coronavirus without ordering people to stay at home and keeping the economy as open as possible. In February it had appeared that Mr Macron’s gamble had paid off with cases flatlining under a curfew but with shops and schools open. He was forced to act after daily coronavirus cases doubled to about 40,000 and hospitals in infection hotspots like Paris were swamped. 44 percent of people in intensive care with Covid were below 65, he said. On Wednesday night, in a primetime television address, Mr Macron defended his decision to keep France out of lockdown. He insisted that every day the country was open was a day gained in the fightback for economic recovery. He said that unlike Germany or Italy, which were in their fourth lockdowns, France had enjoyed “precious days of freedom”. We have opted since the beginning of 2021 for a response that aimed to curb the epidemic without locking down, Mr Macron said.“We have won precious days of freedom, weeks of education for our children, without ever losing control of the epidemic. I think it was the right thing to do.France’s slow vaccination campaign and his refusal to lockdown earlier have put the French President under pressure from politicians and medical experts. “We could have done better, we have made some mistakes, all of this is true, he said. Mr Macron, a vocal supporter of the EU’s discredited vaccine procurement strategy, faces elections next year and far right leader Marine Le Pen is rising in the polls.Ms Le Pen said: The measures announced by Macron are the result of a vaccination Waterloo for which he does not take responsibility.France has administered about 10.7m jabs, far fewer than the UK’s 30.9 million doses. Mr Macron said France would step up its vaccinations and reassured people that all the jabs, including AstraZeneca, were safe and effective. He said vets would be drafted in to join the mass vaccination campaign. Thanks to vaccination, the end of the crisis is finally within reach, he said. Mr Macron last reluctantly imposed tougher restrictions on March 20, closing non-essential shops and introducing travel restrictions, in Paris and other regions of the country.  The rules, which allowed people to meet outside and schools to stay open, hit about a third of the population. The French lockdown was announced as Britain introduces new rules from April 6 aimed at preventing new variants entering the UK. Lorry drivers, cabin crew and seasonal workers entering England will have to take a Covid test within 48 hours of arrival from April 6. Despite the setback, the avidly pro-EU Mr Macron, who falsely claimed the Oxford University jab was quasi-ineffective in the over 65s in January, is still expected to beat the Eurosceptic Ms Le Pen in elections. He is among the toughest of EU leaders on the ongoing row over vaccine supplies with Britain. He supported Ursula von der Leyen’s calls for tough vaccine export rules aimed at the UK at a summit last week and vowed that Brussels would block any export of AstraZeneca until it made up shortfalls of millions of doses to the bloc.It came as the head of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said there is “no evidence” to support restricting the use of AstraZeneca in any population, after Germany suspended its use over blood clot fears. The EU’s drugs regulator said that a causal link between unusual blood clots was “not proven but is possible” but added that the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks. EMA executive director Emer Cooke said 62 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis have been reviewed out of 9.2 million people in the European Economic Area.There were no specific risk factors such as age or gender for the “very rare” blood clots, she said. According to the current scientific knowledge, there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population, she said. The German medicines regulator reported 31 cases of a type of rare brain blood clot among the nearly 2.7 million people who received the AstraZeneca jab in the country. Some regions including Berlin have banned the jab for people under the age of 60. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"just 12 countries could safely opened uk holidaymakers june","story":"Only a dozen countries could be safely opened to British holidaymakers by June under a traffic light system, an analysis of vaccination and Covid rates shows.As Boris Johnson prepares to unveil the framework for resuming foreign travel from May 17, only a handful of European countries will be low enough risk to permit quarantine-free holidays in early summer, according to the analysis.Travellers returning from such green list countries are still likely to be required to pay for lateral flow tests in order to go on holiday but are expected to escape quarantine under the plans.They include the traditional holiday destinations of Malta, Gibraltar, Portugal and Israel, which are expected to have vaccinated at least half their adult populations by May 17, maintained low Covid and variant rates and have comprehensive testing regimes.Three more popular destinations – Spain, Greece and Turkey – would be on a putative amber list, where it is likely any travellers would be expected to have a pre-departure test within 72 hours of return, a test on arrival and at least three days quarantine.Others on the green list include the USA, which aims to have its adult population vaccinated at least once by mid-May, Canada, Barbados and the United Arab Emirates, according to the analysis by The PC Consultancy.On Monday, the Prime Minister is expected to confirm plans for a staged return to foreign travel based on a traffic light-style system but without naming any destinations.It is still too early to say where and when people will be able to go on holidays, but there will be detail about what that will look like, said a Government source.The global travel task force chaired by Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is due to report a week later, on April 12, setting out how travel will be resumed no earlier than May 17.Travel industry chiefs anticipate most countries are unlikely to open as green list destinations for  British holidaymakers until July or August. The biggest concern within Government is the risk from new variants that could undermine the efficacy of the UK\u0027s successful vaccination programme.It means foreign travel from red list countries at high risk of new variants will remain banned and any returning Britons will have to quarantine in Government-approved hotels.Ministers are expected to meet at the Covid O Cabinet committee on Thursday to review global travel but are not expected to add any European countries to the 35-strong red list.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

Celia Walsh bought the frozen Birds Eye product as a treat for when her grandkids came to visit her home in Birkenhead, Wirral. Because the lockdown made the trip impossible, the -year-old decided to cook the marine treats for herself, Liverpool Echo reports. She put them in a sandwich and tucked in when suddenly her tooth struck something metallic. Celiaaposs daughter Dee explained: She felt something grinding against her tooth. At first she thought a filling had fallen out. Then when she took it out she saw something flash and realised they looked like two metal batteries. They were small, like those found in hearing aids or watches, and very rusted and corroded. Celia visited her GP who told her to head to hospital so she could get an X-ray. Fortunately it didnapost show up anything untoward, meaning the grandma could leave with the order to let the hospital know immediatelyshe later felt ill. Dee said they took the contaminated product back to where it was bought - Farmfoods supermarket in Prenton, Wirral - who offered to get in contact with Birds Eye. She said: I thought as it had happened to us, it should be us who contacted them. My mumaposs main concern was these were bought so she could feed the grandkids. What would have happened one of these batteries  At first Birds Eye wanted to know whether my mum wore a hearing aid or a watch and whether the battery might have fallen in that way, but I told them that the food had come out of the freezer and straight into the oven. After an investigation, Birds Eye said it did not understand how the batteries came to be in the food but sent Celia two £ vouchers to make up for the experience.  Dee said: I donapost really think thataposs good enough, considering what could have happened. It was a big shock to my mum and myself. At the very least, they should have done a product recall. Farmfoods did not wish to make a comment while Birds Eye has been contacted. In a letter Birds Eye sent to Celia Walsh following their investigation they said the company was truly sorry we are to hear that youaposve found these metal batteries in your Birds Eye Fish Nuggets. It continued: Our quality is extremely important to us, and our teams thoroughly check all of our food before it leaves our factories. Weaposre therefore really keen to understand what happened and get to the bottom of it for you. Having thoroughly looked into it, weaposve been unable to find where the batteries have come from. Weaposve looked at the full production line, and all the equipment has been checked to make sure nothing is missing, the batteries are not recognised as anything used inside our factory. Birds Eye said the issue seems to be a one off and that we do everything possible to make sure this doesnapost happen.

More than  million Britons have received their first Covid- shots in the fastest vaccine rollout in Europe, with the aim of offering shots to all adults by the end of July. However, Britain has found itself involved in a public spat with the European Union, where the vaccination programme has been much slower, over the supply of doses.  I think our focus has to be to try and keep Britain safe, we want to work cooperatively as well with other countries but the main priority is to get the vaccine rollout, Kwarteng told Sky News.

Another few minutes, and Boris Johnson’s we might have caught him with his mistress in their family home. Another few weeks of successful vaccine rollout, and Boris Johnson’s country might have forgotten the true measure of the man. The Mirror’s Jenner Arcuri world exclusive has come at the perfect moment.Just when we were feeling grateful – as jab success takes centre stage, nudging his pitul pandemic performance into the background, a reminder that we’ve all been screwed by Boris Johnson.As poet Maya Angelou famously said: “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” This is a bloke with such little respect for the mother of four of his children that he not only cheats on her, he can’t even be bothered to travel anywhere to do it.He doesn’t cover his tracks, but s***s where he eats, just before she gets home. He has sex on the family sofa with someone who takes a sneaky selfie in the kitchen – ie fully expects a time to come when she’ll need proof she was there.  That same sofa is where his kids sat – yesterday  That morning  Straight afterwards  – to watch telly.If only we could have been vaccinated so we were immune to the traumatic mental images Jenner’s tell-all has left us with.Lost socks, limp pasta, and – Et tu, Boris  – pretentious Shakespeare chat as foreplay.What light through yonder window breaks  Well hopefully not the headlamps on your we’s car, eh   Jenner Arcuri had to text Johnson afterwards to tell him to wash the plates they’d eaten off, take out the bin bag she’d thrown her tights away in.Even at the height of her feelings for the man she was “enchanted” with, she still knew he was either too stupid or too arrogant to work out that he needed to remove the evidence from the scene of the crime. Jenner was awarded a total of £, – coincidentally a pound for every coronavirus victim who has died so far on Boris’ watch – in public money.She was also given privileged access – not a euphemism – to three official trips that just so happened to be led by one Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson.  Jenner has always insisted Mr Johnson had no influence on this. Maybe one man’s overseas trade mission is another man’s dirty weekend.Oh, paid for with taxpayer’s money, let’s not forget. He seems to have had that one on us. Thrice. The Greater London Authority are conducting an inquiry into Johnson’s conduct.  The vaccine programme in this country is unarguably a triumph. It’s an unlikely, brilliant relief – a huge achievement we didn’t dare to dream of even a few bleak months ago. S’pose it’s not really a surprise that Boris has finally found something he can do, and that it’s sticking things in people. But it does not, cannot, erase the pain, suffering and loss his woeful incompetence has been directly responsible for.The catalogue of mistakes, the infuriating conceit, the carelessness, the poor planning, the apparent shady deals with Tory cronies, the billions of pounds wasted without consequence .Boris Johnson faces an inquiry by the Greater London Authority - responsible for the mayor’s office - over claims his failure to declare his relationship with Arcuri may have been a breach of the Nolan Principles of Public Le, which are contained in the Mayor of London’s code of conduct. Arcuri was granted access to events at three top level trade missions, despite her businesses not meeting the criteria for the trips. The Independent Office for Police Conduct said there was no evidence he’d committed the criminal offence of misconduct in public office but he may have breached the Nolan Principles. Len Duvall, the chair of the GLA oversight committee which is conducting the investigation said: Our investigation will consider whether Boris Johnson conducted himself in a way that’s expected from anyone in that position.It’s important we get those answers, because Londoners deserve to have their politicians held accountable."},{"url":null,"title":"hunt national lottery winner just","story":"NewsHunt for National Lottery winner with just hours to claim £million EuroMillions prizeThe ticket holder of the UK Millionaire Maker jackpot has just hours left to claim the prize - as the six month deadline to claim it runs out very soonmirrorShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _People-Buy-Tickets-For-The-Biggest-Ever-Euro-Millions-Jackpot.jpg\"Ticket holders are being urged to double check their accounts\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Dame Cressida Dick has said despite the gathering on March  in Clapham Common being deemed unlawful by the force, the Duchess of Cambridge was working. However, at the time, Kate had said she had gone in a personal capacity to pay her respects to the -year-old whose body was found days after she went missing while walking home. Speaking on the Today programme this morning, Dame Cressida also said the Met was fully aware beforehand the royal would be in attendance.

Iaposve picked out one that may apply to her but, letaposs be clear, there was a very calm vigil to which she attended where lots and lots of people came. The Commissioner went on to say the Met treated the vigil honouring the tragic -year-old, who died after going missing on a walk home, as an unlawful gathering. She said: It was clearly possible under the law for somebody who lived locally to walk as many did and lay flowers legally, there are other reasons why people might be in the area and they could have laid flowers calmly and peacefully, potentially legally. You would have seen for six hours we did not enforce any laws, we showed some discretion and we allowed people to carry on. Dame Cressida added: We knew that it would result in a mass gathering, we knew there would be large numbers, we knew who would come, we knew it would be unlawful.

Here is everything you need to know. Where can I travel in England  As of March , the “stay at home” order has ended, which means you don’t need a specic reason to leave your home. It has been replaced by a message from the government, asking people to “stay local”. But there has been no guidance to clary what this actually means – whether local means five,  or even  miles from your home. The only guidance that has been given is that people should continue to “minimise travel wherever possible and should not be staying away from home overnight at this stage”.  Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said people should minimise travel, but they can still travel in England to see family and friends. He said: “We’re saying that you should minimise travel butyou want to travel to see friends and family then that’s absolutely fine”. Can I travel to Wales or Scotland  Travel to and from Scotland and Wales is only allowedyou have a “reasonable excuse” – so you can’t just go for a holiday. Scottish guidance reads: “Under current Scottish law, given the state of the epidemic, unless you have a reasonable excuse, you must not travel between Scotland and England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Republic of Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man.” Meanwhile, the Welsh government says: “Currently, travel in to and out of Wales is not permitted unless you have a reasonable excuse. Reasonable excuses include:to meet other people in your support bubble,you have one to escape a risk of illness or injury, such as for victims or people at risk of domestic abuse to provide or receive emergency services to attend a wedding, civil partnership or funeralyou are invited to vote in an election for elite athletes, to train or compete Can I meet family and friends   As of March , outdoor gatherings of either six people, or two households of any size, is allowed. According to the government, this includes both in public spaces and private gardens. So you can meet friends in family in a park, on the beach, or even in someone’s garden – without breaking the rules.

After shocking fans and their own family by announcing their plans to quit in January, the official Megxit date was March . The couple marked the day, which was at the beginning of the Covid pandemic and a week into the UKaposs lockdown, with a goodbye and thank you message on their now defunct Instagram page Sussex Royal. The couple used their social media page to share photos of their charity work and the occasional family photo, however they were forced to close it down when the Queen banned them from using the word aposroyalapos in their branding. Their moving statement spoke about the extraordinarily fragile state of the world and the couple asked fans to take care of themselves and those around them. It also hinted at the non-royal projects they have since announced, by saying were working behind the scenes. They shared a text picture featuring their royal logo, with the words: Thank you to this community for the support, the inspiration and the shared commitment to the good in the world.  The caption read: As we can all feel, the world at this moment seems extraordinarily fragile. Yet we are confident that every human being has the potential and opportunity to make a dference—as seen now across the globe, in our families, our communities and those on the front line—together we can lt each other up to realise the fullness of that promise. What’s most important right now is the health and wellbeing of everyone across the globe and finding solutions for the many issues that have presented themselves as a result of this pandemic. As we all find the part we are to play in this global sht and changing of habits, we are focusing this new chapter to understand how we can best contribute.

TVaposs savviest tycoons invested a record-breaking £. million on new businesses during the latest series - an increase of nearly  per cent on the previous best. Applications to appear on the new series were up by a fth, with  per cent more women appearing and entrepreneurs from a BAME background up by a third. And the stars of the show were in no doubt the pandemic has increased the calibre of wannabe tycoons, who upped their game in terms of appearance, pitch and confidence in front of the experienced business stars. With necessity the mother of invention, pitchers arrived in the Den with a series of pandemic-inspired ideas, including a husband-and-we team with the needs of NHS workers at the heart of their skin care business.  On top of this, a pair of tea entrepreneurs find themselves in hot water when their numbers are interrogated, while an optical inventor catches the eye of the Dragons with his anti-glare glasses. Peter Jones, the last remaining Dragon from the first series in , has invested around £ million during his time on the show. He said: The pandemic has driven a lot of people to look for dferent sources of investment, particularly digital businesses. The quality of the pitches has really gone up a level this year, it really hit me how good they were.  Itaposs been a pretty tough time being in lockdown, but it has given people more time to think and reflect. It felt like the entrepreneurs coming into the den had much more time on their hands to really refine and hone their pitches and think about their businesses, so when the lt doors opened, they were ready. Some of the dragons were offering the entrepreneurs exactly what they asked for, because they were so keen, I wondered what was going on. Dragonsapos Den, now in its th series, has followed Top Gear by moving to BBC One for the first time in its history, with the first episode airing on Thursday at pm.  And new research by Dragonsapos Den to coincide with the new series revealed how the millionaire investors could be braced for an even greater influx of potential entrepreneurs. A survey of , UK adults who donapost currently own their own company revealed one in five think they have what it takes to be a top-level business tycoon. Long-serving Dragon, Deborah Meaden, who has invested almost £ million on show pitchers, added: Itaposs good to see that most of those surveyed understand that running your own business is definitely not  to . If you love it youaposve got to live it. Most also understand the need to be direct and take the tough decisions but the minority who believe itaposs important to be ruthless need to understand tough is dferent to ruthless.  As for the investing after a five minute pitch, well that either takes years of experience, specialist knowledge or more money than sense. The research found one fthwould be multi-tasking magnates, feeling that one business isnapost enough and that they would want to be involved in multiple enterprises. Three quartershave the attitude that when running a business there is no such thing as apos to apos - it is a   activity. More than a quarterthink they would be a ruthless businessperson, while  per cent said they wouldnapost let anything legal stand in their way of making a profit.  There is no time for mincing words for  per cent of respondents, who will tell someone straight awaytheyaposre not interested or happy with them. Almost halfwouldnapost think twice about sacking a friend from their job at their businessthey werenapost performing their job to the required standard. But just  per cent say theyaposd be the sort of person who would be happy to invest personal money in a business after someone gave you a five-minute pitch.

Two green spaces in Nottingham have been shut by the council after huge crowds of people descended on them on Monday and Tuesday in appalling scenes. And in Leeds, London, Manchester, Cardf and dozens of other towns and cities parks were left strewn with discarded food packets, beer tins and smashed glass bottles. People heading to their local park this morning were disgusted to find them in such a state, just three days after Englandaposs nationwide Stay at Home order was lted. Woodhouse Moor in Leeds, West Yorkshire was one of the worst hit today after thousands celebrated the easing of lockdown restrictions and soaked up the sun. Pictures taken today at the scene, in the Hyde Park student area of the city, show enormous amounts of litter left on the grass by many of those in attendance.Has your local park been left looking like a tip after the warm weather this week  Send pictures to webnews@mirrorSophie Meredith, studying for a doctorate in Leeds, said Woodhouse Moor was packed on Tuesday night, predominantly with students, and large amounts of waste such as cans, bottles and boxes were left on Wednesday morning. I walked around the park rather than through it because it was so busy and there wasnapost much or any social distancing going on, the -year-old said.  Itaposs really disgusting that people left their litter piled up by the bins and across the grass, and itaposs an issue that happens every time thereaposs a hot day in Leeds. Today was the worst Iaposve ever seen it. Itaposs probably made worse by the fact that everyoneaposs been cooped up for a year and there are not enough bins in that park. People walking around the Cardf Bay barrage and on Barry Island in Wales on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning were left appalled by the rubbish left behind, which included broken bottles and nappies.  Trash was also left strewn around parks like Pontcanna Fields in Cardf, where crows were seen picking through the debris of the day before.One woman who lives in the Bay told WalesOnline : I live in the centre of Cardf Bay and I am constantly witnessing people publicly urinating on my doorstep, in the car park, outside the shops, it’s disgusting. The amount of rubbish and glass that had been deliberately thrown on the ground is concerning. No thought to how it could affect dogs especially as the glass can stay in their paws. There are also so many families, children and people on bikes who use the area. The Arboretum in Nottingham made headlines on Tuesday when footage surfaced of hundreds of young people leaping in a tight huddle.  Once the last of the joyfully reunited friends had cleared out of the city centre park grew seas of rubbish remained on the grass.Andrew Curzon, , who was jogging through the park this morning, told Nottinghamshire Live : Itaposs an absolute disgrace. Itaposs not hard to take home what you brought.Itaposs a real blight on the city and weaposre being let down by selfish people. I donapost have a problem with people meeting in groups but I wonapost stand for the mess and littering. Where has the respect gone   City council leader councillor David Mellen said the decision has now been made to close the Arboretum along with Lenton Recreation Ground. We have taken steps to prevent a repeat of the appalling scenes we witnessed at the Arboretum on Monday evening, he said. We regret having to take this action, since everyone has been looking forward to the chance to visit our parks, now that easing of restrictions means we can meet up to six other people outdoors. Sadly, the actions of a thoughtless minority has spoilt that. We will keep the situation under review and hope to reopen parks as soon as possible. Meanwhile in Liverpoolaposs Sefton Park mountains of bottles and cans were heaped near rubbish bins while patches of grass were left burnt by disposable barbecues, while footage showed Londonaposs Hyde Park similarly littered on Wednesday. Manchesteraposs Platt Fields Park and Cutting Room Square were also left in a sorry state, with boxes of alcohol and empty laughing gas canisters scattered liberally on the floor. One furious resident told Manchester Evening News that she had spotted people defecating at the back of houses near Platt Fields.  Students and young locals treat it like a Parkle event, she said. As soon as the sun comes out, because there are no bars, restaurants or pubs open due to the lockdown, they all flock to the park. When the alcohol is flowing and there are no facilities open they are using the back of peopleaposs houses to urinate and defecate. This is outrageous as it is against the law to do this in a public place.  Primrose Hill in Regentaposs Park London was covered in litter this morning- leaving one dog walker disgusted. The -year-old, who lives in north London, said: aposaposI get it we’ve all been banged up indoors and the sun was shining. aposaposBut you’ve got to be really selfish to not pick up your own rubbish and take it with you. In the North East Tynemouth Longsands was hit hard by litter louts who had headed to the coast on what was the hottest March day in years.  This morning the beach was covered in beer bottles, cans and plastic bags. The chaotic scenes yesterday and resulting mess have led to big clear up efforts this morning. In Birmingham, council teams suspended mowing across parks today so they could focus on litter picking instead.  A council crew arrived at Woodhouse Moor early this morning to begin the clean-up operation and are expected to remain in place well into the afternoon. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick urged people to make the most of the latest easing of lockdown restrictions in England in a sensible, cautiousapos manner, enjoying the sunshine but also being careful and sticking to the rules. He told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain: Weaposve all waited a long time to meet family and friends outdoors with these very limited freedoms we have now.

Angry pupils walked out of Pimlico Academy in Westminster, central London this morning - the last day of term - in protest against the schoolaposs hierarchy. The students, who chanted we want change, are campaigning for the schoolaposs unorm policy and history curriculum to be reversed amid claims of discrimination. Head teacher Daniel Smith ushered in a unorm policy last year which stated hairstyles that block the view of others would not be allowed and hijabs should not be too colourful. It has now emerged that members of the National Education Unionat the school overwhelmingly passed a motion of no confidence in the head teacher on Tuesday evening.Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror.An NEU spokeswoman added that the decision had also been made to move towards a ballot for industrial action, with an indicative ballot scheduled for after Easter. Pauline Buchanan, NEU London regional secretary, said: Members have not taken this decision lightly. This vote is in response to serious failures of management which members believe are bringing the school into disrepute. As well as NEU membersapos trade dispute over the industrial issues, members have strongly expressed their solidarity with studentsapos concerns and their desire for an anti-racist school.  A statement purportedly on behalf of students railed against racism, Islamophobia and transphobia and said pupils were angry at a lack of recognition of the Black Lives Matter movement. Parents Dee, Sham and Layla, who all have a child in Year  and declined to give their surnames, said studentsapos complaints centred around a race issue. Pupils have also claimed that there has been no recognition of Black Lives Matter or Black History Month, and that concerns about the placement of the Union Jack flag have been repeatedly ignored. Speaking after students had been sent home for the day, Dee told the PA news agency: The main problem is when the new headteacher came along he changed a lot of the rules, mainly to do with their appearance. So like their hair and their head scarves... as in they shouldnapost have a hairdo that can block the view of others. She claimed this was basically talking about Afro hair.

The mother who gave her name as Sham said: They tried a lot with the school .. .but their voices werenapost getting heard and this is why it reached this. I think the headteacher just needs to come down to our level and listen. But he was actually hiding. Mr Smith took over as principal at the school last September, the NEU said. The entire senior leadership team at the school has since resigned, the union added. A member of staff speaking outside the school told PA the enforcement and strictness of recent rule changes had caused some teachers to feel undermined.  The staff member, who did not give her name, said students felt the unorm policy was racially discriminating in that it targeted particular groups in the school such as those wearing a head dress or those with Afros. Our feeling as staff is that we really support what the kids have done, she added. Future Academies, which runs the school, said in a statement: This morning Pimlico Academy saw a protest by some students.

A disturbing picture shows young children confined in a giant pod after fleeing from Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security facility in Donna, Texas, is holding , migrants, most unaccompanied minors. The Biden administration allowed several reporters to interview border officials and tour the crowded facility following growing demands for more access. Officer Oscar Escamilla said at least , unaccompanied children have been held longer than the legal limit of  hours.  Of those,  have been stuck in the tent facility for more than  days awaiting places in a shelter overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services. “It’s out of my hands,” he told reporters. “For whatever reason, they have fallen through the system or through the cracks.” The sharp rise in arrivals is being driven by poor economic conditions, effects of hurricanes, and hope among migrants they will be able to stay as President Biden eases immigration policies. The number of immigrant families apprehended by US agents along the southern border nearly tripled in February from a month earlier to about , people.  Hunger and poverty are spurring their flight. So is disinformation that has rocketed across social media and by word of mouth that the US border is now wide open.Reuters interviewed nearly two dozen migrants and more than a dozen people identying themselves as smugglers, and examined hundreds of posts in closed Facebook groups where these “coyotes” advertise their services. The review revealed pervasive myths about immigration policy changes under U.S. President Joe Biden.“There’s  days of free passage across the border,” a Guatemalan smuggler told Reuters.  The truth is much more complex.U.S. Customs and Border Protectioncontinues to enforce a policy, implemented by former President Donald Trump one year ago, of ing most southern-border crossers to Mexico.About , people, or % of such migrants - mostly single adults - were rapidly deported in February alone, according to CBP data. Some of those people were likely repeat crossers as the reciism rate has climbed in the past year, according to U.S. officials. “Don’t come over,” Biden said in a March  interview with ABC News when asked to articulate his message to hopefuls. “Don’t leave your town or city or community.” Still, it’s true that more migrants - mainly children and families - have been allowed to enter the United States in the early days of his administration than in the final days of Trump’s. In February, more than half of the family members caught with children at the border were not expelled. Many have been released from CBP custody into the United States as they await asylum hearings.

the music they all listened and danced to back in their teenage years.“Evenings at the local dance hall, memories sparked by pieces of music and then the long walk home for the men sparked infectious laughter.“The ladies remembered ‘stfening’ their petticoats with sugar and water to make them stick out more by way of ‘preening’ themselves for the night ahead!”While Elvis Presley was the big favourite in the s, many recalled having posters on their walls with the likes of Bobby Vee, Connie Francis and Neil Sedaka.In the s, the British groups took over and The Beatles, the Dave Clark Five and The Rolling Stones were equally hugely popular in America.Lorraine said: “It was fabulous to see people from either side of the pond singing along, word perfect, to the music.”The early sessions have also featured recollections of the high-pitched welcome from the crowd at Beatles performances in Dundee’s Caird Hall.#You could barely hear for the screaming#: Remembering the first time the Beatles played Dundee\" title\"##You could barely hear for the screaming#: Remembering the first time the Beatles played Dundee# #

Fair play to them for that.They were the better team after going two down and the rest of the game was actually a really good performance.The defending will still be worrying McPake and the coaching staff but the fact they’ve dug deep, battled and have found a decent balance will please them.They create a lot of chances and cause teams problems.Lee Ashcroft is flying right now and looking really dangerous at every set-piece, Danny Mullen added a spark and both wingers, Paul McMullan and Declan McDaid, were excellent.Long may it continue.We’ve seen in the past how success in cup competitions can spur on a club like Dundee United.With little left to play for in the Premiership, putting a lot of focus and importance on having a good run in the Scottish Cup could benefit the Terrors in the long run.I know that’s what happened in my time at the club when we made the  League Cup Final and then won the Scottish in .The club then had a successful period off the back of that, regularly making the top six, European football and contesting big semi-final and final clashes.That’s, obviously, where the Tangerines want to be again in the future.For the here and now, though, the focus has to be on dealing with Partick Thistle.When the League One Jags come to Tannadice on Saturday, United will be in the unusual position of being huge favourites.It’s not something they’ll have been used to in recent times after ing to the top flight this season but I’m sure boss Micky Mellon will have them well prepared.They struggled in the Betfred Cup group stages earlier in the season, particularly when they lost to Peterhead, when they were in that strange position of being the favourites.They’re a dferent team now, though. They look a lot more confident and,they play like we know they can, they’ll have no problems.Despite two draws to open their World Cup qualying campaign, I still feel Scotland have it all to play forthey can get big results.It was going to be a tough ask from day one, and not winning in Israel on Sunday night doesn’t help the situation, because you can see how tight the group is going to be.Denmark and Austria are, obviously, good teams and Israel, credit to them, are a decent side.They showed that in the first half in Tel-Aviv in the - ide.I do, however, feel Scotland made them look better than they are and showed a little too much respect.We sat off and can’t do that again.SCOTLAND ANALYSIS: The aggression has gone, get Allan McGregor in for the Euros and World Cup hopes are hanging by a thread\" title\"#SCOTLAND ANALYSIS: The aggression has gone, get Allan McGregor in for the Euros and World Cup hopes are hanging by a thread# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football international  scotland-world-cup-steve-clarke-allan-mcgregor embed # secretmeXxqLMc\" data-secret\"meXxqLMc\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"brush-britains-marilyn-dream-come-true-glasgow-teen","story":"IT IS no wonder teenage boy Iain Henderson thought he was dreaming back in Glasgow in ."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-reverend-effie-irvine-pioneering-woman-minister-made-scottish-history","story":" Reverend Effie Irvine made history when she became the first woman minister appointed to a parish in Scotland.

hailed the city council’s “approach to thinking big” over its plans for a new stadium at the beach.Earlier this year the Evening Express revealed the Dons were in talks with Aberdeen City Council over whether to potentially scrap its new ground at Kingsford and remain close to its historic home of Pittodrie.At the beginning of March, the local authority included a new stadium as part of plans for a £ million regeneration of the city centre and beach area.Planning permission for the Kingsford site was granted in  and although a training ground opened there the following year, work on the stadium stalled because of the Covid- pandemic.And the club said earlier this year it was open to the prospect of rethinking its plans.In a live QA session with supporters, Mr Cormack said: “We have a fantastic natural asset at the beach. I commend the council for developing TECA [PJ Live], which will be a real asset to the economy when we come out of this [pandemic].“A similar approach to thinking big for the beach renovation is to be applauded as well.“From a club perspective, we welcome Aberdeen City Council’s recognition of our major role within the community and our contribution to the local economy, as evidenced by its proposals for the new stadium to be part of this regeneration of the beach area.“As a club we are keen, along with other stakeholders, to see what part we can play in this.“It’s important to stress that the site at the beach was not available to us when we sought planning permission for Kingsford.”A possible site for the new stadium is the site of the Doubletree Hotel, which closed last year amid the Covid- pandemic.The complex could also include a leisure centre and a new home for extreme sports centre Transition.Mr Cormack added the club may consider a share or bond issue to help fund a new ground, while further funding could also come from the council.Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said: “It’s good to hear Aberdeen Football Club are thinking the same way as us and are thinking big about the regeneration of the beach area.“We will carry on talking to the club to seewe can put something together that suits both parties and keeps the football club down in the beach area.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58922352-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58922352-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58922352-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58922352-1-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"boss of aberdeen john lewis says stakes are very high and very real in letter to shoppers devastated by closure plans","story":"Andrew Murphy, partner and executive director of operations, John Lewis Partnership, writes an open letter to Evening Express readers.

These efforts will inform the proposals for discussion with John Lewis on Tuesday.”John Lewis announced last week that it is considering the permanent closure of its city store – with around  workers expected to lose their jobs.A petition to keep the store has reached nearly , signatures although John Lewis has said a final decision on the store has yet to be made.Meanwhile, a member of John Lewis staff has said they are “gutted” that the city centre store may not open its doors again.In a letter written to the Evening Express, Eleanor Heptinstall said she hopes bosses can find a way to give the department store’s George Street premises a future.She said: “I am a partner at the John Lewis Aberdeen store –we are all gutted that our store may not open again.“John Lewis Aberdeen plays a key role in attracting shoppers from Aberdeenshire, Inverness, the Highlands  Islands and even Norway to Aberdeen.“Our presence, in turn, assists small businesses, the local hospitality and leisure industries and communities in Aberdeenshire.“I myself moved to Aberdeen to study, as I used to work at Waitrose. What attracted me was being able to move within the John Lewis Partnership, to Aberdeen to assist me through university.“Many students look for a richness in academic quality, shopping destinations, leisure and cultural activities when looking for a suitable university.”“We all hope that the JLP executives change their minds, butnot, we hope we have left a lasting legacy to Aberdeen and that the city revitalises.”Jamie Wishart, head of branch for John Lewis Aberdeen, said: “Our store has been at the heart of the city since , with generations of partners serving our customers in Aberdeen with pride and passion.“I know, having talked to many of our customers over my time here, how dearly loved our shop is and how disappointing news of the proposed closure will be. I would like to thank them for all their support and loyalty.”John Lewis has been a stalwart store in Aberdeen’s city centre since it opened its doors in .With its distinctive, stepped concrete exterior, the branch on George Street has been a popular shopping destination for more than three decades.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/EE-DB-20112020-01-008_37009505-556x372.jpg ","title":"save our stores readers letters special on plans to close aberdeens john lewis","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remNews of John Lewis# plans to close the Aberdeen store has prompted a flood of readers# letters.What do you think of the decision to close Aberdeen’s John Lewis  Have your say here ee.letters@ajl Sir, – When I moved to the north-east of Scotland more than  years ago, I was delighted to discover that Aberdeen has a John Lewis. Since then the shop on George Street has been my go-to place for quality clothing, homewares, electricals and much more. The customer service is excellent and staff are friendly, competent and very helpful.With the end of lockdown in sight I was really looking forward to a real le shopping trip to John Lewis for some much-needed clothing.Buying clothes online doesn’t do anything for me. I need to see the stuff, feel its quality and try it on – and then enjoy the satisfaction of carrying it home.I’m confident that I’m not alone in this. I also won’t be alone in my disbelief that the last remaining department store in the whole north and north-east of Scotland is going to be taken away from the people who live in the region.Above all my heart goes out to the  staff, and the staff of the seven other John Lewis stores earmarked for closure, who now have to fear for their jobs.The Aberdeen store was once described as successful. After lockdown ends shoppers, allowed and keen to leave their homes again, will .Please, John Lewis Partnership, can you grant your Aberdeen store a grace period until the economy has recovered post-Covid Regina Erich, Willow Row, Stonehaven.Sir, – I am devastated at the news that John Lewis is to close. It is my favourite shop. They fitted my lovely new kitchen in  and were so efficient. I buy my electricals there and other things.It will be a huge loss to the cityit closes. Please plead with them to reconsider.V C Holroyd, Peterculter.Sir, – I was shocked yesterday to hear about the proposed closing of the Aberdeen branch of John Lewis. It would be a devastating loss to the whole area and to Aberdeen city centre in particular.I very much appreciate the goods and services they have provided over the years. I was last in the store just before the Boxing Day closure and cannot imagine our city centre without it.Joyce Plenderleith.Sir, – Whenever I am in town and on George Street I normally visit John Lewis then I might venture to some of the other shops in the area.The same goes vice versa.If in another shop I normally look into John Lewis too. So what I am saying is that this will have a very big effect on the smaller shops in George Street.Donald McPherson, Bucksburn.Sir, – With the closure of John Lewis, the Aberdeen City Council might just as well close the city! There is no reason for visitors or residents north of the central belt to come here any more.With the crippling business rates, the council has overseen the demise of the city.Union Street used to be a lovely street on which to shop, but in the last few years it has deteriorated into an eyesore.Mary Skelton, Inchmarlo, Banchory.Sir, – I was very disappointed to hear of the intended closure of the John Lewis store in Aberdeen.I have been a customer of the store over many years and will miss the knowledgeable, helpful and pleasant staff especially in the electrical and domestic appliances departments – this being more of an issue in Aberdeen as there is now little choice of store where you can get such help and shopping online does not allow for gaining the personal knowledge of the staff.Furthermore with the closure of so many department stores in Aberdeen this would be yet another blow to residents of Aberdeen and the surrounding area.Jacqueline Henderson.Sir, – Like everyone, I was very shocked, saddened and angry at the news that the Aberdeen branch was to close its doors.The impact of this pandemic has been without doubt catastrophic for so many and extremely challenging to say the least. Aberdeen is a wonderful city but to be deprived of its last department store just doesn’t bear thinking about.Whilst online sales are booming, and I certainly do a fair share of my shopping in this way, nothing beats the experience of going into a store to actually see the products and there are plenty of people, particularly an older generation who do not use the internet, and their only option is to have the experience of a day out to the shops.There’s no doubt changes need to be made in many of these large department stores andthey are to try and keep up with the demands of online, they need to make it a really enjoyable shopping experience. John Lewis certainly could do with an overhaul, introduce more interesting brands rather than duplicate ones within their store that were already in standalone stores a stone’s throw away.Their restaurant on the top floor was not the best and did not deliver a high quality of food but could easily replicate the likes of Harvey Nichols, Selfridges or Harrods and introduce branded restaurants into the store, have a champagne drinks bar in another area, offer Prosecco with a manicure pedicure, great tea room with cakes and really just offer a similar experience albeit on a much smaller scale.The question that baffled many people was why Waitrose didn’t go ahead as that would have been a guaranteed success.Plenty to think about but meantime I sincerely hope that something can be doneto save our Aberdeen store and the jobs of all their wonderful staff.Julie Lefevre.Sir, – Yesterday I learned from your web page the sad news of the closure, which prompted me to email the store to ascertain the facts and to explain my disappointment.We have been supporters of John Lewis since the s, from my home city of Nottingham and finally to Aberdeen via London and we have, like many in the last  months, had to resort to online with the intention of ing to the store once le s to normal.The closure of this iconic store in the north-east of Scotland will have an impact on our purchasing as after normality it will not be to John Lewis online but to local retailers we will turn to.The reason is obvious as many products are best bought by sight and touch, coupled with product knowledge. Electrical products from lighting to freezers, clothing, where s become a burden when colours and texture don’t meet expectation, crockery, linen, tableware and cosmetics just to name a few.John Lewis management why did you not give us a chance toto the store before you axed it John Burrows, Pannanich Road, Ballater.Sir, – This is first time ever I have written to a newspaper – I cannot begin to express the devastation I feel at the loss of the John Lewis store.It opened when I was expecting my son and presents for all le’s celebrations, birthdays and Christmas have been purchased there.My -year-old mum died four weeks ago and my last outing with her was to John Lewis so she could buy Christmas gts and have a cuppa and a scone. Can Aberdeen council not be encouraged to provide financial support to this instead of wooden benches on Union Street This will be the nail in the coffin for Aberdeen city centre – please use your social media powers to get all behind this.Anne Boyd.Sir, – For years now shop staff have followed managerial guidelines to inform customers they’d get a better selection of lines online.Too many times have I been told that and replied they were providing nails for their coffin.Seems they have followed guidelines so far now that customers are using the internet to shop as instructed – and look at the high street downfall!Paul Collier, Scott Grove, Belhelvie, Aberdeen.Sir, – Where are our leaders  Are they hiding hoping that everything will blow over and no one will notice their lack of motivation I think so.They are still employed and receiving a wage. The money generated by John Lewis is pivotal in the economy of the city.Do they really think by hiding their heads in the sand that no one will notice their lack of leadership I don’t think so.They should be ashamed by their lack of action. Poor, poor aberdeen what a wonderful city it was.Anne Gibson.Sir, – The closure is a disaster. Along with the loss of Debenhams many of us have lost the opportunity to go to shops where,we are looking for a ‘special’ or just really nice outfit, we had a large range of styles, names and prices to look at, judge the quality of and try on.As we get older we do not have the confidence of the young to shop online for important items. We want to know we can go into a shop, browse and hopefully come out with what we want.As well as that we could have a day out in John Lewis with its massive range of goods and food areas.I cannot believe that there is no longer a single department store in Aberdeen and its greater area. It is so very disappointing.M A Farquharson.Sir, – I completely agree that the loss of John Lewis would be a real death nail to the city centre. We all hear that online shopping has killed the high street but other retailers like Primark are hugely successful without an online presence.I therefore suggest that it is not the case that people only want to shop online. The city centre of Aberdeen has seen a lack of investment for some time.It has not been helped by crippling cuts the city council has had to make due to huge underfunding by the Scottish Government. Business rates directly set by the Scottish Government have been an enormous challenge for business and has driven many previously successful businesses from the city.Karen Shirreffs.Sir, – This is the only department store left in Aberdeen and to close this is the end of our city centre.Helen Madigan.Sir, – Unfortunately the writing has been on the wall for the John Lewis store in Aberdeen’s George Street long before the pandemic came along.And like many other people who would like to save this retail store, the reality is that even more people are doing most of their shopping online because it is safer and more convenient andthe footfall vanishes from a retail store it is unlikely toto the levels of  or  years ago.When chain stores such as Debenhams and John Lewis are no longer viable then they just have to accept the reality and close down loss-making stores and compete online with the rest of the sector.It is a great shame for the hundreds of staff who will lose their jobs at the John Lewis store here in Aberdeen but even with a petition of ,+ signatures, including my own, it is unlikely to change the minds of their directors and management staff.Brian McLeod.Sir, – Though I was half expecting John Lewis Aberdeen to stop trading, it seems like the final nail in the coffin for Aberdeen.I have been a great supporter of the store since its inception being a member of the generation who did the shops every Saturday. Soon it will just be a memory along with EM’s, Falconer’s, Watt and Grant’s and other noble institutions.As a place to visit Aberdeen has been in decline since the s due to poor planning and council leadership.Keeping John Lewis open may just be the start of an upward surge in the retail sector.Liz Jamieson.Sir, – The news of the planned closure of the John Lewis Aberdeen store is devastating, not only for Aberdeen but for the whole of the north of Scotland.It means that there will be no department stores north of the central belt. Yet there will be two John Lewis stores within  miles of each other.Obviously the company will have committed large sums of money to the new store in Edinburgh but one wonders how much they have looked at the impact of the closure of the Debenhams stores in Aberdeen, Dundee and Inverness. It would have left them with a monopoly in the rest of Scotland, the often forgotten part of Scotland, lying outwith the central belt.The news is very disappointing and I will think hard before shopping with John Lewis online or in their remaining stores.There are other online options out there. Hopefully they will reconsider.Jill Miller.Sir, – The proposed closure of John Lewis in Aberdeen seems to be the end-game as far as this city is concerned.From once being a vibrant and busy centre, it has now become a rundown eyesore without any attraction whatsoever, and with the only true department store gone in Aberdeen, the city is slowly dying.From being a city which is richer now than in the s, I cannot understand how successive councils have allowed such deterioration to occur, other than having demanded totally unreasonable monies in rents which clearly is one of the major reasons the city centre is as it is today.If we are to avoid being reduced to a backwater, the council has to start thinking seriously about how to regenerate a city we can be proud of. And the first step is to persuade John Lewis to stay.Patricia Karlstad.Sir, – We now find another major store is pulling out of the city due mainly to lack of support from the community.It may be hard for some to accept this butyou do not support the local stores then they will not run at a loss just to remain in town.Over the years Aberdeen has been slowly declining due to lack of investment. The city council lack experience in attracting businesses to the city.They do not have the foresight to develop a strategy for recovery.Look down south at Newcastle after the demise of the shipyards and coal mining, they turned the local economy around.I appreciate they have in place projects such as Union Terrace Gardens but this will be another white elephant. The council needs to look around at the conditions in the city.We are no longer the oil capital of Europe, those days are long gone.A Riddel, Bridge of Don, Aberdeen.Sir, – John Lewis must stay open.This store has ious departments selling items not available in any other store in the city.If it closes it will also limit our choice for ious products such as electronic equipment, technical items, white goods and so on leaving only one other outlet with the monopoly for these items.These items can be bought online but I personally, like many others, like to see the items I am interested in.It would be a very sad day and a massive loss to the Aberdeen and surrounding communities.Helen Stevenson, Westhill, Aberdeenshire.Sir, – Aberdeen city centre has been dealt yet another disastrous retail blow with the announcement of the closure of the John Lewis store leaving many retail workers nowlooking for alternative retail work where closures are now sadly frequent.There is little doubt that online sales are increasing and encouraged by the Covid- pandemic but high rents and commercial rates have also taken their toll on major retail stores.Aberdeen is suffering this ongoing collapse in retail outlets as are all cities in Scotland but there needs to be a complete rethink of how commercial rates in Scotland have escalated to unaffordable levels and what alternatives need to be considered related to profits rather than property values.Dennis Forbes Grattan, Mugiemoss Road, Bucksburn.Sir, – Here is an idea, clear out the ground floor and install a Waitrose.

Can we be successful in working with John Lewis to convince them to change their minds #Maybe not, butwe do nothing, we already know the outcome.#Special: Your thoughts on the plans to close John LewisCustomers could face six-hour round trip to #nearest store#Aberdeen branch shutsClosure of Illicit Still rubs #salt in the wound# of John Lewis#s planned departureLetter from the editor: Now is the time to make your voice heard and save our city centre tooThe John Lewis Partnership has said it will listen to proposals put forward by city leaders and politicians in an “appropriate consultation process”.A spokeswoman added it was “too early” to discuss details on any plans but said the firm was “actively having conversations with Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce, stakeholders and local politicians”.SNP candidate for Aberdeen Central, Kevin Stewart, also took part in talks with John Lewis management and called for the new taskforce to work to “ensure all opportunities” have been assessed.The proposals are understood to include a new retail space where in the city centre and the potential for a Waitrose supermarket to be added to the George Street space to increase footfall.Mr Stewart said: “The Scottish Government stand ready to assist in terms of redundancies, but as a city, we need to come together and put in place a credible, and politically neutral, taskforce to put everything on the table and ensure all opportunities have been assessed.#New figures show Aberdeen city centre footfall has fallen by more than % during the pandemic, while % of sales at John Lewis have shted online.Adrian Watson, the chief executive of business development group Aberdeen Inspired, said city leaders were “still fighting” to keep the high street giant.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden added: “Everyone needs do everything they can to get John Lewis to overturn this decision – I think it’s quite short sighted.“On Tuesday we had the huge announcement from the UK Government on the £ billion investment into the energy sector and the £ million that we’ve committed to the city centre and beach regeneration.“I would have liked to see John Lewis open the store again and seesome of these things would have an impact on the store.“You would like to think that our local economy will bounce back because of that investment.“But it’s clear from what John Lewis said that they are only really interested in the online market in the north-east, and that is regrettable and something we really need to keep on at them to seethey’ll change their mind.”For as

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

If you have a sporting collection, no matter what size or sport, please do get in touch.#It is hoped the project will also support Scotland’s sporting collections to be better understood and help identy the role sport plays in wider issues around health and wellbeing.The research is being conducted by archive specialists Turnstone Consultancy.Research lead Kat Petersen added: #Sporting heritage might be tidily boxed up in an archive or accumulating in a cupboard in your office or clubhouse. However it is being stored or displayed,you have any records or objects relating to sports in Scotland we would love to hear from you.#If anyone is aware of any sporting collections which may be of interest, or at risk in some way, an online survey is available for completion.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence. That’s an unnecessary distraction.We need a needle-sharp focus on the recovery without the distraction of another isive referendum.Put recovery first.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the Argyll and Bute LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary election"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures march 5 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day.

Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location.

Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In  my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died. Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#.

Signicant preparatory work was, however, undertaken.The roads reconstruction programme aims to arrest the rate of decline and provide an overall improvement in condition.The success of this approach has been demonstrated in recent years through independent evaluation, as outlined in the annual status and options report.Councillor Rory Colville, policy lead for roads and infrastructure services, said: #This is a signicant investment and recognises the vital role that transport and travel will play in Argyll and Bute’s post-Covid recovery.#The overall budget is ided on the basis of the surface area of the road network within each council area.In line with this, projects in the Mid Argyll and Tarbert area will benefit to the tune of £, from the additional cash, for road improvements around Kilmartin, in Furnace village and at Glenralloch, Tarbert."},{"url":null,"title":"approaching two thirds vaccinated in argyll and bute","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In this instalment, we spoke to Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross.Q. What is your party planning to do for the Borders, in particular A. We are very keen to see voices across Scotland heard, because I think after the last  years of the SNP being in charge we have seen decisions taken that suit the central belt of Scotland, but not the south of Scotland.Areas such as Peeblesshire have largely been ignored. I said when I became leader of the Scottish Conservatives, probably because I represent an area outwith the central belt, I want to make sure that the voices of communities that havenrsquot been heard are finally heard in the Scottish Parliament.With a local candidate like Shona Haslam, we have got an excellent local advocate who is passionate about the local community, who will drive for more local services to be delivered locally and more investment for local communities.I have done a lot about ensuring carer funding for local authorities, recruiting new teachers right across the country, investing in businesses to protect peoplersquos jobs and I think as we come out of this pandemic, itrsquos really important that the focus of the Scottish Parliament and every MSP is on recovery and rebuilding after the most dficult  months we have had ndash rather than the SNPrsquos plans for another referendum.Q. We have run stories about local businesses being hurt by the impact of Brexit. What assurances can you give them A. I donrsquot underestimate the challenge that businesses have faced and those who have raised concerns directly with me, I have treated them really seriously and wersquove got to resolve them.I welcome the fact that there was a compensation scheme, particularly for fishing.The pound million was important, but I said at the time that wonrsquot be enoughwe still have the underlying problems with added bureaucracy and delays in getting produce out to Europe.From the conversations I have had, there have been improvements, but there are still challenges that we have got to navigate.Thatrsquos why Lord Frost has been appointed to look at these issues in detail and get them resolved so we can have a far smoother process.That means reducing the number andof forms, the bureaucracy that there is and allowing businesses to do what they do best which is getting our great produce out and into the European Union market.Q. Scottish Borders Council has declared a climate emergency. What are the Scottish Conservatives doing in terms of the climate A. I think the climate  the environment  the green agenda will go through all partiesrsquo manestos over the next few weeks, because the UK is hosting the COP conference in Glasgow.Itrsquos a real opportunity for us to showcase to the whole world the s Scotland has gone to with renewable energy and the progress wersquove made in terms of development of new, renewable technologies and the investment we can make. We saw the budget a couple of weeks ago put in considerable investment.I think it was pound million into the north east for a transition from the traditional oil and gas into a green transition.Itrsquos important that we recognise the environment as a key issue in this election, for particularly young people, but voters of all ages and thatrsquos why the green agenda will be woven through our partyrsquos manesto and itrsquos a top priority for us going into these elections.Q. Why do you think your party, traditionally, hasnrsquot been as successful in Scotland as it has in England A. If you just look at the last few election campaigns, we have made signicant gains. In the  election we more than doubled the number of our MSPs and it was because the Scottish Conservatives more than doubled in size that we prevented the SNP from getting a majority and prevented them holding another independence referendum.Itrsquos absolutely clearwersquore to stop the SNP again, only by using votes for the Scottish Conservatives can people be assured of that outcome.We have made progress at every election in recent years, both at Holyrood, Westminster and local authorities and we are clearly the strongest challengers to the SNP right across the country.I donrsquot put a limit on my ambitions for the party. Wersquove got great local candidates like Shona [Haslam] and great representatives like David Mundell. People can see that the Conservatives deliver for the communities they represent.Readersrsquo questions Q. If everyone apart from you voted for the SNP, would you still refuse to back another independence referendum A. I am a Scottish Conservative and Unionist, so I will never support another independence referendum. I think the ision that caused in our country in  is still in our society right now. Itrsquos damaging.But we are still dealing with a global pandemic and we will be dealing with the effects of COVID- on our economy for years to come.It is the height of irresponsibility for the SNP to say they are going to push ahead with another independence referendum, rather than focus on our recovery rebuilding as a country and mending the ision that has distracted Scotland for so long.Q. What is your opinion of the allegations of lsquochumocracyrsquo over the awarding of PPE contracts by the UK Conservative government A. These things are all investigated by the Public Accounts Committee in the UK Parliament, which is chaired by a member of the opposition who will look into these details.The Cabinet Office will also look into it. I think overall wersquove got to look at how the country responded to COVID- and in terms of getting PPE into the country at a vital time and ensuring our NHS is not overwhelmed when we saw other countries in Europe such as Spain and Italy seeing their NHS overwhelmed.Wersquove seen an outstanding roll-out of the vaccination programme. Thatrsquos only been possible here in Scotland because the UK Government procured and developed vaccines at an early stage in the pandemic.And wersquove seen the support in terms of the furlough scheme to protect almost one million jobs in Scotland, the support for self-employed, and the support for businesses.All that has been possible because of the strength of the United Kingdom. Thatrsquos the area that most people focus on in terms of the COVID pandemic with me ndash just how we have all worked together during the most dficult  months where the sacrices people have made wouldrsquove been unimaginable a year ago.I think we can see light at the end of the tunnel and one day this will all be a very bad and distant memory.Q. As a Westminster MP, why are you calling for a vote of no confidence in the leader of another parliament [Nicola Sturgeon], when the UKrsquos [Conservative] home secretary has broken the ministerial code and the health secretary has acted unlawfully *Please note: Our interview with Mr Ross took place on Friday, March . Since then, a vote of no confidence in Ms Sturgeon has been held ndash it failed by - .

Welcoming the reportrsquos findings, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoMr Hamilton has considered all of the allegations against me, and I am happy that his reportrsquos findings clear me of any breach of the ministerial code.A. Because I am the leader of the main opposition party in Scotland and itrsquos the role of the leader of the opposition party to scrutinise the conduct of the Scottish Government, ministers and First Minister.We have seen in the evidence to the parliamentary enquiry that Nicola Sturgeon has breached the ministerial code, she has misled parliament and there is no way anyone can continue as First Minister having misled parliament.Itrsquos my role as leader of the main opposition party to highlight that and I believe there is a strong case that Nicola Sturgeon should resign."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-peeblesshire-test-sites-operate-next-week","story":"THREE places in Peeblesshire will be among the next Borders sites offering tests to people without coronavirus symptoms.On March , NHS Borders announced that new community testing centres would be rolled out across the region.And on Tuesday , the health board revealed that fire stations in Peebles, Innerleithenand West Lintonwill be offering tests next week.:Heroin offences: Peebles man sentenced after admitting pair of drugs crimesNHS Bordersrsquo director of public health, Dr Tim Patterson, said: ldquoThe more we know about COVID-and where it currently is the better able we will be to contain it and limit its spread throughout our communities.ldquoAlthough cases in the Borders are low at present, there are still cases out there.

However, health experts are warning the pandemic is far from over there, with cases likely to pick upcurbs were lted too soon.Passengers will be asked to wear face masks on Ryanair flights potentially until , the airlinersquos boss has said, as he announced ato a more normal summer schedule.The budget airline plans to run around , flights every day during the summer this year, Michael OrsquoLeary said.ldquoI would imagine at this point in time, wersquore planning to continue to require mandatory face mask wearing on board our aircraft through the remainder of this summer schedule and next winterrsquos schedule, Mr OrsquoLeary said.According to the Scottish Governmentrsquos website, ldquoin all levels and settings, we should follow ldquoadvice and requirements such as on the use of face coverings.Speaking on March  when she outlined Scotlandrsquos route map out of the pandemic, the First Minister said that it is ldquohoped that we could reach ldquoat least Level  by the end of June.Currently, guidance under Level  includes the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport and shops ndash unless you are exempt.However, Ms Sturgeon said that ldquowe hope we will be able to get beyond even that, with a ldquoview to restoring as much normality as possible.Wersquove shared our timeline for a safe and gradual easing of restrictions in Scotland.All dates are dependent on scientic evidence that it is safe to ease further.Watch our video to find out more ##Read the timeline ## https:t.co XabMrdBXjt pic QoVbuyaXVShe told MSPs: ldquoIt is our fervent hope - and also our tentatively increasing expectation - that vaccination, continued and effective use of the test and protect system, and probably a continued compliance with precautions like good hand hygiene, will allow us to keep Covid under much greater control.ldquoAnd that this will allow us to enjoy many of the things that we took for granted before the pandemic ndash for example, normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs.She said that she is ldquooptimistic this date will be over the summer, adding ldquohopefully something closer to actual normality, with the ability to hug those we love, will become possible.From this, we can establish that the wearing of face coverings is likely to be in place for some time yet.The First Minister has pointed towards ldquoactual normality by some point in the summer, suggesting thatthe science backs things up, there could be a potential relaxation of the rules around masks.However,we look towards the decisions being made in Australia, the levels of cases may need to get to extremely low levels for this to take place."},{"url":null,"title":"plea-owners-dogs-disturbing-birds-levenhall-links-nature-reserve","story":"Posters have been put up at Levenhall Links in support of the Responsible Dog Ownership Campaign, launched by the Scottish Government in partnership with the Scottish SPCA.The initiative seeks to remind dog owners that they have a legal responsibility to keep their dog under proper control in order to prevent and reduce the risk of incidents.The posterswere put up at the nature attraction ndash which once hosted RSPB Scotlandrsquos Big Nature Festival ndash by East Lothian Councilrsquos countryside rangers, who are also targeting other sites in the county.A council spokeswoman said that, as the weather improved, the days ened and people exercised outdoors, it was appropriate to remind dog walkers to keep dogs under control.She said: ldquoAt this time of year in countryside sites there may be young birds or nests that can be disturbed by dogs running off lead.ldquoThe posters are to remind dog owners to keep their pets close to hand and not to encourage behaviour that may cause problems to wildle or indeed other visitors.ldquoThis issue of countryside disturbance is not unique to Levenhall Links or East Lothian but is recognised throughout the UK as more people are accessing the countryside than ever before and are unaware of how their actions can have an adverse impact on wildle.ldquoIt has been estimated around . million pets had been bought in the UK during lockdown.

We are entering the breeding season and last year was a very poor year for ground nesting birds, which is thought to be largely due to disturbance.ldquoSkylarks, meadow pipit and grey partridge are the key species in Musselburgh that suffer from disturbance.ldquoThe key message is lsquoareas of uncut coastal grassland may have nesting birds presentrsquo.

The message is to think about where to walk your dog. Try to avoid estuaries where birds are feeding and remember that nature reserves and coastal grassland are sensitive areas.Jason Rose, chairman of community group Friends of Musselburgh Links, said: ldquoThis has been an issue on and off over the years but does seem to have got worse in recent weeks.

Many owners are responsible, and we thank them.ldquoHowever, I also know that, on occasion, when a dog walker has been approached about disruptive behaviour, they have shown disinterest in the issue. These incidents clearly arenrsquot accidents and thatrsquos heartbreaking.ldquoThe lagoons are a Site of Special Scientic Interest and there were already prominent signs making this clear, asking people to stick to the paths and keep quiet.

I suppose perseverance is the province of every wildle photographer.Finally, one sunny afternoon, Chris and I decided to go for a drive around the local fields.The road was quite narrow, and we had to pull over to let another car go past.As soon as we stopped, I opened the window and saw them ndash a good dozen hares chasing across the field.Usually, you see only one or a couple at most, so this sighting was exceptional.We parked up in haste and rushed towards the binkying hares.

I could even see hair and saliva flying in the air ndash the field looked like it turned into a real boxing ring!As soon as the group flashed near us, I grabbed for my faithful camera and took several shots.There can be some confusion about whether or not the lsquoboxingrsquo hares are fighting, and whether this is an act between two malesor a male and female .This frantic behaviour usually occurs when a surge of testosterone pushes a buck to chase after his chosen doe across the fields in an attempt to mate.A doe can be chased by multiple bucks throughout the spring, which can understandably become a bit tiresome.This is when a female would turn around and fight a male off by initiating the boxing match. It is not unusual to see fur flying.It is believed that brown hares have lived in the UK since Roman times but are now considered naturalised.Their distinctive long, black-tipped ears and fast running make them easily distinguishable from rabbits.They are also much bigger and do not dig burrows.Hares live above ground in the open and dig lsquoformsrsquo: shallow depressions in the ground or grass.They can easily sink in the forms and blend in with the environment but, when disturbed, they take off and bound across the fields, often in a zigzag pattern.Brown hares can reach a speed of  miles per hour, which makes them Britainrsquos fastest land animal.Unlike many other British mammals, hares do not hibernate or store fat, so they need a constant food supply. They feed on a iety of grasses, herbs, twigs and bark to stay healthy.March and April are the best months to watch brown hares boxing, so I would like to encourage everyone to visit the local fields.Keep your eyes peeled for the hares and stay safe!www.facebook zanslens www.instagram zans_lens www zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"incredibly-disappointing-cancel-haddington-show-say-organisers","story":"The show, one of East Lothianrsquos most popular annual events, had been due to take place on June .However, for the second consecutive year, the committee of the United East Lothian Agricultural Societyhas made the dficult choice to not go ahead with the event.Alan Thomson, UELAS chairman, was disappointed to see the show again shelved due to coronavirus restrictions.However, he stressed that the safety of everyone involved was critical and it was not a decision taken lightly.In a statement, he said: ldquoCurrent Scottish Government guidelines suggest it would be almost impossible to run the event, which would usually attract a sea of competitors, trade stands, and visitors, from many dferent areas of Scotland and the north of England.ldquoThe safety of all our stakeholders is of paramount importance and, as such, we felt it was too great a risk to allow the show to take place this year.ldquoThe committee have already invested much time into the advance planning and organising of the event however, we all decided it would be in the best interests of the society to cancel now, rather than continue and risk costing the society money the longevity of UELAS is of utmost importance to us all.And he added: ldquoBeing forced to cancel our show for the second consecutive year is incredibly disappointing and we know how many people were looking forward to their annual visit to East Fortune.ldquoAlong with many others, we devote a great deal of time and have a huge emotional attachment to the show, so cancelling was certainly not a decision taken lightly.ldquoPlease take care of yourselves and your loved ones.

Not least because it will be a standing reminder of the controversy surrounding her governmentrsquos handling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond.Opposition MSPs on a Holyrood committee combined to declare that she had misled them. However, she was cleared by an official inquiry of breaching the Ministerial code and she comfortably won a confidence motion.:BRIAN TAYLOR:This is not a civil war in the SNP. This is more vicious and more visceralEarlier this week, SNP strategists were quietly hopeful that the worst of this issue was behind them. Ms Sturgeon must now hope that the momentum of an election campaign itself will subsume her former friendrsquos appeal.And so begins the first socially distanced election. The cynics among you may say that most people will find little trouble in staying far away from canvassing politicians. But, still, this contest really counts.Consider the cataclysmic changes since this Holyrood Parliament was elected in . Firstly, Brexit. The SNP will build upon that, but cautiously.They will recall that Scotland voted to remain in the EU and will argue that departure strengthens the case for independence. But, perhaps understandably, there will be few specics at this stage as to how and when Scotland would recreate links with Brussels.Secondly, the hideous plague. Self-evidently, the pandemic is the backdrop to the entire contest.Anecdotally, it would appear to be the received view that Nicola Sturgeon has worked tirelessly, although understandably Opposition parties will point to flaws.But what about broader strategy  The SNP will seek to build a post-pandemic economic and social consensus that ldquoScotlandrsquos recovery should be in Scotlandrsquos hands.That is couched to offend as few as possible. It most certainly includes the prospect of independence but does not explicitly rule out other devolved options, at least in the interim.In essence, it is a single transferable message: appealing to the underlying patriotic mood which created the SNP in the first place but also brought devolution into being.Of course, there is an added dimension. Most Nationalist speakers delivering their virtual stump speech will say ldquohellipin Scotlandrsquos hands, and not Boris Johnsonrsquos.They will seek to posit the Prime Minister as an external threat to Scotlandrsquos well-being, as antithetical to the Scottish perspective.Look at the four per cent pay offer to NHS staff in Scotland. SNP Ministers reckon that is genuinely merited and in keeping with the Scottish outlook. But it also helps that it is in contradistinction to the relative parsimony of the UK Government offer.It is also of course designed to quell Labour complaints, as is the move to take Scotrail into public ownership. Stand by for more universalism in the SNP manesto.The Conservative objective will be, as it was in , to corral supporters of the Union into voting Tory. They will depict their rivals as weak and vacillating, specically with regards to the prospect of a further independence referendum.Why then, you might ask, does Boris Johnson not pre-empt the issue by insisting that he will veto a referendum in any circumstances Because, of course, that would undermine the core of the Scottish Conservative campaign. They mean to depict the SNP as zealous fanatics, intent on independence, no matter what.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Alex Salmond launches pro-independence Alba Party ahead of Scottish election\",\"description\": \"Alex Salmond launches pro-independence Alba Party ahead of Scottish election\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media vRZxBmNB poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests vRZxBmNB.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": They plan to argue, further, that the only way to stop indyref is to prevent the SNP from gaining a majority at Holyrood. And they offer themselves as the ones to provide that obstacle, partly by depicting the SNP as ided, citing Alex Salmondrsquos latest initiative.More generally, an edict delivered by the PM would tend to reinforce the SNP message of external interference in Scotlandrsquos affairs. Douglas Ross knows that, especially in Holyrood elections, the voters want politicians to stand up for themselves and to stand up for Scotland.However, the Tories will say the best way to reinforce those Scottish interests is to use what they call the ldquobroad shoulders of the UK to rebuild the economy. Hence announcements such as the transition deal for North Sea oil.Labourrsquos new leader Anas Sarwar has three big challenges ahead. He too wants to thwart an overall SNP majority. But he wants to overhaul the Tories and regain second place.More generally, he wants to reverse a dismal Labour record. The party has slipped back in popular fortune at every Holyrood election since the very first in , when Donald Dewar entered coalition power.Mr Sarwar wants Labour to speak with a dferent tone. Less overtly aggressive and confrontational. More in keeping with the mid-pandemic anxieties of the voters over jobs, health care and education.He is very far from being a Sturgeon cheer-leader, not least because he is standing against her in her own constituency. But he thinks the Tories got it badly wrong when they called a motion of no confidence in her over the Salmond inquiry, before she had delivered her evidence.The Liberal Democrats will try triangulation, appealing to middle Scotland. They will depict the SNP as ldquoided and incompetent while inviting voters to shun the ldquoclumsy and cruel Tories.More broadly, they hint they are happy, once again, to talk to Labour, especially about widespread reform of the UK constitution. Labour strategists downplay any such link.The Greens, too, will stress the need for post-pandemic recovery, but will argue for a transformed economy, with a focus upon renewable energy and public transport. They say they are more committed to such aims than the SNP.:Brian Taylor: Herald columnist shares thoughts on indyrefParticularly seeking list votes, the Greens will target the SNP and others.

According to Professor Curtice, Mr Salmondrsquos sunny predictions of a pro-independence supermajority could turn to ashes on election day. Unless Albarsquos candidates secure a sufficient percentage of votes in the constituency lists their efforts may deprive the SNP of the handful of these they require to gain an overall majority.This of course, will rest on Mr Salmondrsquos personal popularity rather than on the attributes of Albarsquos other candidates. With every fresh vicissitude the former first minister of Scotlandrsquos sense of self-worth seems to swell. In similar circumstance most others would slink away, thankful simply to have survived the onslaught.Read more:Why on earth would Scotland want to be part of the EU anyway Of the other senior politicians only Anas Sarwar, new leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, responded with any measure of dignity. The rest, by degrees, exhibited many of the haughty and juvenile tendencies that have alienated so many rank-and-file voters. Nicola Sturgeon ndash now the primary target of her predecessorrsquos vengeance ndash couldnrsquot resist a pathetic dig at Mr Salmondrsquos perceived gambling habits. The partyrsquos Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, described Kenny MacAskill ndash the highest profile SNP defector to the new party ndash as ldquoan embarrassment.Mr Blackford, a nasty and vindictive politician, is still remembered across the political spectrum for the callous nature of his campaign against the tragic former Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy. Recently, he was forced to apologise for attempting to inflict mob justice on an innocent freelance photographer for breaching travel restrictions . At Westminster, Mr Blackford presided over meetings of his group which were barely-disguised, psychological ambushes to bring down his colleague, Joanna Cherry. One of these figures is indeed an embarrassment and itrsquos not Mr MacAskill.The nature of Mr Blackfordrsquos response encapsulates several of the reasons for Mr Salmondrsquos optimism. He and his senior colleagues have presided over the SNPrsquos transitioning from a party that exuded openness and bonhomie to one now characterised by authoritarianism and mind-control and built around the cult of their leader.Thus, the foot-soldiers of the wider Yes movement, those who turn up in all weathers to march under one banner for independence have lately felt a disdainful chill coming from those who gather around the SNP leadership. These people have felt betrayed and only too aware of how they are routinely portrayed by those using the Hate Crime Bill and gender theory to marginalise them. The suspicion persists among many of them that these ideological proclamations are convenient fig-leafs to cover the SNPrsquos failure to improve the le-chances of Scotlandrsquos poorest communities.Contempt for those who may be tempted to back Alba was apparent too in much of the media commentary. One writer dismissed all those thousands who have already pledged allegiance to the new party as ldquocranks, misfits and zoomers, these being the favoured slurs of middle-class commentators to dismiss anything they consider too rough to be worthy of actual engagement.Read more:Whats the SNPs problem with the working class Another idea thatrsquos taken root among the cafeacute politicos is that by playing more than one pro-independence team in the contest nationalists are ldquoGaming Democracy. Basically, this suggests that cornering the market in list seats as well as first-past-the-post ones is just not cricket, old boy, and undermines the spirit of the contest. Behave yourself.Democracy itself is the gaming of equality. Itrsquos how civilised, educated and opulent people mask the class-driven and unseen levers that still pull in their direction. You might think we exist in a state of one-person one-vote equality but the multi-billion-pound lobbying sector the adoption of neo-liberal power structures and the paths of least resistance always taken by politicians who promised to be radical indicate something . Boris Johnson dropped the pretence last week when he lauded the corporate \"greed\" thatrsquos apparently rescued us from the pandemic.The SNP leadershiprsquos fury at Mr Salmondrsquos re-emergence after hersquod been presumed permanently deleted should be viewed in the context of gravy trains being de-railed and comfortable lestyles jeopardised. His admitted inappropriate conduct in public office while being acquitted of any and all criminality will provide endless attack opportunities. These might carry more integritythey didnrsquot come from an organisation which has consistently ignored complaints from female members who have been threatened with sexual violence by known ndash and protected ndash party activists.Similarly, the accusations that Mr Salmond is threatening unity to satisfy his own ego-driven thirst for revenge. What unity  The parliamentary SNP has become a haven for preening, elitist performance artists while locking out working class people. It exists as a career opportunity for a cadre of mediocre middle-management types who gather to congratulate and affirm each other in issuing risk-free political emoluments. From time to time they pause, but only to abjure the thick proles for not being sophisticated enough to get on board with the progressiveness.We may all be entitled to take a certain view of Mr Salmondrsquos past conduct and his actual reasons for leading the Alba Party, but spare me the sanctimony and hypocrisy. Nicola Sturgeon, Ian Blackford and their parliamentary drones have fostered more ision in the SNP than anything that might be wrought by Mr Salmond. A generation of unbroken and unchallenged power has made them arrogant and self-indulgent. They have effectively established a party within a party and a platinum card membersrsquo lounge where access is granted only to a favoured few who are word-perfect in the leaderrsquos little red book of approved word and phrases.If Alex Salmond and Alba do damage the prospects of an overall Yes majority Nicola Sturgeon will only have herself to blame.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The former First Ministerrsquos move seeks to exploit worries of a deeper nationalist malaise.Keen gardeners among you will understand when I say that independence is like a plant that has lost its bloom. Apparently still healthy on the outside but betraying the unmistakeable early signs of internal decay ndash a prelude to a gradual loss of allure.Wherersquos the evidence, I hear you cry  Arenrsquot all the polls pointing in the right direction Well, yes and no. Certainly the headline figures of support for independence remain strong. However, hubristic SNP claims the polls demonstrate independence is now the settled will of the Scottish people are well wide off the mark. Dig a little deeper and itrsquos clear from the polls that holding another independence referendum any time soon is, for the vast majority of Scots recovering from the trauma of a pandemic, not a priority.The SNP strategy seems to boil down to trying to create a sense among Scots ndash contrary to evidence and their own preferences ndash that independence is somehow inevitable. A hope thatyou repeat a contestable assertion often enough people will start to believe it.Scotland is caught in a continuous loop of seemingly never-ending political campaigning. Eight trips to the polls in ten years. And,the SNP has its way, it will be Groundhog Day all over again in a year or so for Indyref. This is the Chinese water torture path to independence, relentlessly wearing down into submission an exhausted population.This isnrsquot how it was supposed to be. What happened to the much vaunted national conversations to build a groundswell of support sufficient for consistent poll numbers of over % support for independence  Or the promised joyous outbreak of lsquocivic nationalismrsquo ndash whatever that is Instead wersquove the sight of the man who lost decisively the  referendum trying to game the Scottish Parliament electoral system in a bid to force another. He claims that with barely more than a third of the regional votes he can deliver a lsquosuper-majorityrsquo of two thirds of all the seats. If he succeeds it would be grotesque misrepresentation of the true state of current Scottish opinion on the constitutional question. Is that all it takes these days to end over  years of partnership and break up the worldrsquos most successful multinational state Mr Salmond certainly thinks so. And why  Because he knows that his successor hasnrsquot done the work. Union supporters say rightly that Nicola Sturgeon is guilty of failing to improve public services because shersquos too focussed on separation. Die-hard nationalists accuse her of not being focussed on it enough. One begins to wonder what shersquos been up to all these years before Covid kicked in.Itrsquos a high risk strategy for Ms Sturgeon to double-down by directly putting independence on the ballot paper. Since  the SNP has done hardly any fresh thinking to address previous and new doubts about the independence prospectus. For example, the party has more currency positions than a Pilates class. And they apparently see no contradiction in inveighing against a hard border with the EU, when the inevitable consequence of their own separation plans is a hard border with the UK.So the SNPrsquos claims about wanting to improve the governance of Scotland ndash which are meant to sound principled and high-minded ndash ring hollow in light of what the Salmond affair reveals about how Scotland is governed today. Most of the serious thinking about how to improve governance on these islands is taking place on the Union side.

Scotland is a proud nation. The desire for Scotland to be the best it can possibly be is a noble cause all Scots share. But can anyone honestly say that the events of the last few years have burnished the lustre of independence Covid is an awful shared experience. A national crisis reminding us of the innate generosity of spirit, which exists in every part of our country. Common values demonstrating when the chips are down, we pull together.The SNP may want to put independence on the ballot paper. There will be something  on the ballot paper too ndash what values the people of Scotland want to represent them in the years ahead.

You wonrsquot know just how fearful farmers are about this until you see the results of a devastating dog attack on livestock hellip it can be horric.With sunshine forecast across the country from Friday, the masses are gearing up for a great big green escape to the countryside. But therersquos a major change this spring and that has been the explosion of new dogs over the last year which are about to be unleashed for the first time.Glancing down at my familyrsquos rough-coated Jack Russell terrier gnawing loudly on a Nylabone chew at my feet, I realise what a salvation our furry canine friends have been during this dficult time but am equally struck by the enormity of responsibility which comes with owning a dog and the training involved.My hat goes off to new dog owners who have invested in online training classes over the last year, but in the coming weeks, for many, it will be the first time their dogs will be let off the lead in an open space ndash putting their recall training into practice. That open space is likely to be on farmland, and our fields are quickly filling up with new-born lambs as farmers and crofters embark on one of their busiest seasons of the year.  Right to roam is a wonderful thing, but with unfettered access to the countryside, comes the duty of responsible access. So, in short, keep your dog on a lead around livestock and be wary of ground nesting birds and other wildle.This might seem mind-numbingly obvious to most reading this column, but the fact is, there are more than . million households in the UK who have brought a new pet into their families since the start of this pandemic. This includes a lot of new dog owners who may not be aware of the devastating consequences their cute fluffy pet could have on new-born lambs.I will never stop reminding people about the fact that any dog has the capacity to chase, maim and kill livestock, as every day I am confronted with painful stories and devastating images of farmers who have suffered the horric consequences of an out-of-control dog savaging their sheep.This past week, South of Scotland MSP Emma Harper received unanimous support for a Bill which sought to toughen the penalties on offer to the courts when convicting irresponsible dog owners involved in livestock attacks. Now, guilty iniduals could serve up to  months in jail and or a fine of up to pound,. For years, farming organisations and the police have been running educational campaigns warning dog owners of the consequences loose dogs can have on livestock, but now this new Bill will add further weight and deterrence.Since I started my job with the Scottish Farmer in , I have supported Emma Harper with her proposals and have followed her journey as she met up with farmers across the country, listening to their concerns and promising to bring them justice, so I felt a huge rush of emotion on Wednesday night when this Bill was debated for the third and final time in Holyrood and will now proceed for royal assent before passing into law in six monthsrsquo time.This is a huge moment for Scottish farming and offers much hope for the future that these incidents are being recognised and will be dealt with more fairly. The whole industry is indebted to Emma Harper and her team who have campaigned unreservedly on this over the past four years and these tough new penalties will hopefully send a strong reminder to dog owners of what is at stake,their dog chases or kills livestock. Keeping your dog on a lead around livestock isnrsquot the only thing that should be a no-brainer, but so should picking up your dog poo. This isnrsquot just a responsibility reserved for walking on our beaches or our streets, but also in our fields.Neosporosis is one of the hidden diseases which can be carried in dog faeces and poses a serious risk to livestock and other dogs. More dogs are being infected by the parasite neospora as a result of the growing trend for feeding dogs raw meat. The parasite sheds eggs passing out in dogsrsquo poo andleft behind in a field, can remain infectious for up to six months. If consumed by cattle, in contaminated water, grass or in hay this disease can cause abortions and is responsible for more than  per cent of abortions in cattle.I spoke to a local farmer from Ayrshire this weekend who told me that  acres of one of his silage fields was so saturated by dog poo that he was unable to use it to feed his cattle this winter. He had to accept that  bales ndash equating to around pound, ndash had to be discarded. He told me that despite there being a woodland running alongside the field with a route for dog walkers, that the public preferred to walk through his field and were oblivious to what their dogs leave behind. He is rightfully worried, that from this Friday, the hordes are about to descend, and his field will be ruined once again, and his livestock put at risk.We all should exercise our right to enjoy our beautul countryside, but be mindful of whose workplace you are passing through, and afford it the same respect you would ask for in ."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-art-galleries-dovecot-studios-now-online","story":"Now it has harnessed the latest hi-tech technology to keep visitors flocking in, albeit virtually, helping to engage audiences and raise vital funds to help safeguard Dovecotrsquos future.Celia Joicey, Director at Dovecot, Celia Joicey, revealed how a collaboration with Michelle Milnes, an entrepreneur from the Business Women Scotland network, helped them adapt to the pandemic.She said: ldquoDovecot normally welcomes tens of thousands of visitors per year, including artists and tapestry partners.

The police had been heavily criticised on all the news channels for failing to keep order. He wanted revenge. At the Anti- Poverty Rally organised by community activist Joe, black-clad anarchists had suddenly appeared and sparked a mini-riot.Joe Smith had secured a job as a hospital porter in Chloes Hospital in addition to his usual job as a joiner so that he could spend extra time with Chloe. She was  years of age but had leukeumia. He knew and she knew that she was very ill. He had discovered that Chloe was able to analyse everyday political events. He felt he benefited from her views. She was confrontational and feisty ndash just like her mother.ldquoDaddy ndash why cant people protest peacefully  \" asked Chloe as Joe sat beside her on a visitor`s chair one night. ldquoWhy cant you take the clowns with you when you want to say what you think is wrong  People listen to clowns.\" Joe left the hospital ward and thought about what Chloe had said. He and his friends often dressed up as clowns to raise funds for Chloes ward.Joe thought long and hard about what Chloe had said. He had an ideahellip..ldquoMy Daddy is a clown ldquo said Chloe to the ward sister ndash Sarah Burt ndash a few days later. ldquoAnd he is going to help the working class. No-one is better than anyone . And my Daddy is a clown who is going to do something about it.\" Sister Burt sighed inwardly and thought to herself: ldquoWhat is this child talking about  \"On Saturday  November  history was made.  police officers sat in expectation of a ldquo ruck at Ashfield Square. Joe Smith had organised an Anti-Poverty Rally and thousands were expected to attend. A helicopter buzzed overhead, while the police support units were on standby. Chief Inspector Aitken could barely conceal his excitement. That toe rag Joe Smith was going to get his just desserts.Chief Inspector Aitken radioed over to his ldquospotter ldquo in plain clothes around  noon on the Saturday. The rally was due to start at pm. In Ashfield Square there were very few people about but the spotter Sergeant Combes, in plainclothes, had advised him that crowds were gathering at the Ashfield City Football Stadium, half a mile from Ashfield Square. He suspected that they were going to all rally there before marching down to the Square. An hour later he confirmed that there was a crowd of around  but that they appeared to be enjoying a pop and rock concert and a circus. ldquoA circus  \", queried Chief Inspector Aitken. ldquo Yes, Governor,\" replied Combes.The crowd in the Ashfield City Stadium enjoyed the music and the circus. The clowns were a particular favourite. Everyone was having a good time apart from  or so black-clad anarchists.Chief Inspector Aitken was getting more and more bemused as it was now .pm and there was no sign of the crowd moving out of the stadium. Then a minute later his radio crackled into le and Sergeant Combes said, ldquoFour Hells Angels on Harley-Davidsons have arrived in the stadium.\" Five minutes later Combes radioed in to say: ldquo The bikers are on their way to you Governor, but I think I should warn you about something.\" ldquoNot now, Combes,\" barked Aitken, ldquoI am in command mode now.\"The police surrounding Ashfield Square braced themselves ready for action as four Harley-Davidsons thundered into the Square itself. The bikes stopped and from the back of each one, a clown alighted carrying a case. The clowns waved off the bikers who promptly left the Square. The police watched in astonishment as the clowns slowly unpacked their cases and then set up a table and four chairs. Then they all sat down and set out tea cups, a tea pot and cakes. The clowns poured themselves tea and chatted away to each other.ldquoWhat do we do now, sir \" asked CI Aitkens second in command Inspector Brian Donnelly. ldquoWe wait,\" said Aitken confidently. ldquoObviously this is meant to lull us into a  sense of security. Smith and his rabble will be here enough soon enough.\" An hour later, Aitken was about to have a coronary. The huge crowd was still up in the Stadium peacefully enjoying themselves while he was facing a table load of four clowns drinking tea.Eventually he snapped. ldquoDonnelly ndash arrest those four\", he shouted. ldquoOn what charge sir \" queried Donnelly. ldquoClowning around,\" yelled Aitken. ldquoAnd wasting police timehellip.anything you can think ofhellipAs each clown was led away in handcuffs by about six officers each, they showed clearly to the waiting news cameras the slogan on their chests ndash ldquoChloes Clown Army Says No To PovertyldquoChloes Clown Army  \" asked John Butler, Sky duty news editor, as he watched the first pictures coming in of the events at Ashfield. His news crew had been sent up to report on a possibly hostile Anti-Poverty Rally, but it was not expected to be very newsworthy. Now he was intrigued. His reporter on the ground went up to the stadium and reported back to him.John Butler immediately ordered his Six OClock News Team to work on the background to the story. Meanwhile in Ashfield Central Police Station Joe Smith and his fellow three clowns sat in separate cells and slowly smiled to themselves. CI Aitken had been in to tell them that they were all in very hot water and he expected the CPS to throw the book at them. Which was not the view of his  junior officers as they went off duty wondering why they had been told to expect a riot that afternoon.ldquoCan I watch the news on television, Sister  \" asked Chloe at around . that afternoon. ldquoOh wel,lyou must Chloe,\" replied Sister Burt. The TV was switched over to Sky and at pm the main news came on. Sister Burt nearly had a canary when Chloe shrieked ldquo Thats my Daddy !\" Sister Burt turned to see a report coming in from Ashfield Stadium and Square. There were shots of the crowd in the stadium, clowns on motorbikes, clowns having tea in the Square and then finally clowns being arrested.As she listened in she heard interviews outlining the iniquities of poverty. Members of Joe Smiths committee outlined how they had been determined to have a peaceful rally, so had deliberately kept the main crowd entertained in the Stadiumand gone for a thought provoking, very quiet event in the Square. And then one spokesman delivered his main punchline. \"We cannot thank Chloe Smith enough for inspiring us to Send In The Clowns.\" Sister Burts face was a picture. ldquoI told you my Daddy was a clown, said Chloe proudly.Well ndash the story hit the internet and soon went viral. The pictures of riot police arresting four clowns having a tea party resonated around the world. Joe Smith and his three fellow clowns were released on the Sunday morning after the Home Secretary intervened and demanded to know from the Chief Constable of Ashfield whether it was his intention to make the British Police the laughing stock of the world. CI Aitken was put on immediate sick leavehellip.And as for Chloe   Well, as you read this she is still very ill in hospital, and only time will tell. But her request to her Daddy to ldquoSend In The Clowns\" has been vindicated.JUDGES COMMENT: Very good and topical too.

She probably saw more of him than his we.Mr Salmonds response to the character issue has been: show not tell. Albas -strong candidates list today has a majority of women. It includes two leading feminist SNP defectors: Dumbarton councillor Caroline McAllister, and North Lanarkshire councillor, Lynne Anderson. They were recently elected as the SNPs Womens Convener and Equalities Convener respectively. Anyway you look at it, that is a remarkable coup.Read more: Hating Boris isnrsquot enough ndash this election will be dficult for the SNPThey were also signatories of the Womens Pledge on sex-based rights. Ms Sturgeons forthright promotion of trans self-ID may play well on Twitter, but many older feminists are profoundly opposed. Most voters find the idea of men becoming biologically female mystying at best. The SNP is keen to keep this policy under wraps until after the election.Gender overlaps with an age class ide that has opened up in the nationalist movement. Mr Salmonds appeal is very much to older working-class supporters of independence, rather than the managerialist elite who dominate Ms Sturgeons inner circle. Mr Salmond would have willingly led those massive independence marches in . Ms Sturgeon preferred to march with middle class Remainers in London, rather than the uncouth crowd in Edinburgh with their motorbikes and Wallace kitsch.At an Edinburgh Book Festival event, Ms Sturgeon even suggested changing the name of the SNP because she didnt like being tainted with the N-word. She hates being called a ldquonationalist. Mr Salmond accepts it. It is what it is. He still accepts the recruitment of boxer Alex Arthur, who is a star in Scotlands housing estates, but only known on social media for his offensive remarks about Romanians.The SNP and many commentators have portrayed Mr Salmond as a right-wing, Nigel Farage-style populist leading a rag bag of racists and misfits. And truth be told, there is something of the Brexit Party in Alba. It is a nationalist party that has come from nowhere and is built around the personality of an insurgent, populist leader.The big dference is that Mr Salmond remains avowedly pro-European.Mind you, Alba doesnt seem to have settled policy on Europe. It thinks Ms Sturgeon has failed to recognise that SNP policy is redundant post-Brexit. Since Britain left the EU, the SNP has tried to pretend that nothing has changed, that the borderless  prospectus still applies. Yet everything has, and Alba is right to call out this pretence.There will obviously be a hard border with Englandand when Scotland leaves the UK and joins the European Union. More precisely, there will be a trade and regulatory ide, since the pre-existing UK Common Travel Area will mean passports and visas are unnecessary after independence. Alba sees this as an issue that has to be addressed. Though in opening this Pandoras Box, Mr Salmond could end up with more than he bargained for.A lot of SNP supporters, and Alba fellow travellers, are distinctly unenthusiastic about rejoining the European Union, and not just because of Ursula von der Leyens threats to start a vaccines trade war. There has long been a eurosceptic strand in the SNP. Many on the left favour the Norway option of joining the single market but not the political institutions of Brussels. The SNP has tried to keep a lid on this debate too, but not for much longer.Read more: Scots may loathe him, but Boris doesnrsquot give a damn about Plan BMr Salmond has also called Nicola Sturgeons bluff about a Scottish independence referendum being imminent, delivered by a new Section  order from Westminster. That is simply not going to happen. It is fancul to believe that Boris Johnson is going to risk breaking up the UK just because the SNP wins a majority in Holyrood. He will simply keep saying that now is not the time for indyref, as Britain emerges from Brexit. Sir Keir Starmer will back him to the hilt. Mind you, there is equally no guarantee that Mr Johnson would recognise an SNP-Alba supermajority. He might just echo Ms Sturgeon saying it is ldquocheating.However, this argument that having a pro-independence party standing for list seats alone is somehow undemocratic, or ldquogaming the system as Ms Sturgeon puts it, is simply wrong. The Scottish Green Party is a pro-independence party which is also standing only in list seats. As the Times reported earlier this month, the SNP leadership has been in discussions with Patrick Harvie about a formal Green-SNP coalition and even used the term ldquosupermajority to refer to their combined electoral strength.From the point of view of an ordinary SNP supporter, voting Alba for list seats is a no-lose proposition. Older working-class voters will likely see Alba as preferable to the ldquowoke Greens, whose policy on transgender issues is so controversial that their star MSP, Andy Wightman, had to leave the party because he wasnt permitted to speak about it. At any rate, SNP voters will have to be given better reasons not to vote Alba than that Mr Salmond is a bad man and that standing on the list is cheating. Ms Sturgeon may have forgotten, but only a few years ago the Scottish National Party renamed itself ldquoAlex Salmond for First Minister on list ballot papers.This man is a huge part of SNP folk memory. The attempt to write him out of history, like a nationalist Trotsky, was never going to succeed. Rather than attacking him personally Mr Sturgeon would be better advised to stay silent. Let the electoral system do its work and see what the voters deliver. After all, she is still vastly more popular among Scottish voters than Mr Salmond. That surely speaks for itself.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Dave Thompson, a couple of years ago, did the arithmetic and suggested a separate but linked list independence party. Some of us saw the sense and expected her to bring him in for discussion, and agree to it with some degree of SNP control, such as a common  and commitment to support the SNP for government.Had she not dismissed his idea, ldquosupermajority would be her slogan now, because an SNP-supported but separate list party would have left little electoral space for Alba to elbow into.Ms Sturgeonrsquos error of rejection arose in my view from the  belief, nurtured by the cult of personality, that she is the one and only who matters in, and to, the independence movement. As she is finding out, that it is not so.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh.SUPERMAJORITY IS A NON-STARTERALBA MP Neale Hanvey believes that in the coming election a majority of nationalist MSPs would be representative of the electoral system, not the electorate. He is right. In the  election, the SNP secured . per cent of the constituency votes and .% of the list votes on a turnout of %. Its share of the electorate was therefore only .%. Hardly a resounding mandate for independence.The same thing will happen in the  election, so the idea of a \"supermajority for independence\" is a non-starter.William Loneskie, Lauder.* IF Alex Salmond were to achieve a supermajority in the Scottish Parliament which roundly defied the balance of the wishes of the Scottish electorate, it might not ignite civil commotion but it would be a text book formula for that outcome. Perhaps Mr Salmond, from his dalliance with Russian culture, feels ready for the task of unrepresentative governance.Michael Sheridan, Glasgow.NO VISION FOR OUR FUTUREANDREW Dunlopjoins a growing list of unionist commentators fervently hoping that Alex Salmondrsquos Alba Party will derail progress towards an independent Scotland.Nowhere in the article was there a vision of Scotlandrsquos future or what radical initiatives his Conservative Party might offer Scottish voters to address problems such as inequality and child poverty. The familiar themes of stoking fear of borders and currency predominate, insinuating that the Union is forever and that now will never be the time.Baron Dunlop of Helensburgh asserts that the Alex Salmond affair has shown deficiencies in Scotlandrsquos governance. I actually agree with him on this point after Mayrsquos election an urgent reassessment of the role of the Lord Advocate and the Crown Office is required. However, when considering how Scotland is governed, I would gently remind the noble Baron that he is an active member of the largest undemocratic assembly outside of China. As a member of the House of Lords he has never been elected to the Holyrood or Westminster parliaments yet he held executive office as Under Secretary of State for Scotland for two years under David Cameron and Theresa May. I doubtBaron Dunlop sees the hypocrisy of his position on this point or the irony of his accusation that Alex Salmond is ldquogaming the election while his colleague, Douglas Ross, was attempting, and failing, to facilitate a unionist electoral pact.I fear Andrew Dunloprsquos aspirations for the Alba Party to tarnish the First Minister and take seats from the SNP are misplaced. If anything, Mr Salmonds intervention is a greater threat to unionist list seats, particularly in the six regions where the SNP have no list seats due to their large constituency vote. The days of Scotland being governed by the ennobled and the entitled are coming to an end and the activities of unelected politicians such as Andrew Dunlop are one of the main drivers of the desire to put our future in the hands of the Scottish people.Iain Gunn, Elgin.MAKE SALMOND THINK AGAINTHE US has Donald Trump , England has Boris Johnsonand now Scotland has Alex Salmond .By their own admission, all \"Men Behaving Badly\". God help us.As a long-time independence supporter, I was pleasantly surprised when Alex Salmond stepped down after the referendum in . He had had a remarkable career and had been the outstanding politician of his era despite having some fairly obvious flaws, but there were signs that he was already losing the plot and Nicola Sturgeon appeared to be the ideal successor. Apart from a lack of flexibility in the independence campaign, tying himself rigidly to the pound sterling and offering no alternative to EU membership, Mr Salmond had already lost a lot of my respect when sooking up to Rupert Murdoch, Mr Trump and royalty.However, my heart sank when he came back to the forefront as an MP, as it was clear that his ego wouldnt allow him to remain in the shadows for long. I suspect that the unholy mess the SNP has got itself into is closely connected to his continuing to interfere from the sidelines both then and after losing his seat at Westminster. Not for Mr Salmond fading out of the limelight with a cushy number somewhere while writing his memoirs and playing golf.By his own admission, his conduct has been less than honourable and I hope that his tarnished reputation will dissuade the vast majority of independence voters from supporting his new party. Sadly, history as exemplied by Messrs Trump and Johnson shows us that this is not always case. I can only hope that the Scottish electorate is more discerning and sends Mr Salmond home to think again with his tail between his legs.Gordon Evans, Glasgow.NEW PARTY IS NOT INCLUSIVECOMING from France where the National Rally gets  per cent of the vote, I have always been surprised that there was no populist far-right nationalist party in Scotland. This has probably changed with the creation of the Alba Party.The National Rally in France defines itself as economically left-wing. It believes it protects the working class, and takes pride in being socially conservative. It claims to defend the \"average Frenchman\" and \"common sense\", against the \"betrayal of inevitably corrupt elites\". This ideology is replicated across the European far right, from Lega Nord to Vox.Alba does not have any policies or a manesto, but it is clear to see where it has positioned itself already.The presence of ex- Group members, like Kenny MacAskill and Alex Salmond, shows that its leaders want to present themselves as an old-fashioned socialist party on economic matters, class reductionist and radical.Their stance on social issues is transparent too. Alba rapidly defined itself as socially conservative: Mr Salmond repeatedly used anti-LGBT terminology in his commentary about womenrsquos rights and defines his nationalism as the kind that trumps any progress on social issues. \"Get indy done\" clamoured some of his supporters a few weeks ago.Despite Mr Salmondrsquos calls for unity, Alba is miles away from the inclusive nationalism the SNP or the Greens stand for. The SNP and the Greens should stay well away from Alba.Jeacutereacutemie Fernandes, Elgin.LET US AVOID THE RANCOURWHATEVER  Alex Salmond has done, by creating a new political party he has opened up the possibility of igniting the independence argument beyond the increasingly intemperate SNP-led debate and, by so doing, giving the electorate the chance to think of independence beyond the narrow SNP-dominated focus. In this context, Scotlands printed media should also be mindful both of its language and tone and allow for all views to be fairly and accurately represented.

Garden building in Bridge Street.Since he first set up shop in Laing Street, three decades ago, Mr Stevenson has gone from strength to strength. Aside from Grooves, he has established several hospitality ventures over the years, including Kirkwall nightclub Fusion, Harbour Street bar Helgi’s, and Albert Street’s Twenty One.Having moved location no less than six times since it began in , Grooves most recently found a home in the redeveloped Old Library on Laing Street. But last week, it was announced that the business would be moving once more — back to Albert Street. What’s more, the shop is set to be split between two premises. Grooves Toys will be based at the former Woollen Mill building, while Grooves records will move to what is currently Little Island. Meanwhile, Archive Coffee and the Sound Archive will remain at Laing Street, leaving the rest of the Old Library building ripe for redevelopment.If this wasn’t a big enough sht already, Mr Stevenson is set to finally take the big leap west, setting up shop in the former Commercial Hotel premises in Stromness, selling toys.All the while, the Orcadian entrepreneur will be getting plans under way for another signicant redevelopment, this time on Kirkwall’s Bridge Street.The former R. Garden and Scarthcentre buildings have been in the hands of the Bute-based Orissor Trust, which also owned Little Island, since . In that time, the Scarthcentre part of the building has served as the venue for a Creative Scotland art installation, discount store Wisebuys, an indoor market, and most recently a store for Kirkwall Amateur Operatic Society. Now, Mr Stevenson hopes to refurbish the former department store premises in a two-phase project, with the initial phase set to span the next two years.Full story in The Orcadian, available now online and in the shops.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Skaw#s designation as a nationally important monument was also referenced by objectors.Many of those in support, however, highlighted the new jobs and boost for Unst#s economy.HES said that while it recognised the ldquoprobablebenefits of a national space centre, the application failed to demonstrate why the location was necessary.#There is therefore no compelling case for the nationally important historic environment considerations to be set aside for the development,# it said.#The application has not demonstrated that any benefits that would arise from the application could not be achieved where, outwith the scheduled area.#HES, which isthe lead public body protecting Scotlandrsquos historic environment, wields signicant power in the planning process.

I would like to congratulate Kyleakin Playpark project on their award, theirs is an important project and will support people now and in the future when they can physically come back together to make great things happen in their community.”The final piece in the funding jigsaw came from a Highland Council ward discretionary grant of £,.Local councillor John Finlayson said: “Myself and fellow members were really impressed by the fundraising drive to date and the fact that through ious channels, almost £, of the funding was secured before the ward discretionary was turned to.“The fundraising to date made the decision to support the final piece in the jigsaw very easy and members were keen to point out that this project highlights how community drive and partnership working, that includes a clear strategic vision, can achieve positive outcomes.”James MacQueen Building Contractor’s Limited gave £, and a developers’ contribution from Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association of £, was made linked to the construction of the new houses.A further £, came through the Kyleakin Gala MOWI Scotland donated £, Kyleakin and Kylerhea Community Council gave £, online crowdfunding brought in £, while £ was raised through the Balmacara SPAR.It is hoped that the park will be completed by late summertime."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/LAMB-SALES-19-2.jpg","title":"the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIt is far from a new problem and one that very much sits hand in hand with a long-standing wider issue in relation to crofting development and productivity – lack of use and neglect.You don’t need to go far to come across overgrown and rank crofts, where fences have rotted away and the ground has been covered in a blanket of coarse, dead vegetation. It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests. The trouble is: there is precious little evidence of that calibre of inidual in Scotland’s political landscape of today.IT SEEMS like only yesterday I was talking about preparing for the winter and here we are with spring on the horizon.

Not a disaster by any means, particularly in this part of the world, but my own lowest tally ever, as usually I’m looking at somewhere around the  to  per cent mark.I suspect an underlying issue with fluke at tupping time. Fasciola hepaticais a tiny mud snail which is ingested through grazing and attacks the liver. It thrives in wet conditions and is re in Scotland.There are routine treatments, but it’s now recognised that the parasite is developing a resistance to some of the products on the market. As a result of that, the advice is to constantly use dferent ones and I probably wasn’t as meticulous in this as I should have been, although I know that others too have had increased problems with fluke in the early part of the winter – and it was horrendously wet in November through to December.So the dry, hard frost of a couple of weeks ago was a godsend and it was on such a bracing but beautul morning that we gathered for the scanning, the ground underfoot like uneven concrete. You could have gotten away with your trainers.Once the work was completeI linked up my iPhone with the scanner and a detailed breakdown of the results popped up on the screen. A couple of pings later and it was out in the ether, all the way out to the North Sea where it was downloaded by someone not able to be in attendance to view his own results almost instantaneously.It was a lovely symbiosis of tradition and technology, though goodness knows what the bodachs of yesteryear would have made of it all."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/John_Purser-202030713-edited.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais pure escapism among the fenian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThat may explain why story-telling and mythology were so highly prized.

Headed by matriarch Katherine, played by Amanda Burton, the clan was infiltrated by Marcella , who went undercover as Keira Devlin.Series location manager Chris Myers said Larchfield House was ideal for the shoot as it was large enough to suggest the status of our story#s resident family but not so daunting in scale as to be unimaginable as a home.While the family#s dark behaviours might have shocked many viewers, it seems the beauty of the area still appealed.Coming in at fourth place in the top  of drama locations that have helped spark a property boom is ITV police drama The Bay, written by Co Armagh man Daragh Carville.Property prices in the coastal Lancashire town of Morecambe rose by .% - a jump of % on nearby Scale Hall. House prices now average £,.Earlier this year property website Rightmove revealed searches for homes in Morecambe surged by % in just one week, coinciding with the airing of season two of The Bay.The adaptation of Sally Rooney#s Normal People is also being credited for a rise in property prices in Co Sligo. Sharing joint final place in the list with Marcella, the location used in Normal People for much of the shoot also saw a rise of .% - % more than neighbouring Leitrim.Topping the list of television locations that have inspired househunters is Dunlop in East Ayrshire, set of ITV drama Deadwater Fell.

He added: DS Properties are acquisitive, and they#ve done great things with Crescent Link. They see this park as a key asset to their portfolio.Speaking at the time of the acquisition, Holywood Exchange#s new owner said it was very confident about the economic prospects for Belfast and Northern Ireland as a whole and says the latest purchase very much builds on this confidence in the Northern Ireland economy.The impact of the pandemic has affected all businesses and the retail sector has been no exception to this, spokesman Matthew Beddow said.Belfast Most ReadVideo: Stunning Co Down home that’s not run of The Mill£m office sale in Belfast becomes biggest ever in NIVideo: IRA chanting as hundreds party again in Belfast Holyland sparking fears of Easter disruptionMan in his s dies in M crash Solicitor for six mourners sanctioned in east Belfast seeking review after Storey funeral decision by PPSTop VideosPlayIRA chants as Holyland parties continue into the early hoursPlayArlene Foster calls for PSNI chief to quit over handling of Bobby Storey funeralPlayDrone shows amazing Co Down mill propertyLatest Northern IrelandClaim Scots face Troubles similar to NI ‘outrageous’Five more schools abandon the transfer test for next yearHomeowners Friel the benefit... how TV#s Marcella pushed up Lisburn house pricesUTV weatherman Frank Mitchell#s final forecast leaves viewers #in tears# as he retires from screen rolePolice seize £ million worth of suspected Class A and B drugsLatest from Belfast Claim Scots face Troubles similar to NI ‘outrageous’Five more schools abandon the transfer test for next year#I#d never seen a lawnmower... it#s hard to get a job when you have a criminal record#AIB Group reports an adjusted pre-tax loss of £m Belfast duo Bicep up for two gongs at BRIT Awards,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Redcastle hotel is located in the once proud and independent peninsula of Inishowen. The last of the Irish chieftains with whom this site is associated was Cahir ODoherty. Cahir became chieftain at the age of  in , after the death of his father, Sir John O Doherty. In order to secure his position, Cahir changed his family’s side in the Nine Year War year and swore loyalty to Queen Elizabeth, because of Inishowens important strategic location and the defeat of the Confederates at Kinsale in . googletag.cmd.push The war ended in . It resulted in the Flight of the Earls from Rathmullan in  and the Plantation of Ulster. Cahir thought his reward for his help and loyalty would be great. But apart from being knighted and acquiring the title Sir, he was to be disappointed. In frustration the -year-old chieftain rebelled in , sacking the English held city of Derry and burning it to the ground. He was killed shortly after this in the Battle of Kilmacrennan, just outside Letterkenny. Because of this rebellion King James I ordered the great walls of Derry to be built. After Cahir, the last Inishowen Chieftain, was killed, all his lands in Inishowen were seized by the James I for plantation and ided between The Established church and Arthur Chichester. The two separate entities that were then Inishowen and Tyrconnell were joined and made into one county. It was named Donegal. googletag.cmd.push The first house built on the site of the Redcastle hotel was built by the Carey family. The Cary family were landlords who received plantation lands from Moville to Muff. The family lived here from about  to , almost exactly  years. Unfortunately for the Careys, they had money problems and eventually were forced to sell the Redcastle house and Estate in . Thomas Doherty from Muff purchased the house from the Careys, but because of legal issues it took  years for them to complete the sale. The most famous of the Careys was Joyce Carey. Joyce Cary was listed in the top  writers in English by The Sunday Times. Some of his books were made into film. His son and grandson continued in the creative theme and were involved in TV series such as Dr Who and Captain Pugwash.     Thomas Doherty left the estate to his youngest daughter, Jane, who was married to Dr Richard Doherty, a lecturer in midwery in Queens University, Galway. Dr Richard Doherty died in  and his we Jane in . Richard converted to Catholicism late in his le and left the Redcastle estate to his daughter, Elizabeth and her husband Captain Ernest Cochrane, on the condition that the children be brought up as Catholics. The year before Elizabeth died she was in dispute with the local land league on the reduction of rents. Armed men were employed to secure her crops after locals refused to harvest them. They were unsuccessful at getting the crops harvested, but it is said they did get through quite an amount of Jameson whiskey and food. Captain Ernest Cochrane was the son of the famous and notorious Lord Thomas Cochrane, on which the films Master and Commander and Hornblower are based. Earnests famous bloodline does not end there as he is also a descendent of Robert the Bruce who actually invaded and occupied Northburg Castle in Greencastle for a short period. True love must have been very much in the air as the condition that Richard Doherty left for marriage and inheritance at this time would have been quite a diplomatic feat, given that Earnest was also the high sherf of Donegal. But they managed it. Captain Cochrane went to church in his Model T car. Reg number Hand Elizabeth and her children in their horse and carriage to Drung Chapel. To this day they are still separated, Earnest in a grand monument grave in front of the now derelict Church of Ireland Church in Redcastle. Elizabeth Francis with her children and her parents are interred at the alter area of the old Catholic Church, Drung. After the ious land acts that were introduced after , landlordism went into terminal decline. Lands were sold off and the large houses were either left to rot away or knocked down to avoid taxes on them. Redcastle House survived. Captain Earnest Cochrane died in  and Elizabeth Francis in . The Cochranes remained and turned their hand to farming and in the s opened the Redcastle House as an Hotel. The Cochranes sold Redcastle in  and the hotel is now once again back in the ownership of a Doherty.

There is not a girl woman anywhere who doesnt like a piece of jewellery or an aromatic fragrance. You could include a few men in that, too! Among them are two young Derry girls who love all things glittery and sparkly – and a nice fragrance – so much so, they have used their time during Covid- lockdown to start up their own fragrance business. Sisters Mia, , and Bella Doherty, , from Cornshell Fields in the Ballyarnett of the city, named their enterprise Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella- a combination of their names – and after almost a year of research, trials and checking out regulations, they have their enterprise up and running. googletag.cmd.push At the minute, they are making wax melts of ious fragrances and shapes along with room sprays to match the wax melts smells. They are also currently looking into other products as well. Mia, who attends St Marys College, said they began researching soon after the Covid- restrictions were introduced in March last year. She added: “We undertook online courses in candle-making tohelp our wee idea become a reality. “We tried out dferenttypes of soya wax andfragrances with our family being thetesters, much to their delight for a goodfew months. “We wanted to be % happywith our product before we decidedthey were ready for purchase.So the launch of Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella began last month. googletag.cmd.push “We are both currentlyusing our mum’s kitchen but she doesn’tmind as we clean up after ourselves and her house always smells solovely for her. “Also, by law, we have to follow certain regulations, so have to ensure CIP labels are made for every fragranceoil and then bepresently packaged. This can all take a lot of timebut we really love being creative and by adding glitter and colour and trying out dferent designs makes our wax melts stand out compared to others.Having nice packaging and how they are presented is very important to us “We make wax melts by melting soya wax and adding fragrancesoils and pour into moulds, although this sounds very straight forwardthere is temperature taking anda few step-by-step instructions that need to be adhered toin order to maintain a good quality product that will last.”     Despite the success and the enjoyment of making fragrances, Mia said she was looking forward to going back to school. “St Mary’sis a fantastic school and I love getting up to go to school every morning.” She admitted she was a bit concerned about how much catching up she will have to do but said she was sure the teachers would put everyone at ease when they were all back in the classroom. “We definitely missed schoola lot,especiallynot seeing our friends was dficult but starting this business has helpedkeep us occupied and easeanyboredom. “Learning our craft and keeping upwithschoolwork has made the wholeCovidsituation fly in for us. Weare so busy at the minutewith orders for delivery that our mum had to help out as well. She is able to help at the minute as her business is currently closed due toCovid- restric- tions.She was a great help at the start as she was able to guide us in the right direction - we have even roped dad into helping by doing the deliveries.” She added: “I hope we go back to normality as I like the hands on physical activities at school like technology and science experiments.” Bella, who ed to P at Steelstown Primary School on Monday last, said despite the enjoying of producing Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella products, school work was her priority. “I was a bit nervous about ingto school but it was great. I have a new teacher and she is really lovely. It was great seeing all my friends as well. This is my last year in primary school so I am really happy to be getting backto see everyone before I have to make the transition to secondary school.” Bella said they had been inundated with very positive reviews for their range of products. “Everyone seems to love the product going by the lovely messages we receive.Customers wish us every success andfor more orders so this makes us very happy. “When we are back at school full-time and not able to commitour time as much to the business as school is the priority, my aunties are willing to help out to keep us well stocked up with our products. “The people in our cityand beyondhave been really supportive inshopping local, it feels good to know we’re doing something right.” The girls mother, Maria, is understandably so proud of her two girls, being the owner of Miabella beauty salon next to the car wash on Racecourse Road in Shantallow which has been closed for nine months of the past year. She said: “If there’s one thing I can take from lockdownis that I work too much and the girls missed me, so spending quality time and helping them out with their wax melts was amazing. I’ve learned so much from them and how much of a work ethicis instilled into them, “I am so proud of them both andhow they have juggled both school work and their newly established business. “They both are managing perfectly so farand I can go back to work and know they are perfectly capable of staying on top of orders. “As their mum, though, I will keep on top of the social mediato ensure their safety - their page is linked to my phone so I can keep them safe.” Maria conceded she has found lockdown extremely dficultat times. She added: “I really miss my clients, as a lot of them have become friends over the years. It’s always good to catch up with each other.I’m so looking forward to seeing each and every single one of them when I canalthough trying to fit everyone in will prove to be a dficult task. “Somehow, I’ll man- ageshould I work night and day to get you all beautied again.I don’t like to disappoint anyone when they look for appointments, my clients are lovely and are very understanding.” So Chanel, Jimmy Choo and Gucci, take note of the name - Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Four Donegal sisters, Johanne, Susan, Marcia and Dorothy Gallagher, have entered their family home into a prize draw. Along with the property, the winner will also receive pound, in cash. This enchanting homestead, on approximately . acres, is in South West Donegal. It includes a farmhouse with a modern extension and amenities as well an adjoining second property that was previously used as a seasonal hostel and camping site.  It is located between Dunkineely and Bruckless in southwest Donegal.

Entrants must be aged  or over. Tickets for the draw are poundthrough UK site raffall and the draw will take place on May  at pm. Ben and Lyndall’s le story is about love and loss and could potentially bring substantial benefit to neurosurgical patients of Beaumont Hospital. In the s, Irish man Ben Gallagher met his we to be, Lyndall, at a dance in Sydney, Australia. They started a relationship that would eventually lead to marriage, the birth of five daughters and ajourney to Ireland which brought Australian-born Lyndall to live permanently on the other side of the world. googletag.cmd.push Ben and Lyndall fell in love with a property in Bruckless, Donegal where they would farm and bring up their family. However, a serious spinal injury that Ben suffered in Sydney cut short his farming career and the couple set up a new business, converting the farm buildings into a hostel  camping facilities. His health problems continued and then Lyndall, following treatment for breast cancer, was diagnosed with a brain tumour and underwent an awake craniotomy in Beaumont Hospital under Mr Stephen McNally. The couple were married just one week short of  years when Ben passed away in March and Lyndall sadly died eight weeks later in .     It was a devastating loss for their daughters who are now putting up the family home that Ben and Lyndall established as the prize for an online draw. Along with the house and land also comes the hostel  camping facilities, a walled garden and ious outbuildings plus pound, stg in cash. The property is situated on the Wild Atlantic Way en route from Donegal Town to Killybegs.

The Derry  Commemoration Committee had encouraged people to attend the commemoration in Creggan on Easter Monday. However, there had been appeals for the event not to go ahead because of the current Covid restrictions. In a statement today, the organisers of the event, the Derry  Commemoration Committee, said that having entered comradely talks with Saoradh they have decided to alter our planned Easter Monday commemoration to a dignied wreath laying ceremony. The statement continued: It is clear that there are those who are endeavouring to turn the worldwide pandemic into a political stick to deflect the attention and scrutiny that is at present focused on British Crown Forces after their attack on the Creggan community on the th of March. googletag.cmd.push We as Republicans cannot allow this to happen. Our wreath laying ceremony will be fitting and dignied.

At present, the council is responsible for paying all the costs associated with the management of City of Derry Airport. This is costing local ratepayers pound.m a year. However, the council says thatthe airport is to have a future, large-scale financial support is needed from both the British and Irish governments. Details of a new business case for the management of the airport were revealed today at a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The councils Lead Finance Officer, Alfie Dallas, told the meeting that the business case has three key elements. The first is a request for a funding package of poundm from the British government over the next six years. This, Mr Dallas said, would equate to a contribution of pound.m a year towards the running costs of the airport. The second main element of the business case would be a further request that the British government continues to provide % of the funding required to maintain the air route from Derry to London. The government has already said that it will continue to cover the cost of the London route through a Public Service Orderuntil . googletag.cmd.push PSOs provide funding for air routes which are seen as vital for the economic development of the region they serve. The new business case from the council asks the British government to continue fully funding the London route after . Another key aspect of the business case, Mr Dallas said today, was negotiating with the Irish government to create a PSO air route between Derry and Dublin. Mr Dallas said the council had received signicant support from the British government and the Northern Ireland Executive to cover the losses at the airport as a result of the pandemic. However, in relation to the long-term future of the airport, he said the council could not continue to subsidise the facility at the current rate.     “The need for government intervention at this point is critical,” said Mr Dallas. The councils chief executive, John Kelpie, said a lot of hard work had gone in to the preparation of the business case. “If this application to government or governments is successful it will signicantly reduce the financial challenge on council and the responsibility for the sustainability of the airport will become a shared responsibility with the council and our partners in government. “Clearly the journey ahead to reach that point will be challenging. It will require a lot of hard work to progress our case but it is actually very encouraging at this stage even in advance of producing this report to government that we have seen a number of positive engagements from government over the last number of months.” Councillors at todays meeting unanimously supported a proposal that council officers now urgently communicate with the two governments in relation to the new business case for the airport.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Fort George site is owned by the Department for Communitieswho is leading on its regeneration. There has been many years of debate over what the prominent riverside should be used for. However, to date, only a large office block has been built on the land. After an Expression of Interest exercise, DfC entered an agreement with the Western Health and Social Care Trustso that they could further develop their proposal for the health and care centre to be located on the site. googletag.cmd.push Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said: “Fort George is a strategic regeneration site that has huge potential to create real social and economic benefits for the City of Derry and beyond. “I am delighted to announce that I have agreed to provide part of the site to the Western Health and Social Care Trust for their Health and Care Centre. My Department is committed to maximising Fort George’s potential and is delighted to work with the Trust to accommodate this ambitious development which will deliver key health services to the community in Derry.” The department says that the development of a Cityside Health and Care Centre is anticipated to create  new permanent jobs as well as centralising approximately  posts in a modern state of the art facility. googletag.cmd.push The positions will include nursing, social work, allied health professional and administrative roles as well as the relocation of a number of GP surgeries. Health Minister Robin Swann welcomed the proposed new centre. “This is an important step towards ensuring the delivery of high quality integrated primary and community care services within the city-side of Londonderry, and also towards improving the health service infrastructure within Northern Ireland. I recognise the efforts of all concerned in securing the site for this new facility and my Department will continue to support this project as it moves to the next stage.” Alan Moore, Director of Strategic Capital Development with the Western Health and Social Care Trust,said: “The Western Trust welcomes the decision by the Department for Communities Minister to agree to the sale of part of the Fort George site to the Western Trust.     I want to thank the Minister and her local officials with whom the Trust has worked closely over the past number of months. The announcement today will assist in facilitating plans for the Cityside Health and Care Centre at Fort George, bringing together GP and associated healthcare services in an integrated model.” Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey continued: “My Department has already started a piece of work to revise the existing Fort George masterplan. This revised masterplan will determine the location of the Health and Care Centre on the site and will also provide further clarity in relation to further potential development opportunities for the wider site in the future.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, SDLP Foyle MLA Mark H Durkan has expressed reservations about the proposal for the Fort George site. “While it would be foolish not to see the merit in a new health hub, particularly in the current climate, Fort George is perhaps not the most suitable location, said Mr Durkan. “People will no doubt see this announcement as falling short of earlier proposals, promises and plans. In short, it could be deemed a reduction in terms of ambition.     I am of the opinion that this strategically important development site would be better utilised for something that adds real value economically to the city and beyond. “However, that being said, I am acutely aware of the challenges facing our health service pre-pandemic. A system already at breaking point has struggled under the weight of the past year- this state-of-the-art facility will I hope, take pressure off that system and ensure the effective delivery of integrated health services for the surrounding areas. The creation of  permanent jobs is also good news, particularly in conjunction with the transfer of Health Sciences to Magee University, which I hope will encourage more students to train and remain.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The shutting of the outlet at Lisnagelvin Shopping Centre is one of  stores earmarked for closure across Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North East of England. The companys other store in the city at Foyleside Shopping Centre on the cityside is to remain open. The closures have been prompted by ongoing challenges to high street trading, which have been exacerbated by the Covid- pandemic. Semichem, which is owned by community retailer Scotmid Co-operative, said it was in talks with landlords in several locations and would make a final decision on a small number of the  stores in the coming months. googletag.cmd.push A total of  Semichem staff have now entered a formal consultation process. Management at Scotmid Co-operative, owners of Semichem, said they were exploring opportunities to redeploy as many as possible within its wider business. Karen Scott, head of Semichem, said: “The high street was already struggling to adapt to the pace of change in shopping habits, including out-of-town developments and the rise of internet shopping. That change has undoubtedly been accelerated by the Covid- pandemic. Sadly, we have reached the point where it is no longer viable to keep some of our stores open. “We are grateful for both Scotmid and subsequent government sup- port, which has undoubtedly prolonged the le of many stores.

This is the daunting schedule facing Connor Coyle next week as he steps into the ring for the first time in  months. The Derry middleweight will fly to Mexico for the equivalent of a long weekend as he aims to get his professional career back on track in . The -year-old, who is -, has not been in action since January last year when he defeated Miguel Dumas, and he is eager to get going once again. On April th, he will step into the ring in Chihuahua, Mexico against hometown boxer Esteban Villalba , after a break of  days due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. googletag.cmd.push It has been a long, long wait for Coyle, who has never stopped training in the hope that he would get the phone call for his next fight. “I didn’t think I would have been out this long. I’m just happy that there’s now something in front of me,” he said. “It’s completely dferent when you have a focus. I haven’t stopped training since my last fight but you push yourself to a dferent level when you have a fight in front of you. You feel a massive dference in the gym when you now you have a focus, especially trying to get your weight down. googletag.cmd.push “You need that motivation and that hunger to be training for something. The excitement is there and I have a lot more energy because I am pushing myself for something, rather than just ticking over and training to keep myself in shape. Because I haven’t stopped from my previous fight, that helped keep the momentum up whenever I really had to put the head down.”  Daunting Schedule There is no doubting that Coyle faces a dficult schedule next week. He has very little time to adapt to the change in setting, with what plans to be a hectic few days, with just two days in Mexico before he steps into the ring.      “I’ve never done this before,” he admitted. “I know when I travel to Florida I arrive at night time and sleep that night so I’m up fresh the next morning to go training. This is basically going to be the same thing. I’m flying over at night-time so when I get over I’ll be able to get some rest and get up and weigh in and rest again until the fight. I don’t think I’ll have any problems because it’s straight over and back. I’ll probably feel it coming back because it will catch up with me but on the way over I think I’ll be okay.” Villalba will be Coyle’s third Mexican opponent in succession, but despite a rather inconsistent record, the Derry man is expecting this particular Mexican to be on a dferent level. “I don’t know too much about him but I know he’s a tough operator and he’s very, very durable,” he explained. “We’re fighting in his home town so he’ll have no travelling to do, he’ll get up out of his bed and go and weigh in, or go and fight or whatever. He’ll be well rested. “All Mexicans are tough operators so I’ll be going into the lion’s den in this one and I’ll be expecting hard rounds, so hopefully we can get him out of there early. My last two opponents were Mexican, but this guy takes it to another level. He’ll be tougher.” Ultimately, the goal for Coyle is to get back to America, with this fight seen as something of a warm up for the real action when he gets back to the States. “They are making it very dficult with the travelling and the restrictions so I’m going to try and make the most of it when I go where and stay for a few fights,” he stated. poundIf all goes well and I go over in August or September, I’ll possibly stay until Christmas time and get in as many fights as I can until then.” Sponsors Connor would like to thank the following sponsors for their continued support, especially during such a dficult time. They are: Thirsty Goat, Celebrity Slots, Classique Floor Designs, Central Site Development, Doire Designs, The Bentley Bar, Conor Curleys Cars, Frankie Ramseys, Brooklands Fencing, Archibald Construction, RB Tiling Services, Pauls Butchers and Olympus Fitness.

It was extremely disturbing. There were very unpleasant low vibrations felt through the floor and transmitting up through the chair I was sitting on.ldquoIt was unpleasant because we felt like they were damaging the house and we had no control over it.Mr Clford said the vibrations were made worse due to the floating concrete foundations of his house.He believes Openreach should have surveyed the street before work started and used a smaller track digging machine to limit the vibrations.He also claims he was treated ldquowith contempt when he broached his concerns to a contractor.Openreach has apologised to Mr Clford, but points that the work to lay the full fibre broadband, which should be finished in a monthrsquos time, will bring major bring major benefits to , properties in the Ardglass area.ldquoWe apologise to Mr Clford and the residents who have experienced disruption and inconvenience, a spokesperson said.ldquoWe also wish to thank residents for their patience while this work has been taking place.ldquoWersquove introduced new techniques to minimise disruption and avoid digging where possible.ldquoHowever, in order to complete parts of the new network in Ardglass we have had to add additional ducting, which has required civil engineering work.ldquoThe new network will be commissioned within the next month and residents will be able to contact their communication provider to connect to faster full fibre broadband.The spokesperson said the work in Ardglass was part of a major infrastructure investment by Openreach bringing next generation broadband across Northern Ireland.ldquoFull Fibre broadband means that each property can connect directly to the exchange with a fibre optic cable, the spokesperson continued.ldquoThe new network will have a dramatic and positive impact on both broadband speeds and reliability, which is welcomed by householders and businesses demanding increased broadband speeds as a result of home schooling, working from home, and adapting to the impact of coronavirus on our daily lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24March2021-AVery.jpg","title":"A very different St Patrick’s Day  ","story":"IT was a very dferent St Patrickrsquos Day service at Down Cathedral last week.Instead of a normally packed cathedral for the annual cross-community service, there were just a few clergymen including Bishop David McClay and the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull.Both men also took part in the wreath-laying ceremony at the patron saintrsquos final resting place in the adjoining graveyard.In addition to the cathedral service which was streamed online, a number of other events to celebrate St Patrickrsquos Day took place over the internet, including a popular prayer pilgrimage.Children and families were able to celebrate at home or locally with a specially commissioned lsquomuddy prayer trailrsquo based on words from St Patrickrsquos Breastplate.St Patrickrsquos Day celebrations normally attracts visitors from across the globe with then dayrsquos activities beginning with a service at Saul mdash the site of Patrickrsquos first church.This was not possible this year due to Covid restrictions. Bishop McClay and Dean Hull celebrated a simple service of Holy Communion before walking prayerfully from Saul to the Cathedral.Meanwhile, pilgrims at home were invited to take a virtual prayer pilgrimage with Glynis Matchett with a short film premiered on social media.The pilgrimage is inspired by Patrickrsquos journey from slave to missionary and reflects on his faith and passion for the gospel.At noon Dean Hull welcomed viewers to a live broadcast from Down Cathedral, with the Bishop leading the service.The guest speakers included Patrick Regan and singerndashsongwriter and Andy Flannagan who also joined in via video.Conscious that the past year has seen many thousands of people face traumatic situations and signicant mental health issues, the diocese had chosen the theme lsquoWhen Faith Gets Shakenrsquo for the service.Patrick Regan is the author of a book by the same name and founder and chief executive of mental health charity Kintsugi Hope which aims to create safe and supportive spaces for those struggling with emotional and mental health challenges.He is also the founder of urban youth work charity XLP and the author of five books. Patrick has travelled widely working with and on behalf of the poorest communities and is a regular contributor on radio and television on issues of poverty and justice.Andy Flannagan is a Lutonndashbased, Irish singerndashsongwriter who was previously a hospital doctor.His campaigning song writing drew him into the political arena, and he is Executive Director of Christians in Politics. One of his driving passions is to see a just rewiring of the global economic system.Drawing on their own experiences, Patrick and Andy encouraged people to be honest with God in lament and to trust that he brings beauty from their brokenness.Andy sang two pieces ndash Fragile and a song of complaint based on Psalm , while soloist, Ruth Thompson, sang two songs ndash What Grace is Mine and Christ Be Beside Me ndash accompanied by Cathedral organist Michael McCracken.Following the service, clergy gathered at St Patrickrsquos grave for a socially distanced wreath laying ceremony.And in keeping with the focus on mental wellbeing, the wreath was laid by Mr Jackie Breen, a senior mental health nurse based at Finneston House in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24March2021-Chief.jpg","title":"Chief denies Finneston House closure claims  ","story":"THE districtrsquos most senior health chief has categorically dismissed rumours that a key facility based in Downpatrick is to close at the weekend.Finneston House mdash run by the South Eastern Trust mdash is based at the Ardglass Road on the outskirts of the town and provides an acute mental health community service.Last week, a number of councillors posted on social media that they had been made aware of reports that the facility, which has a long history as a base for mental health services, was to close at weekends with services moved to Belfast.Dispelling the rumours during a special briefing with local politicians on Monday afternoon, Mr Seamus McGoran said there were ldquoabsolutely no plans to close Finneston House which, he said, was line for a pound, investment to support the continued delivery of mental health and other community services.Mr McGoran, acting chief executive of the South Eastern Trust, said he was more than happy to set the record on the future of the mental health facility.ldquoThere are absolutely no plans at all to remove the weekend mental health service from Finneston House and relocate to Belfast, he declared.He said he was ldquosomewhat irked that some councillors had chosen to put out a statement on social media last week saying that he had received ldquodisturbing reports that the health trust was going to transfer the service.ldquoThis is absolutely not true and I would preferany of you [councillors] have issues or concerns that you would ask the Trust about them, continued Mr McGoran.ldquoWhat happens is your hear rumours and treat them as fact and start making statements on the back of that. We have an obligation to communicate responsibly with the public and we have an obligation not to create anxiety with the very people who need to access our mental health services.ldquoFinneston House will continue to be there andthere is more demand for the service it provides we will put more resources into it. That will be how we deliver the service, he said.ldquoI donrsquot know where these rumours came from and I would make a plea to please talk to us before starting putting stuff on social media. Thatrsquos how we get a constructive relationship.Mr McGoran added: ldquoWhen councillors start to put messages out asthey are factual it does not do the people we serve any good. In fact, it creates anxiety where there is no need.Confirming the planned pound, investment at Finneston House, Mrs Roisin Coulter, the health trustrsquos director of planning and performance, said that a decade ago there were plans to dispose of the facility.She said that since then, services provided there had grown and it now played an important role..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24March2021-East.jpg","title":"East Down community rejects plans%2C claims PFA  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and East Down community rejects plans to merge three local post-primary schools together, a parentsrsquo opposition group has claimed.The Red High Parents and Friends Associationndash the parent body of St Patrickrsquos Grammar School ndash has made an th hour call on the Education Minister to leave the school as it is and instead merge St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School.The call comes as the public consultation process ends on Monday into the proposed closure of all schools by September next year and the creation of a new voluntary grammar school comprising of all three schools.Red High PFA spokesperson Cormac Artt has been at the front of the parentsrsquo opposition to any merger of the grammar school over the last few years.He said that the association remained ldquosteadfast in its opposition to the development proposal agreed by each schoolrsquos trustees, the De La Salle Congregation, and the Education Authority.Mr Artt stressed the local opposition to the amalgamation of the three schools remained strong.ldquoOver this past two months, our volunteer parentsrsquo group has canvassed opinion and debate from across the locality to ensure all voices are heard in response to this proposal, he said.ldquoHundreds of parents have been in touch and it is evident the biggest shake-up in post primary education in this area for a generation has ignited our communityrsquos collective agreement this proposal falls at so many hurdles.ldquoJudging by the sheer number of contacts our parentsrsquo group has had to answer, this community firmly rejects this proposal and calls on the Minister for Education to do the right thing and scrap it.He said his group had engaged with local politicians who now fully understand the impact of development proposal and said that they had cross-party support ldquowith only a minority ignoring the facts or refusing to engage directly with parents.He continued: ldquoAs a representative parent group for St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, we fully support our Board of Governorsrsquo statement and that of our school management team. The closure of a fully sustainable school does not make any sense whatsoever and our friends at both St Maryrsquos and the De La Salle recognise this also.ldquoThis is a town plan, not an area plan as the proposal purports to be, and does not surprisingly address post primary schools in Crossgar or Ballynahinch, a move, we would suggest, to a future proposal for those schools.ldquoBut more importantly, the inequality this will create across a raft of issues, from admissions, transport, gender equality, SEN and rural needs, renders this proposal nothing less than detrimental to education in this area.ldquoWe call on the Minister for Education to retain St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in its current form and amalgamate St Maryrsquos and De La Salle Schools..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24March2021-CDiary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 28%2C 2001  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash A major review into the future of primary education provision in the greater Newcastle area could lead to the merger of up to three local schools.A review into the primary controlled sector, involving Castlewellan, Newcastle, Clough and Dundrumrsquos Downshire Primary Schools, has been launched by the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Although the investigation will not be complete until next year, principals at the smaller schools have been informed that amalgamation at a brand new green field site is a possibility.Central to the Boardrsquos thinking is continuing decline in enrolment at Downshire and the urgent need to replace Clough primary which is working to full capacity. It is understood the Board is leaning towards a merger of these two schools.DOWNPATRICK ndash A major stumbling block to the development of a new cinema in Downpatrick has been removed.Dunleath Estates has given permission for part of Dunleath Park to be redeveloped as a cinema complex, ending months of speculation about the future of the ambitious project.Proposals for the multi-screen cinema at Dunleath Park have faced delays over the past  months as the Down Council awaited legal clearance from Dunleath Estates.But at Mondayrsquos meeting of the councilrsquos Client Services Committee, it was revealed that representatives from the estate have agreed to all the land to be used for the complex, subject to restrictions.This means Dunleath Estates will remove a restrictive covenant which species that the area can only be used for recreational and leisure purposes.KILLYLEAGH ndash British Legion officials in Killyleagh have expressed concern that funding they were promised to provide a new War Memorial in the town will not be made available.Officials claim they received a letter from Down Council indicating it would ensure pound, was included in its capital programme for the new financial year, paving the way for the memorial to be provided at the top of High Street.However, Legion officials say the money has not been included in the local authority budget and are ldquodeeply disappointed at its decision, but they hope the cash will be made available next year to help them relocate the memorial, which is currently located at the side of Killyleagh Castle.Down Council has already agreed to provide the Legion with a plot of land to house the new structure, but has confirmed it cannot give a guarantee at this stage that that pound, Legion officials require will be made available.SAINTFIELD ndash All-day parkers in Saintfield have been asked to be more considerate to the townrsquos traders.The call came last Wednesday night when all day parkers were urged by Saintfield Town Committee not tothe town to what was once a major problem.Locals who attended the annual meeting, in Saintfield library, claimed that as result of people parking in Main Street for several hours each week day, traders were losing out on valuable business.Speaking after the meeting, which was also attended by local councillors William Dick and Robert Burgess, the committeersquos newly elected chairman, Mr Sam Spratt, said parking in the town had ldquogreatly improved in recent years, but warned that motorists were starting to ldquoslip back into old habits.CROSSGAR ndash The Department of Regional Development is to be asked to carry out repairs to what has been described as one of the worst roads in the Province.Down councillors have backed moves calling on the Department to have repair work carried out at the Killyleagh Road outside Crossgar which was dug up recently to allow the laying of a new sewer pipe.The work was part of a poundm scheme to allow the pumping of sewage from Crossgar for treatment in Killyleagh. But the quality of the road repairs has been called in to question by local residents and Rowallance councillor Miss Margaret Ritchie.She first raised the problem on the eve of a major report published recently by the Northern Ireland Audit Office into road openings by ious utilities, including the Water Service, Roads Service, British Telecom and ious gas companies.SEAFORDE ndash A planning decision refusing to allow the replacement of derelict buildings in Seaforde with a new housing development,has been deferred by Down Council.Councillors and Planning Service officials are to hold an office meeting to discuss the plan to demolish premises at Main Street and replace them with seven townhouses and four apartments.Planners had initially ruled that no ldquoexceptional reason had been given to justy the demolition and suggested thatallowed to proceed, the new development would be out of keeping with the general charter of existing premises in Seaforde.Planners also claimed the scheme would be contrary to rural landing policy and thatpermitted, the design, layout and landscaping of the scheme would be unacceptable.They also ruled the development would harm he privacy of adjoining residents.The building was originally listed, but it was confirmed at last weekrsquos monthly council meeting that it has since been delisted.DOWNPATRICK ndash Talks seeking a new base for Downpatrickrsquos weekly market are set to take place tomorrow morning, but stallholders are angry they have not been invited.Traders are outraged they have been excluded from the meeting between Down Council officials, the Department of the Environment and the Down Lisburn Trust, who all own part of the Lower Market Street car park where the Saturday market is currently held.It is understood the meeting is to discuss whether the weekly market can retain its current site, or have to move to free up vital spaces for visitors to the new St Patrick Centre.Traders have become increasingly hostile towards the council, claiming news of the decisions were a complete surprise as the council recently told them the market was not going to be moved.The current mood among stallholders is one of confusion and anger at the councilrsquos apparent disinterest in their welfare.ARDGLASS ndash As tougher restrictions are introduced by the European Commission in an effort to rejuvenate depleted fish stocks, one local skipper has warned that the industry is at rock bottom.Speaking just hours before the government introduced legislation banning fishing on vast stretches of local waters until April , Ardglass fisherman Paul Wills said things could not get any worse.The ban introduced at midnight on Friday was expected to be further extended yesterday during a special meeting at Stormont when the government was due to discuss a tie-up of all vessels as part of the overall cod recovery programme.Although the Ardglass industry is prawn-based, Mr Wills said local fishermen rely on their by-catch of white fish at the time of the year and said the economic consequences of the current restriction were great.Mr Wills, who skippers his own vessel, said he earns half today what he would have earned  years ago.CROSSGAR ndash The birth of the Free Presbyterian Church in Crossgar  years ago was celebrated in the village last week.The highlight of the week-long series of events to mark the churchrsquos golden anniversary came last Thursday night with a special service conducted by the Rev Fred Greenfield and the Moderator of the Free Presbyterian Church, Dr Ian Paisley.The church was pack to capacity for the service which took place a few days before Free Presbyterians from across the globe gathered for an anniversary service at Belfastrsquos Odyssey arena.The Crossgar service was

He said she declined.ldquoThis scheme has been shovel ready for some time, the MP continued.ldquoIndeed, all the geotechnical surveys, public consultations and the legal stages have been complete and in order many months ago. Yet the Minister refuses to sign-off on a commencement order.ldquoThe failure to even provide a detailed, logical explanation as to why she has not yet signed off on this scheme has created a growing fear in the local community that she is inexplicably stalling on this eagerly awaited project.The MP said that once again last weekend Ballynahinch suffered chronic congestion, with cars queued for miles to get through the town on Sunday evening as people ed home from visiting the area.Mr Hazzard warned that this will be a scene repeated each and every weekend and in the opposite direction each weeknight as commutershome from work outside Ballynahinch when Covid- restrictions ease again in the time ahead.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason, who is also calling for a start date for the bypass, said the ldquotimely delivery of the long overdue roads scheme would be a great boost for both the local economy and the wellbeing of the community.She added: ldquoThe Minister must bring this issue to a speedy conclusion as soon as possible, sign the commencement order and announce a date for construction to commence. Nothing less will be acceptable to the local community.A Department for Infrastructure spokeswoman said Mrs Mallon previously announced her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of strategic road improvement schemes delayed by the collapse of the Assembly for three years.She said these included the Ballynahinch bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.ldquoThe Ballynahinch bypass scheme is now at an advanced stage of development and a review of the environmental reports has also been completed.

Itrsquos a point that anglers disagree with.DERA explained the work on the banks of the river created two dedicated disabled parking spaces in the car park where previously there had been none.ldquoThere was no legal requirement to consult on the proposed improvement works and therefore the consultation undertaken went beyond what was required, to specically noty as well as seek comment and feedback from site users, said a departmental official.He also confirmed that notice of DAERArsquos intention to carry out improvement work was clearly displayed at the Quoile site in advance of it being undertaken.The official also confirmed that consultation on the car park investment was initiated with Newry, Mourne and Down Council and a number of local councillors who were contacted by telephone about the proposed investment.DAERA confirmed that regular tree inspections are carried out at the Quoile River and that after storms, areas of the Quoile Nature Reserve are checked by staff for fallen trees and branches that may have come down.In addition, it says this area is subject to regular visual inspections by staff and where any concerns are identied, advice will be sought from qualied tree surgeons or arboriculturists any necessary work carried out.In his letter to anglers, the DAERA official said he appreciates that it was not satisfactory for disabled anglers to make their way to access current angling facilities a quarter of a mile from the car park, confirming plans for two new educated stands to meet the needs of those with mobility problems.A spokesman for Downpatrick anglers said they have never suggested that there was a dedicated disabled fishing stand at the car park before it was redeveloped. He said fishermen could fish in the river at the car park from their wheelchairs as there was a small wall in place.ldquoSince the car park was redeveloped, a barrier has been attached to the wall which now makes it impossible for disabled anglers to fish from this location. As a result, they have to make their way, along with all their gear, to another stand which is a quarter of a mile away, he said.ldquoThis is highly unsatisfactory. Would it be proper to tell someone with mobility issues who stops in a car park to be told that the shopping centre, GP surgery or disabled toilet that they needed to visit was half a mile away  I suspect not.The spokesman added local anglers have been told about plans for disabled fishing stands at the car park for some time now and that the Environment Agency is being asked for its view.ldquoWhat we want to see is delivery for disabled anglers. They have rights which must be recognised, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoWe remain in the eye of a pandemic and mental health is a major issue for many health professionals who are concerned about the fall-out from the impact of the coronavirus. Fishing is very therapeutic and we would strongly argue that the provision of new disabled angling stands on the banks of the Quoile should be a priority and will be of tremendous benefit.Anglers have also expressed concern that the redeveloped car park on the banks of the river has become a magnet for anti-social behaviour are are thankful that no one was injured when a large branch fell to the ground several weeks ago.

The protocol has been forced upon the people of Northern Ireland and although totally rejected by the unionist population the Westminster government cast aside their supposed allegiance to the Belfast Agreement and defiantly sought to implement something that drove a coach and horses through it. To add insult to injury the government have decided to force the most rigorous abortion laws upon the people of Northern Ireland without their consent, and over the heads of the elected members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, of course once again to appease republicanism and Sinn Fein’s agenda.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...\"Lord McCrea of Magherafelt and Cookstown is a DUP peerNow we have further proof of how there are two laws being exercised within our province, again to the detriment of unionism and appeasement of republicanism. No one can deny there are two dferent policing policies being carried out in Northern Ireland. During this pandemic I and the vast majority of law abiding citizens have buried our loved ones with dignity, abiding by the rules emanating from Stormont. This has caused much added heartache and grief but because of our willingness to stop the virus and save lives we abided by the rules. Yet I know in the Mid Ulster, the deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill’s constituency and neighbourhood, we witnessed the constant breaking of these rules by republicans. There was however little or no police presence, no vehicles with cameras to gather evidence and little mention of prosecutions. For some unionists who broke the rules the police and other evidence measures were present and interviews, I believe, followed. Yesterday we witnessed the most sickening decision that there will be no prosecutions for what happened at Bobby Storey’s funeral. My view is that there was a disgraceful and blatant breach of the rules by republicans but O’Neill and the Sinn Fein leadership are not to be prosecuted The Director of Public Prosecutions should resign. It seems that the shadow of republicans ing to ‘what they know best’ hangs over the British government and we are all expected to join the policy of appeasement or remain silent. That I will not do.The unionist community has had a bellyfull of republican appeasement and the time has come when Sinn Fein has to know that unionists are not acquiescing with their agenda. It is now time for unionism to collectively say to the Westminster government and Sinn Fein that our community deserves respect and equality and that the republican agenda will be strenuously resisted both at Stormont and Westminster. The time for fine words is over and unionism will rise to the challenge.• Lord McCrea of Magherafelt and Cookstown is a DUP peer——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Boris Johnson advised public buildings, including theatres, to close and mass gatherings to stop.This week,  months on, campaign group We Make Events Cymru, reflects on the impact of Covid- and how the lockdown restrictions has had a devastating effect on their industry.The impact of the announcement back in March last year meant that the UK event sector came to an outright standstill, resulting in events being cancelled, theatre and music shows could not be staged and thousands of Welsh event professionals could not work.We Make Events Cymru, , has spent the last  months lobbying the Welsh Government to highlight the need for continued sector support in order for the events organisers, iniduals and supply chain to survive Covid- restrictions.After a year of campaigning, We Make Events Cymru continues to push for opportunities to re-open the sector in light of the Welsh Government Coronavirus Control Plan , which does not allow gatherings of more than  people in Tier .As a result of many conversations with the Welsh Government, We Make Events Cymru has created a survey to gather the much needed data to evidence the number of people involved in the sector and the contribution they make to Wales and its economy.Stephen Burkitt-Harrington, Director of Production  one of Walesrsquo leading Creative Events Companies, said: ldquoThe Welsh Government has been saying all along that it could not reopen events of any kind without industry specic data. We were surprised to learn that they were not collecting this information though.\"This is why we have put together the biggest survey of our industry ever undertaken in Wales. Companies big and small, venues, events, and every inidual involved in even the smallest way can contribute now.\"By giving us as little or as much as people are prepared to contribute, we can then provide the government with the much talked about data they say they need to see how valuable our wide ranging industry is to the Welsh economy, and how important it is to get it open again as soon as it is safe to.Alongside the survey, the group have also recently launched their own website which gives sector colleagues access to wellbeing and financial advice, access to a database of Welsh event organisers, suppliers and iniduals, as well as a forum to chat and exchange ideas ndash resources that the team believe is vitally important during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:We Make Events Cymru is in regular dialogue with Welsh Government to lobby, and is part of the working party preparing for Covid-safe outdoor and indoor test events. These test events are an integral stepping-stone to get the industry in Wales back working again .Sarah Hemsley-Cole, Director of Cardf based SC Productions and the Lead Coordinator for the campaign said: ldquoWhilst we have to accept large mass gatherings are not possible in  ndash it is essential that we keep up the pressure on Welsh Government to allow covid safe cultural activities in the Summer of .\"We are a creative and innovative sector, and by working with Welsh Government to develop appropriate guidance and to generate factual data and evidence from the test events, we can get performers, artists, technicians and the eco system back to work and audiences back to what they love.Working alongside partners such as Equity, Creu Cymru, BECTU, Cardf Music Board, Cult Cymru, Freelancers Make Theatre Work Freelances Task Force, What About Weddings and The Musicians Union ndash We Make Events Cymru has helped give the industry and events people a crucial voice during these unprecedented times.Following on from the recent budget announcement, We Make Events Cymru acknowledge the essential package of support already received from the UK and Welsh governments, and is pleased to hear of the further support expected with the extension of furlough, additional SEISS grants ndash which now includes newcomers to the industry who started their businesses in the   tax year, as well as the Cultural Recovery Fund.We Make Events Cymru are now waiting to hear about additional financial aid and get a better understanding of how long this relief money is expected to last business and iniduals in Wales. There are still thousands across the country who have been excluded from any kind of financial support ndash these people need to be recognised and also offered funding.The campaign group is also calling for the events industry to be considered on a par with other industries like hospitality and the Film and TV sector for things such as insurance and financial schemes.The UK is internationally recognised for delivering impressive cultural events. Within it, Wales plays a signicant role with its tremendous highly skilled workforce, many of whom have now had to ersy to work in other jobs.The impact of the lockdown will be felt within the Welsh events industry for many years to come. Rhys Maule, Managing Director of ProLX Productions in Cwmbran said: ldquoThe loss of extremely talented, hard working and dedicated professionals is really hard to see.\"These people are being backed into a corner as a result of no support and canrsquot see any way out other than to change career and move onto something more secure. Lots of these people feel they may neveras the risk is too great, which is devastating, and the impact on their metal health as a result of this is hard to hear.He added ldquoThe huge number of people falling through the gaps not receiving funding is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency to ensure the future of our industry.The COVID- pandemic has caused many events around Wales and the UK to be cancelled or postponed due the government-imposed restrictions on large gatherings. Among the most prominent events to be affected in Wales in  have been the National Eisteddfod, the Royal Welsh Show, Hay Festival, Abergavenny Food Festival, Cardf Half Marathon, Llangollen International Eisteddfod, Green Man and Ironman. Many of these have also been postponed for .In August  event organisations from across the UK joined forces to bring attention to the critical condition of the live events industry by lighting venues and iconic buildings in red. Wales Millennium Centre, Motorpoint Arena Cardf, Pontio,Venue Cymru and Aberystwyth Arts Centre were just some of the venues that lent their support to the campaign.We Make Events Cymru is calling on anyone who contributes to events in Wales and its eco-system to complete the survey in order to evidence the valuable contribution the sector makes in Wales.For more information about the survey, visit: https:www.wemakeevents.cymru . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I canrsquot see any reason why that wouldnrsquot be being spoken about now.ldquoPerhaps therersquos something we donrsquot know. If that is the case, then come out and say it because none of us want a third wave ndash that would kill businesses. The critical thing is we can have an uninterrupted summer.Is he expecting the high numbers some of his customers are predicting this weekend ldquoYes, probably ndash there has been a buzz since they let people travel locally, so Irsquod expect another rise in numbers again.ldquoWe need to be careful for our residents. We are a public service and we donrsquot want to cause trouble. Traders have got to remember that.Residents and friends Tracey Scott and Debra Cooper have enjoyed visiting the unusually quiet beach at weekdays through the pandemic, but said they will avoid the seafront this weekend.ldquoI hope people continue to be weary, Ms Scott, who lives alone at her home in Llandough, said. ldquoBut it seems to me recently people have stopped social distancing as much.ldquoI come here with friends and family sometimes three times a week, but I have to avoid it on weekends now.ldquoThere are just hordes of people not keeping to social distancing rules. Itrsquos a great shame.ldquoI walked with my mother here not long ago and was being bumped into by people. I canrsquot put myself at risk, and I canrsquot put others at risk.ldquoItrsquos so dficult because I live alone and I keep away from people Irsquod very much like to hug. Then someone comes and brushes past me. I know it sounds odd, but you do feel almost violated when that happens.ldquoItrsquos dficult, because I really do want the businesses to thrive here and I would like to support them on the weekends.ldquoMy message to people would be lsquogive it time, and letrsquos play it safe ndash donrsquot all rush at oncersquo.Ms Scottrsquos son and his partner, in their twenties, are also avoiding weekend trips to the seafront due to her son having asthma.Ms Cooper said: ldquoFor months now Irsquove only gone out in the week because it gets so busy. Itrsquos strange ndash the nice weather comes and the residents keep out the way.Hugh Pickford, who owns Pickfordrsquos Gallery and Bar With Rooms on the seafront, says he feels for residents, and itrsquos become dficult for traders to police overcrowding.ldquoItrsquos probably bred by us not being able to open indoors and police the situation ourselves, he said.Social distancing signs remain after the road had to be temporarily closed due to people packing the Esplanade over ChristmasldquoAt the moment people come and get a takeaway and go across the road. The problem is thatrsquos what everyone is doing. It doesnrsquot look great at times. But what can we do ldquoOver Christmas it looked almost like a carnival atmosphere to be honest.ldquoIrsquod like to look on the bright side. The seafront has really seen a revival in the last couple of years. Even at am now Piotr at Stol Coffee draws a crowd here. Itrsquos nice to see.That revival is continuing this weekend too as a new cafeacute opens inside the Pier Pavilion.The new rules mean the Pickfords can open their rooms to all people in Wales again.Hugh PickfordldquoWersquove not had much interest at the moment in the rooms, he said. ldquoPeople booked for April and then cancelled when they realised it was room service only. People donrsquot seem to want to eat off the premises or in their rooms, so thatrsquos hitting us a bit.ldquoWersquore looking forward to the summer. With staycation season likely to be ahead of us, it should be a great place to be.What you saidResidents have been responding when asked what they thought of the new changes.Jo Broad, from Blackwood, predicted: ldquoPeople will go crazy. Of course we need our lives back or at least some sort of normality. The beaches will be full again.ldquoLetrsquos hope people will be sensible, not go crazy, and letrsquos hope for safety, or I think there might be a summer lockdown coming.Newport resident Lisa Edwards said: ldquoPeople need to stop hiding behind the government. We are in charge of our own destiny and we have to resume some normality.ldquoTo do this, we need to be allowed to resume living, but sensibly. Itrsquos people flouting new rules that will cause a second wave.Claire Dunning said: ldquoWaiting for the next lockdown. People will take liberties.

High-profile figures, including a number of professional footballers, have highlighted racist abuse they have received online. Former Arsenal and France striker Thierry Henry recently announced he was quitting social media over abuse, saying it is not a ldquosafe place.Social media giants have remained silent in the wake of the report, however Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, said it would not be commenting on the review, while Twitter and Google-owned YouTube did not respond to a request for comment..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Government and social media urged to do more to tackle online racism article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...
