In an effort to curb the spread of the disease, some states quarantined citizens others made the wearing of face masks mandatory, at the same time as shutting down “all places of amusement”. According to a law passed in San Francisco in October of that year, on the day that state-wide infections passed 50,000, anyone seen not wearing a gauze face covering was subject to fines that ranged from $5 to $100 and the possibility of 10 days’ imprisonment.The order appeared to work in “flattening the curve” of infection in San Francisco other American states took up the practice, which was also promoted across the Atlantic in Paris and in Manchester. Supply quickly became an issue, so in America churches and community groups organised mass mask-making sessions. When the order was lifted at noon on the last day of November, a blaring whistle sounded and, the San Francisco Chronicle noted, people threw off their masks leaving “the sidewalks and runnels strewn with the relics of a tortuous month”.The relaxation of the law proved premature. As the death toll rose again in a third wave of the disease – and despite the protests of the newly formed Anti-Mask League – mandatory mask-wearing was reintroduced for another six weeks at the beginning of the following year.

It ran from a Basepoint business centre in Swindon, a shared office building managed by International Workplace Group (IWG), the world’s largest flexible workspace provider.Desperately trying to cut costs, the Humphreys contacted IWG to ask for support, but initially did not receive any. “Their attitude towards helping us was not very good at all,” says Carl.A similar offer has been made to many of IWG’s tenants, who rent office space managed by the company under brand names including Basepoint, Regus and Spaces. Businesses have also been offered the option of paying half-rent for two months, and repaying the rest over the following year.These offers, described as “reasonable” by the group’s chief executive, Mark Dixon, have not stopped the criticism levelled at IWG by its tenants for its perceived lack of communication and support.Locked out of their offices owing to government travel restrictions, IWG’s customers complain that requests for rent reductions or deferments were initially ignored as the group insisted full rent was due because its buildings remained open for key workers and to maintain customer services such as mail delivery and IT.More than 1,000 people have signed a petition calling for IWG to close all of its 312 UK centres and freeze all rent or memberships, or provide “substantial discounts”.For James Vanner, a partner at the London law firm Vanner Perez Notaries which rents 50 sq metres of Regus office space, IWG’s behaviour during the crisis amounts to “unethical profiteering”. He adds that he has tasked an agent with finding a new office.As recently as the start of March, IWG, previously known as Regus, was trumpeting a “transformational year” and record profits.Now the group, which is headquartered in Switzerland and has more than 3,300 locations in 110 countries, is negotiating rental payments with its own landlords.One institutional landlord says IWG has failed to pay it any rent for the last quarter.Dixon insists the group has not been requesting rent reductions from its UK commercial landlords. “What we are getting in some cases is deferments of rent, in a small number of cases. We are not asking for anything more than that,” he says.Dixon describes the UK property industry’s reaction as “disappointing”, adding: “This is a time when businesses have to work together, it’s not a time for conflict.”The Monaco-based executive says he has spoken personally to hundreds of IWG customers and received “hundreds of thank you notes for helping”, but criticises certain customers, who he says could afford to pay rent, for trying to “take advantage of a situation”.These firms, including the troubled US company WeWork, tend to sign long leases for buildings from their landlords, while renting out the space on much shorter terms to their customers.IWG noted this “potential mismatch” between leases and contracts as a strategic risks in most recent full-year results, published in March.Mike Prew, an equity analyst at brokerage firm Jefferies, describes the share prices of IWG and its rival Workspace Group as the “canary in the mineshaft – or perhaps on the hot desk”.IWG is exploring raising cash by selling some of the buildings it owns, which it gained through several acquisitions, and leasing them back. But Dixon insists these plans are “not imminent” and date from “well before Covid-19”.Challenges may remain for IWG and other shared workspace providers even as coronavirus restrictions are eased and some businesses can return to their offices.He is concerned flexible workspace providers may be left exposed. “You’re going to have a pretty aggressive flex office industry offering really good deals to attract companies back,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70ff0df76f187d27ad78c5c2795c8cb50d41fd31/0_200_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a2a5062226195a11fb1c838eda2018a","title":"covid 19 reset hong kong crackdown continues democracy","story":"The government has shown that even in a pandemic, it’s determined to suppress demands for meaningful democracyHong Kong is living through two traumas at once: after nine months of civil unrest – sparked by a now-aborted extradition law – that saw increasing violence from protesters and the police force, the former British colony was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.The territory has been faring relatively well so far (with 1,041 confirmed cases and four deaths at the time of writing), in large part thanks to the scarring experience of Sars in 2003. This meant that as soon as news of a novel strain of coronavirus in mainland China started to spread, most people decided not to wait for official guidelines and began wearing masks, minimising social outings, and washing hands and homes with increased frequency and thoroughness.The government, on the other hand, prevaricated for reasons that were hardly connected to public health. Back in October 2019, citing colonial-era emergency laws, the authorities banned wearing a mask in public to prevent protesters hiding their identity as they took part in unauthorised marches (or authorised marched that got banned halfway through). But the administration wasn’t willing to budge. It took a few contradictory press briefings before Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, accepted that surgical masks for preventing the spread of the coronavirus would be allowed – while maintaining that they would remain forbidden at protests.To some extent, the pandemic could have given the Hong Kong government the opportunity to reset the clock, concentrate on protecting public health, and move towards social reconciliation. This is not what’s happened.Even as Hong Kong was recording growing numbers of new infections and life was being upended by the pandemic, the police kept making arrests and the courts kept putting activists on trial. Fifteen high-profile activists were arrested in April for illegal assembly in a march that took place last August that saw more than a million people take to the streets. Among them were pro-democracy veterans such as Martin Lee, 81, a senior barrister who co-drafted the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, and who served as an elected legislator and as one of the founders of the Democratic party Jimmy Lai, the founder and publisher of pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily and Figo Chan, co-convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, the group that had been leading authorised mass protests throughout 2019.In the same hours, the Liaison Office, Beijing’s highest representative in Hong Kong, decided to make its position in the territory even more openly that of a de facto supervisor of the local administration by announcing that it was not bound by Article 22 of the Basic Law. Article 22 states that no department under the Chinese central and local government may interfere in Hong Kong’s internal affairs. The announcement seemingly undermined some of the main principles under which Hong Kong exists – such as the “one country, two systems” concept and the promise of a high degree of autonomy – but it didn’t provoke street protests: the fear of a spread of coronavirus cases, and the impossibility of organising rallies or meetings, has meant that discontent has migrated online, mostly on social media. Since the end of March, social distancing has been enforced with a provision that forbids groups of more than four people gathering, making demonstrations almost impossible.But as the crackdown continues, an angry emoji can only go so far. Law Man-chung, an anti-government protester, saw his sentence of 200 hours of community service changed to 20 days in prison after the government appealed the original sentence for being “too lenient”. His crime? Trampling and throwing a Chinese flag in the bin. In the same week, a judge expressed sympathy with a man who stabbed two young protesters and a reporter with a meat cleaver . And while the person who carried out the assault received a sentence of less than four years, Edward Leung, 28, a proponent of Hong Kong’s independence, lost his appeal against a six-year jail sentence for throwing bricks at police during a 2016 clash at which police used live rounds.The new round of legal repression comes in between two crucial elections. Last November both the local and central authorities were taken by surprise when the district council elections – normally a minor political event, as district councillors are tasked with taking care of local issues – resulted in 17 out of 18 local councils going to the pro-democracy camp. This watershed moment clearly hasn’t brought about a more open-minded approach towards Hong Kong’s demands: the authorities want to prevent a similar result in this September’s legislative council elections (which are half-returned by universal suffrage).In the past week, though, protests have returned: they have mostly been taking place in shopping malls, where people can gather less visibly and then start chanting slogans while maintaining the decreed social distancing rules. On 1 May, Labour Day, after the police refused to authorise a traditional rally, a protest inside a mall ended in arrests and the use of pepper spray. The government has shown that it is not interested in reconciliation and even through a pandemic has stuck to its guns, continuing to refer to protesters as “rioters”, no matter what they do. The demand for meaningful democracy is treated like a second virus to be forcibly driven out of Hong Kong.• Ilaria Maria Sala is a writer and journalist based in Hong Kong"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b238291fbd0d3cc9046867b4d22ee39e151d7ce/0_0_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=949eb1c32bbd81014148e13ed1559c6c","title":"covid 19 world poorest countries aid relief package","story":"Without $90bn in aid we will see soaring conflict, poverty, hunger and global instability. But a relief package is viableAs iniduals, families, industries and nations plot their course through this pandemic, there is a painful truth that is yet to be properly acknowledged. The Covid-19 pandemic – and the resulting global recession – is going to have a devastating and destabilising effect in the world’s poorest countries.In response, wealthy countries and international financial institutions will need to fundamentally shift their approach to aid and debt. This cannot be business as usual. Extraordinary measures are needed to tackle the extraordinary problem we face.For rich countries, that will mean a one-off increase in the amount they spend on foreign aid. For the international financial institutions it means changing their lending terms. The alternative is dealing with the spill-over effects for many years to come. That would prove even more painful, and much more expensive. For everyone.There are many things we do not know about coronavirus, but it is possible to assess some of the costs of the necessary response in the poorest countries, and how they can be met.In the poorest countries we should be ready for a rise in conflict, hunger and poverty. The spectre of multiple famines looms. We can already see economies contracting as export earnings, remittances and tourism disappear. As countries with weak health systems attempt to fight the virus, we can expect an increase in measles, malaria, cholera and other disease as vaccinations are put on hold, health systems buckle under the strain and medical supply chains are disrupted.About two-thirds of it could come from organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. They will need support to change the terms on which they help the most vulnerable countries: front-loading money, reduced interest rates and further debt relief.An increase in money spent overseas may be an uncomfortable thought for countries battling the virus at home. These are countries where many people are losing their freedoms, their jobs and their loved ones and countries making significant sacrifices while facing an uncertain future. But it is precisely at this moment when those sacrifices are starting to pay off, and as those countries seek to reopen their economies, it makes sense also to support the most vulnerable.Recent history shows us that what happens in the world’s most fragile places has knock-on effects, whether it’s through uncontrolled migration, terrorism or global instability. Leaving the virus to spread unchecked in the world’s most fragile countries, and free to circle back round the world, is in no one’s interest. Nor is economic collapse and instability in the poorest nations.In a week in which people in some parts of the world have been given cause for optimism, we have seen how the extraordinary actions of iniduals can change the trajectory for a whole nation. The same is true on a global level."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7a1f731c1ba3bc5d32938a1cf6d3a83707ec5fe/0_125_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2705d61c79986f433537bb73b524c3ca","title":"parent vulnerable child coronavirus school ","story":"Coronavirus makes it unsafe for my daughter to go to school, but the strain of caring for her at home is overwhelmingEvery vulnerable child has access to school during lockdown, right?Our daughter, Liora Sarnaik, age 13, has an education and health care plan and a social worker, so meets the government’s definition of vulnerable and should have been able to go to school when lockdown started. I actually thought I might be one of those people who work from home, learn how to bake a cake, sort through the attic, have Zoom chats. But Liora hasn’t been at school.Today there are only 15 children attending Liora’s excellent special needs school, Downs View in Brighton. Normally there are more than 100. Liora is not one of the 15: these are all children who live in residential care because their families have not been able to cope with caring for them. So they don’t have a choice about going to school.Liora has three life-long conditions: uncontrolled epilepsy, a chronic kidney condition and autism. She can’t speak and she’s doubly incontinent. She’s beautiful, upbeat and humorous and her father, Rahul, and I adore her.I desperately want to send her to school because without it she is home full-time and needs someone to care for her, all day every day, from the moment she gets up to the moment she sleeps, no weekends off. My last day off was before lockdown.So why are we not sending her to school? On the first day of the lockdown, I spoke to a school staff member on the phone. “It’s up to you, of course, but I wouldn’t send her,” he said. “I can’t see how it can be safe.”Many of the pupils, like Liora, don’t have language, they can’t speak or understand more than simple words such as food, drink, toilet. The majority have saliva issues they dribble and wipe their mouths on any available person or surface. They don’t know how to wipe their noses, they are not able to wash their hands without help – and often resist it. They don’t know how to social distance, they don’t know anything about the pandemic. Many are also violent to parents and teachers and they are not able to stop biting, punching and kicking. Liora is not violent to others, but she is to herself, banging her own head with her fists when in pain or frustrated. She needs close physical contact at all times to be cared for properly.Liora’s headteacher, Adrian Carver, says if he lets more children into school, they could simply die of contracting coronavirus. These are his words, not mine, because it will be impossible to keep them – and his staff – safe. He’s having to turn desperate parents away, which he hates doing, as he knows how hard it is for us.It’s pretty glib, then, of the government to announce that all children meeting the vulnerable criteria will receive an education. Clearly he has no understanding that thousands of disabled children can’t go to school, and thousands of families in utter crisis are having to care for their children full-time. The Disabled Children’s Partnership has just launched a survey focusing on the “hidden” lives of families with disabled children during lockdown the findings will be announced some time in May, and I expect there will be many stories like mine.Parents like myself can’t provide what a school can offer. We have constant big challenges with personal care, with behaviour, and with sleep deprivation, as our children are often up in the night. As well as being on the receiving end of violence. “Today I’ve been punched, kicked, had an umbrella smacked around my head, been screamed at, he’s smashed up the house AGAIN,” a parent wrote on one of my WhatsApp groups. Without school, it’s not only our children who are vulnerable, it’s the whole family: siblings hide in their rooms to get away from the behaviour, parents are close to breakdown. Liora’s father and I have a sense that we are expected to just suck it up. So what do we need? I want recognition at the highest level for families caring for their disabled children. I want to know that, if Liora’s dad and I fail to survive looking after her full-time, there will be a place for her in residential care, a place she can be safe. However, there are no places in residential care in normal times, never mind in lockdown.And I want professional carers to be valued and paid properly for their extremely specialist skills caring for children like Liora. Skilled carers leave their jobs because their wages are so low. Us parents are in a constant fight with each other, first to get carers and then to keep them – we are like rats in a trap. It’s about recognition. It’s about not being forgotten.• Beverley Cohen is a carer for her daughter and a media manager"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45aa18ef24426ad561b345f765a5eb8ca0e9b407/0_177_4447_2669/master/4447.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f8ca7ce6f7d549705fe45f7e4a3136c","title":"wealth key workers pandemic ambulance worker","story":"One ambulance worker’s story shows how the poor and powerless are far more likely to die despite our country’s prosperityEveryone can see it now. The coronavirus pandemic has worn away the thin veneer of prosperity that covered the rusty and battered British state – revealing that, whatever exceptional wealth exists in our society, it is useless in a crisis. What is the point of wealth if a country cannot provide protective equipment for its own doctors and nurses?The virus itself is only the official cause of what is on course to be the highest death toll in Europe: there are other underlying conditions, including the incompetence of this government and the self-destructive austerity imposed by its predecessors. But even if the government had locked down sooner, many never stood a chance. The poor, the underpaid and the disempowered have neither the labour rights nor the ability to protect themselves from the virus by self-isolating or defying employers who have not extended sufficient protection. The disparities are already coming into focus. People in deprived areas are dying at twice the rate  of those in affluent ones. Black and ethnic minority people, who are more likely to be employed in high-risk key worker roles, are dying at higher rates than the overall population. Many of these deaths have been the result of brutal structural inequality.This fatal systemic imbalance in our society can be seen most starkly by examining the deaths of care and health workers. Consider the case of Abdul Gellaledin, an ambulance care assistant in Kingston, south-west London. His job was to take patients from their homes, and care and nursing homes, to hospital and back. His family told me that he had been worried since the start of the pandemic: many of the patients he and his colleagues were transporting lived in care homes where the virus was spreading, and his requests for any form of protective gear had been refused by his employers.One day in March, he was sent with one colleague to pick up a patient from hospital. They found the patient unaccompanied in a wheelchair, and coughing. When they raised concerns, they were told by a nurse she had tested negative for Covid-19. They took her home, only to realise that she needed to be carried upstairs as she had no carer at the time Gellaledin tried to avert his face while the patient coughed. They were not told that any physical assistance would be required, and were consequently unprepared they were also not told that another ambulance crew had already declined the assignment on the grounds it was not safe. The patient later tested positive. On 9 April, Gellaledin died of coronavirus. He was 53.Gellaledin’s death is the result of a number of converging trends that have been growing for decades, and which have disproportionately claimed the lives of those at the sharp end of society’s inequalities. The ambulance he staffed was outsourced to a private company to help an underfunded NHS ambulance service – an arrangement that persists even after other private companies have been stripped of their contracts for poor performance after undercutting competitors on pricing. This race to the bottom meant that, when Gellaledin asked for personal protective equipment (PPE), he was not even given gloves, says his family.His employer, Falck UK Ambulance Services, is the British arm of the Danish group Falck. According to the company’s 2018 annual report, profitability had improved in its ambulance business unit as a result of “efficiency and cost-optimisation initiatives and an improved contract portfolio”. The CEO of Falck UK, Mark Raisbeck, maintains that: “All of our crews, including Abdul, have at all times been issued with PPE in full compliance with Public Health England guidelines.” He adds that it is “currently undertaking a full investigation in partnership with our NHS colleagues”. After Gellaledin’s death, Falck UK’s chief operating officer, Craig Smith, sent an email to staff calling for a minute’s silence to pay respects to their fallen colleague, a man of a “respectful nature” who had a “caring manner”. There was no mention of Gellaledin’s cause of death at the end of 11 days in a medically induced coma.There comes a point when we must stop and appraise what it means to be a civilised country, what it means to be a wealthy one. That point is when a man who is carrying the aged, the sick and the vulnerable has to keep showing up to work despite worrying that he is not receiving basic protection in a pandemic. That point is when a nation’s health service is so cash-strapped that it has to hire private companies whose worst case scenario isn’t the needless death of a worker it’s a loss to shareholders.The economic prosperity we have in the UK has been accumulated through years of aggressive liberalisation and privatisation, sacrificing the health, safety, dignity and lives of others. To Britain’s vulnerable precariat, this has been apparent for a long time. To them, the crisis was always here. As their deaths swell Britain’s mortality toll, we can no longer look at ourselves as a nation and see any metric of affluence that we should be proud of. With every death that could have been avoided – because the systems that could have prevented them have been expunged by austerity – we should ask ourselves, what is our national wealth for?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e140128550ee7874529d3d135f84d4dcdbaf708/0_151_5877_3526/master/5877.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ce9083e1f107df97cd2e40fdddbf251","title":"revealed year six primary school pupils may return on 1 june","story":"Boris Johnson set to announce 10- and 11-year-olds will be first to attend when schools reopenGovernment scientific advisers are examining the impact of letting children in their final year of primary school return to classrooms from 1 June, the  has learned.Boris Johnson is due to announce next Sunday that year six children, aged 10 and 11, will be the first cohort allowed back into schools since he announced their closure on 18 March, to be closely followed by other primary school years, and years 10 and 12 in secondary schools.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is said to be focusing on allowing back older primary school children initially, with the year group deemed a priority because of their need to transition to secondary school in September.Downing Street confirmed that 1 June after the half-term holiday was its target – subject to the latest data on the spread of Covid-19 – and that the prime minister would make a significant announcement on Sunday offering a roadmap out of the lockdown. Sage is expected to meet on Tuesday.Both Johnson and Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, made public comments on the need for schools to quickly reopen in some form.Drakeford said schools in Wales could also reopen at the beginning of next month. “Our advice from the trade unions and from the local education authorities is that you will need three weeks as a minimum from the point that we decide to do that, to when schools can reopen, so we are talking about the beginning of June,” he told the BBC.But Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser who has set up an alternative experts’ group to rival Sage, warned school reopening would have to be “watched very carefully”. King said he thought June was too early but wanted to discuss the issue with his expert panel on Monday.Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), which represents most primary school teachers, called on the government to detail how it would protect children, teachers and families.He said: “While we all want to see a return to some sort of normality, the NEU believes it’s really premature to talk about a June return date. Instead, the government should be providing evidence about how this can be safe, how many more fatalities would we expect to see amongst school staff and parents and how these can be prevented or minimised.”Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said parents and the public wanted a decision made on robust scientific evidence, particularly on infection and transmission rates for different age groups. Last week a study from Germany found children were as likely to spread coronavirus as adults.“There will be huge practical difficulties to solve, for example the much reduced workforce available due to illness and shielding, and the difficulty of achieving social distancing in schools, especially amongst the very young and on the school gate,” Whiteman said.Sharon Waldron, the headteacher of Stonham Aspal Church of England primary school in Suffolk, said she favoured rotating year groups into schools for a week at a time, starting with year six in the first week after the May half-term holiday.“I feel schools will try their best to implement a way through this situation whatever is asked of them, but I worry that if the plan is too much, too fast we could see a few terrible scenarios: increased rate of R, increased deaths of children and school staff,” Waldron said.R, or the \u0027effective reproduction number\u0027, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity.\u0026nbspSeveral countries, such as Austria and Denmark, have moved to partially reopen schools as coronavirus fears have receded. But in some of the worst-hit areas of the globe, including Italy and parts of the US, schools will remain shut until the end of summer.Any decision by Johnson would only apply directly to schools in England. Education policy and funding is devolved to national administrations, meaning schools in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland can reopen independently of what happens in England.Eithne Hughes, the director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: “We would caution against fixing a date in stone at this stage, and to make sure the conditions are right first of all. We are happy to plan towards a proposed date, but we would urge that it is clearly stated from the outset that it is moveable if more time is needed.“Exactly how this is managed will need to be guided by public health and scientific advice to ensure that pupils, parents and staff can have confidence that it is safe to return to schools. This will be a complex and difficult task, and there is a great deal of work to do to get this right. That is why the date of reopening must be kept under review.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbdedce9f900afa66a9ba8e6c26560cc34a13ca6/2873_1735_5055_3033/master/5055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a13350d570cf933e1f16f351375ebce","title":"i cant get motivated the students struggling with online learning","story":"As universities shift online, experts worry that disadvantaged and disabled students may slip through the cracksLoretta Charles-Cregan, an 18-year-old A-level student, considers herself lucky because her school gave her a laptop to help her do her GCSEs when she was made temporarily homeless after her house flooded. “It’s the only reason I can do my work now,” she says. “It was a blessing in disguise.”Many students from low-income families like Charles-Cregan’s lack the basic technology they need to study online, including access to a laptop and a reliable broadband connection, along with a quiet place in which to work and complete assessments. But as universities rapidly gear up to deliver their courses online in September if social distancing measures continue, some students are worried about how they will cope.The prospect is already influencing Charles-Cregan’s decision-making. While she still plans to attend university in September, the coronavirus crisis has made her consider choosing her offer at a London university to stay closer to her home in Ilford. But this wouldn’t solve the problem of how to actually do her work.“It’s made me a bit more anxious,” she says. “We have the cheapest WiFi, it drops all the time. When I was doing A-levels I went to the library instead, but you can’t do that now. And there’s a lot of us in one house, my family’s quite big, so it’s not somewhere I can get motivated for work.”Social mobility experts are warning that the shift to online learning could severely hold back some students, including those from poorer backgrounds, care leavers, students with caring responsibilities and those with disabilities. A National Union of Students survey suggested that one fifth of students struggle with access, while over half of students who rely on assistive technology felt they lacked the support needed to continue learning.The NUS is now pressuring universities to better accommodate struggling students through a national approach to exams and assessment. “The most impacted are already the most disadvantaged. This makes no sense when there are solutions available to help them and all students,” says Claire Sosienski-Smith, NUS vice-president for higher education.“We’ve got to be really careful that digital provision doesn’t compound the inequalities we already see in the educational system,” agrees Anne-Marie Canning, chief executive of social mobility charity The Brilliant Club.One solution, Canning says, would be for universities should redirect general bursaries aimed at low income students towards kitting them out with the devices they need for online learning.Some universities are already starting to do this: York has set up a philanthropic fund to support students with online learning, Coventry is exploring making courses accessible by mobile phone, and one other university plans to provide all its disadvantaged students with WiFi dongles.But Emma Hardy, the shadow universities minister, says that these hardship loans can be difficult for students to access. “They’re limited, bureaucratic and very difficult to get paid out,” she says.Challenges for disadvantaged students extend beyond access to technology. According to research from 2017, these students consistently perform worse through online learning than they do in face-to-face classrooms. “Taking online courses increases their likelihood of dropping out,” the authors wrote.Chris Skidmore, the former universities minister, warns that these students already struggle with feelings of belonging and are already more likely to drop out of university.“Remote learning must not allow these groups of students to become ever more remote,” he says. “We can’t afford for care-leavers, estranged pupils, and those from vulnerable and deprived backgrounds to miss out on their potential.”Lucy Gill-Simmen, a lecturer at Royal Holloway University, has offered Zoom catchups to all 70 of her personal tutees to make sure they are coping with the shift to online. “It has a huge impact on my workload,” she says.But she considers it essential to support her students’ mental health. She’s noticed that some are struggling with the lack of a designated study space and proper equipment. “That demotivates them, they don’t feel they’re able to get up and get working.”Disabled students are also finding support patchy. Piers Wilkinson, NUS disabled students officer, says that although the Disabled Student Allowance funds laptops, it doesn’t cover everything.“People like myself and others that did computer-based modelling or music and media can’t run the fundamental pieces of software that are required by their degree. So they would have to use the specialist IT suites in their department or university library. With those being closed, they’ve lost access to that.”Wilkinson adds that although disabled students have been asking universities to roll out lecture capture for years, many have been slow to do this, and staff have not been trained on how to make video content accessible and inclusive.Deaf students in particular find it difficult to lip-read on screens and understand seminars in which multiple people are speaking, and report that many universities do not yet supply subtitles or a British sign language interpreter. Autistic students say they are struggling with the anxiety caused by new systems.One student from Kingston University, who has dyslexia and dyspraxia, says she is struggling to cope. “I have challenges with coordinating and I find using the online portals unfriendly. It takes me a long time to work it out, and this is not factored in when sessions start,” she says. “I’m finding the entire ordeal very stressful and I have emailed lecturers, but I’ve received no reply.”A Kingston University spokesperson said: “Students are able to access learning materials through the university’s easily accessible virtual learning environment, Canvas, which is functioning as normal, and we are making additional adjustment for students with statement of special needs, including making available assistive technology and human support during the assessment period.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2632bf740089a7cfe7421d35ea988dcf380930/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b34bcb0c1d8d115e766b740262ac5c7","title":"teachers and parents how do you feel about schools reopening","story":"We’d like to hear from people about the expected return to schools, whether to teach or take their childrenPrime minister Boris Johnson is due to announce on Sunday that children aged 10 and 11 will be the first cohort allowed back into schools from 1 June.

Less was known about the global pandemic the data and scientific research showing how the two global crises are linked was not as clear is it is today. But the connections quickly became obvious to Atkin, founder of the climate newsletter and podcast Heated. “Both are global crises which threaten millions of lives with clear science on how to solve them which governments have been too slow to act on the same people who promote climate denial are refusing to accept the science of coronavirus, too.“Coronavirus makes climate change worse, and vice versa,” Atkin says from isolation in her apartment. “We can’t do our research on climate because of it, we’ve had to cancel the UN climate summit for international negotiations.” Meanwhile, Donald Trump has loosened existing emission regulations during the pandemic, yet studies are already finding that death rates are “significantly higher” in areas with worse air pollution levels. The destruction of bioersity makes pandemics more likely. And just like with the impact of global heating, , the coronavirus is hitting black, brown and poor people the worst.The two things are so connected, Atkin repeats, that it’s stupid to say they’re not.Raised in New York and based in Washington DC, Atkin started reporting on the climate in 2013 after graduating in journalism from CUNY (the City University of New York) but three years in she was burnt out. “I was forced to write in this really straight way with no emotion, just fact,” she says of her time spent at the now closed liberal news site ThinkProgress and then a more conservative TV network. “We ran stories which focused on ‘balance’ in a bid not to alienate audiences.” When facts were presented, it was to be done without emotion: the science shows we’ll kill people if we don’t do anything, we’re not doing anything, end report.Climate-change deniers were also being given airtime on TV segments she was producing. She recalls being asked to rerecord a voiceover because she sounded “too judgmental” when stating what had been said by an interviewee wasn’t scientifically correct. And, with editors regularly giving science and opinion equal value, all too often Atkin felt she was doing a disservice to her beat.“I thought back to my journalism classes and how we were taught the first rule in the Society of Professional Journalists’ code of ethics is to seek truth and report it.” Atkin came to the realisation that when it comes to the climate crisis, showing what is true requires more than facts alone.“The truth is full of emotions, money and power,” she says. “It’s about people dying while others profit, the impact on lives and culture and jobs.” Atkin had told the climate story again and again but felt she was making little impact. “It seemed so irresponsible for me to be working as a journalist… without being explicit about what will happen if we don’t lower carbon emissions, and fast.”And so in September last year she left her reporting job at New Republic and launched Heated: a climate-focused newsletter which aimed at speaking directly to an ever-growing, but under-served, environmentally-conscious audience. Atkin quickly found launching her own platform didn’t just offer her editorial freedom, but her more emotive and in-depth output was giving her subscribers more confidence to talk all things climate in their daily lives.“I’ve had so many emails from readers telling me how before Heated the idea of speaking abut climate change to friends, family and colleagues made them anxious,” says Atkin. “Social science shows the best thing we can do as iniduals on climate change is to speak about it, but it’s so controversial in the US that many people felt if difficult questions were asked they wouldn’t be prepared.”Her paying subscribers have an expectation of regularly delivered content, and when the pandemic worsened she was struggling to write about the relationship between coronavirus and the climate crisis in a coherent and digestible way. “If I do a podcast, I thought, I could work it out as we go along by talking to really smart people,” she says. The moment matched the medium, and the Heated podcast was quickly launched.She has interviewed the veteran US environmentalist Bill McKibben, Harvard’s interim director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment Dr Aaron Bernstein, and a host of her fellow climate journalists. Her response to Planet of the Humans, Michael Moore’s controversial climate documentary (“a bad faith insult to all the work climate and energy scholars, journalists and activists have done in the last ten years”) makes compelling listening.The first episode, however, opens with Atkin offering her own realisation: that living through the coronavirus has changed her thinking on whether inidual action on climate, rather than only big business, politicians and the world’s most powerful, has a significant role to play.“Every day now I take an inidual action to help protect people: staying at home, wearing a mask, sanitising my hands, avoiding my friends and family,” says Atkin. “And that’s not just to protect people physically, but to show everyone around me that I care about this problem too.”Seeing how quickly most of us have adapted our lives to respond to the Covid-19 crisis and encouraged our peers to follow has been a lesson in the potential of virtue-signalling. Public pressure on governments has forced swifter action, and communities have proven that they’re willing to make major changes both to help themselves but also for a greater good. Maybe, thinks Atkin, the “we’re all in it together” attitude could help to progress the climate cause too.That’s not to say that ing head first into the corona–climate crossover has necessarily made her more confident about the future. When the newsletter started there was momentum behind a Green New Deal, a host of candidates with different climate policies fighting it out in the democratic primary, and climate change forums being broadcast on network TV.“Focus has ways been climate change’s number one problem,” says Atkin. “Journalists aren’t willing to cover it properly, people don’t want to to talk about, politicians with vested interests can’t be bothered.” It’s a crisis in prioritisation, and the coronavirus has certainly sapped momentum from the movement.The relative speed at which states have moved on the coronavirus compared to inaction on the long-running climate catastrophe front has also confirmed one of Atkin’s greatest fears: that we live in societies so focused on the short-term that we wait to see the worst happening with our own eyes before we act on it. She isn’t optimistic about that changing any time soon, so that’s where Heated fits into her thinking.”I see my responsibility as documenting the short-term effects of climate change more aggressively so people understand, just like coronavirus, climate change is killing people right now,” she says. Some, Atkin says, might think this make her an activist. “But I think it simply makes me someone who cares about human life, which is a basic tenet of journalism.” Far from being irresponsible to talk about the climate during the coronavirus crisis, as Atkin puts it: it’s irresponsible not to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5243a7948b9d7007cfa43b4cf651fd4895534ed7/0_0_3943_2366/master/3943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26f4beed5129d07dd9ca9d14946cda44","title":"do you know your rihanna gowns and lady gaga outfit changes find out with our met gala quiz","story":"The gala, due to take place this week, has been postponed because of coronavirus.

To younger audiences, the joke no longer makes any sense. In Airplane!’s day, sword-and-sandals movies had become an outdated, unwittingly homoerotic joke. But then came Gladiator, and the joke was on us. Released 20 years ago this month, Ridley Scott’s Roman epic gave the old cliches a new lease of life. It was all here: Colosseum action! Rippling man-flesh! Tigers! But Gladiator had its cheesecake and ate it. It served up crowd-pleasing spectacle and airline-ad visuals but also solemn, Oscar-worthy drama (and, in retrospect, a fair degree of camp).Gladiator was one of the first movies to make use of CGI technology to recreate actual history, rather than aliens and monsters. Its ancient Rome, packed with virtual crowds, looks like a video game at times, but back in 2000 it was groundbreaking. Others took note. Within a few years we had a mini sword-and-sandals revival: Troy, Alexander, King Arthur. By Zack Snyder’s overblown 300, the genre had devolved back into parody, but it has never really gone away: Joaquin Phoenix’s incestuous despot in Gladiator has a very Game of Thrones vibe to him, for example. Ridley Scott tried to repeat the original formula himself, first with the post-911 Crusades drama Kingdom of Heaven, which only proved that Orlando Bloom was no Russell Crowe, then with 2010’s Robin Hood, which proved that Russell Crowe wasn’t exactly his former self, either.Gladiator was the pinnacle of Crowe’s career (he won the best actor Oscar) but also the beginning of his transition from commanding Hollywood lead to grumpy, difficult a. The way Crowe tells it, he “rescued” Gladiator, giving it his all on-screen and whipping the awful script into shape off it. You get the impression Crowe has thought of himself as the boss ever since, hence the stories of bad behaviour, the irritable press interviews, the abortive second career as a rock star. He has mellowed somewhat recently, using his menace to good effect in True History of the Kelly Gang, and as Roger Ailes in The Loudest Voice, but the steady ascent of Joaquin Phoenix’s career is a study in contrasts – and, perhaps, ego management. Phoenix tends to disappear into his characters Crowe’s real-life persona often overshadows his.Now Gladiator is ancient history itself but, in some ways, its story is more relevant now than it was then: an undeserving despot who hijacks a mighty empire and betrays its principles, who sidelines the wise politicians and distracts the citizens from his corruption with violent, populist spectacle. “Fear and wonder, a powerful combination,” as Derek Jacobi’s sidelined senator puts it. Gladiator both served it up and warned us against it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74ca13d0238e1ffbc2256c899c6f310e2de1b735/0_62_4838_2902/master/4838.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66ba317eb85b4d46ccf9c8cfaa7a0d24","title":"joanna lumley celebrity gogglebox absolutely fabulous lockdown tv","story":"The Absolutely Fabulous star shares her lockdown viewing habits – and explains why she’d never do StrictlyI’m here with my husband.

See how it transforms a simple spring soupWith its flared top, funnelled length, high heel and spur, Italy is unmistakably a thigh-high boot. It becomes a knee-high boot if you cut it in half, following a line from Rome on the Tyrrhenian coast, to Porto d’Ascoli on the Adriatic one, which is pretty much what the Via Salaria does, give or take the odd curve.The original imprint of the road predates the foundation of Rome, and was the work of an ancient population of settlers and warriors called Sabini. These early routes were created gradually, bit by bit, to move supplies between settlements – the most important of which was sal, salt, produced in salt pans on both coasts from both oceans. Under the Romans, these became the first consular routes and were named – purposefully – Via Salaria. Those marching along the Salt Road were often paid with the valuable substance they transported, which is where the Latin salarium – salary – comes from. Also, the idea of salt as worth and wisdom. Things done cum grano salis, with a grain of salt, are done discerningly, as opposed to foolishly because you have no salt in your head, or in your soup.These last few, persistently rainy days of quarantine, I’ve made even more soup than usual, and also re-read much of Samin Nosrat’s book, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. Where would we be without salt? Adrift in a sea of blandness, is her answer, before she hopes: “If one lesson from this book stays with you, let it be this: salt has a greater impact on flavour than any other ingredient. Learn to use it well and your food will taste good.” I can’t help but think that Samin’s attitude to salt is a bit like that of the Sabini, knowing it is at the heart of everything and adding it in the same way they built their salt road – gradually, bit by bit. She recommends getting to know your salt, then adding it at all stages of cooking, because it is what coaxes out flavour.I use two sorts of salt, both from Sicily: sale fino – fine sea salt for seasoning – and sale grosso, tiny, hard-pebble-like sea salt for salting water, which I keep in jars near the cooker. The spoon in the sale grosso pot holds about 10g of it, which is what I add to every litre of water for boiling pasta and vegetables. For fine salt, I use my fingers: a thumb with one finger is 1g, with two fingers is 2g, with three fingers is 6g, and with four it’s 10g – obviously this is all personal and as vague as a home serving of gin. Most of the time I am adding 2g at time and tasting constantly, especially when I am making improvisational soups such as this week’s recipe.Samin mentions how the chef Judy Rodgers often told her chefs a dish needed seven grains of salt. I read lots of food writing and few things stick, but Judy’s seven grains and Samin’s salting – doing so every step of the way, like the Sabini – have adhered like sticky seeds to a woolly jumper reminders of the need to taste and adjust salt discerningly.It is hard to judge for salt when food is scalding hot sitting alters flavour, so leave it to sit before tasting and adjusting salt and pepper – if indeed it needs it.6 tbsp olive oil1 onion, diced1 celery stick, dicedA sprig of rosemarySalt1 medium potato, diced400g courgettes1.5 litres water2 tins cannellini beans2 thick slices stale breadDried oreganoOlive oil, for fryingPut the olive oil, onion, celery, rosemary and a pinch of salt in a large, heavy-based pan and set over a medium flame. Cook, stirring until the onion is starting to soften and turn translucent. Add the potato and another small pinch of salt, stir, then add the water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.Meanwhile trim the courgettes, cut into four lengthways and then into quarter moons about 3mm thick. Drain and rinse the beans, then taste them to see how salty they are.Once the soup has been simmering for 10 minutes, add the courgettes and the beans, and continue simmering for another 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. Check salt and pepper, and set aside for at least an hour.When you are ready to eat, reheat the soup. Cut the bread into 2cm squares. In a separate pan, warm a little olive oil, add the bread, sprinkle with salt and dried oregano, and fry until golden.

Every year we wonder whether we are going to make it through the next season and what the funding is going to be like. It’s just been quite uncertain.”For the uninitiated, in 2016 Hashtag United was converted from a ramshackle seven-a-side team to a team that would compete on YouTube for all to see. The founder Spencer Owen would arrange for the matches, played against staff teams of professional clubs and Sunday league and non-league teams, to be filmed and uploaded to the website. Win a certain number of games and there would be promotion in a fictional league. Now, they have almost half a million subscribers on YouTube and Instagram, close to 200,000 followers on Twitter as well as a men’s team playing more formally in the tier-nine Essex Senior League.The news of their takeover of AFC Basildon, the team Hashtag United Women FC, was met with an outpouring of support on social media. The former England internationals Karen Carney and Sue Smith, Manchester United’s Siobhan Chamberlain, Chelsea’s captain César Azpilicueta and Roma were just a few to express their delight for AFC Basildon, who are in the Women’s National League South East Division 1, the fourth tier of women’s football, and play on Canvey Island.When Hashtag United decided to tackle the men’s pyramid, they were comfortable starting at the bottom. Stepping into the women’s game is a very different landscape though. “Women’s football and men’s football are in very different places, and this team was in a very different situation,” says Owen. “When I met the guys it was made quite clear to me that without the support of someone like us the club was probably going to fold. The level they’re at, the great players they have got and the work they’ve done, it just seemed mad.”Why the decision to step into women’s football at all? “I watched the last few Women’s World Cups,” says Owen. “I’m always up for watching any kind of football and I’ve never thought of it in an insular way.” What surprised him was the response to the Lionesses more widely. “Maybe it was partly that it was a nice footballing time for the nation in general, the men had done well the year before them so there was a lot of hope that is usually not necessarily there.“And people are maybe just a little bit less ignorant about the fact that football isn’t just a load of men running around, it’s about the game and the game can be played in many different ways and by many different people.”He tweeted out a call for teams nearby the Essex based Hashtag to get in touch. “I knew that the dream scenario for us would be, rather than just sponsoring and giving a club some money, bringing something within our club that we could really offer long-term support to and hopefully allow people to profit from the profile and the fan base we have,” he says.AFC Basildon “stood out” as they are the highest ranked women’s team in Essex and are in the – now suspended – County Cup final. “You think on the surface, they are going to be the one that’s most protected, the most set up, the least in need of help but that wasn’t the case,” Owen says. “There were four guys running a club that was massively overperforming, and they had done a fantastic job.The aim is to offer stability, exposure and “give our audience different kinds of football heroes”. In AFC Basildon they’ve got plenty. Bailess is one of three players working in the NHS. She is a respiratory physiotherapist working in intensive care. “Everything is very different at the moment and we’re all having to be flexible and adapt to new roles and be pushed out of our comfort zone,” she says.“It’s really nice to have something to look forward to for when this is all over, especially when you can’t come home from work and have your release: going and playing football and seeing your mates.”Owen adds: “We’re playing a level where both our men’s and women’s players have still got normal jobs, they’re not professional athletes, they’re real people with real jobs. Three of the women’s team work in healthcare so are super, super critical right now and probably unbelievably snowed under and stressed.“When we announce new things we’re doing, it can have a genuine impact on people’s lives, it’s really been a cause of positivity. These guys that play in this team, they make it, it’s their passion, it’s called semi-professional football for a reason. They have to treat it like a job even though you don’t get the money to allow you to do it instead of a job.

Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short?

Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear).

On ourselves, our relationships and what’s important to us. For some of us, that means reaching out to old friends, or healing old wounds with people we once thought we’d never speak to again. And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences – from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven’t spoken to in years …Emma*: ‘Coronavirus gave me a reason to reach out to my brother’“I’d always had a good relationship with my brother, but it came crashing down last Christmas when my family discovered he’d been keeping his gambling addiction from us. He’d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress – I just couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he’d been helping her with food deliveries while she’s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we’ve been coping – a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I’ve never visited. I’d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.“I also realised that life is too short – if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I’m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.”Michael: ‘Lockdown made me realise what’s important’“My ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We’d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what’s important.“I reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time – I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it’s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I’ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we’ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don’t know if we’d have ever reached this point.”Jo: ‘I’m connecting with family members I haven’t spoken to in years’“We have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as inidual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn’t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages – pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.“My mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who’s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who’ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch. It’s really lovely to feel connected to everyone, particularly as the two people that held us all together are no longer here.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedFamily has rarely felt more precious, nor has staying in touch with each other and the world.

They married months later and now live in Hollywood, FloridaCarol Natelson and Ray Bertoia had been travelling the world for years working in casinos when they met on a cruise ship in 1995. “I was working on another ship and was moved to her ship by pure chance,” he says. “As I was boarding, I spotted her outside a cabin reading a magazine. I just knew straight away that she was the one for me.”Carol, who is American, had sworn off dating, but, despite her reservations, romance blossomed quickly. “I thought he was cute and then we ended up spending lots of time together,” she says. They shared their first kiss on the island of Mayreau in the Grenadines. “We pretty much became a couple within two weeks of meeting. We had so much fun it was like being on a holiday.”They spent three months together onboard the ship, before Carol’s contract finished. “I still had six months left, but there was no way I was staying on the ship without her,” says Ray, who is originally from Scotland.Although he had been planning a career working in the cruise casino industry, Ray didn’t hesitate to leave for Carol. They disembarked in Los Angeles, before heading to Palm Springs, where she found work in a local casino. It was hard work and long hours, but they loved the lifestyle. “We were in the pool one day when I asked her to marry me,” says Ray. “We went to Las Vegas in June to get hitched. Our witnesses included Carol’s sister and a few people we’d met on the ship.” The marriage meant Ray could start working at the same casino in Palm Springs. “Our wedding happened so fast that I don’t think anyone thought we’d last,” laughs Carol. “But here we are, 25 years later.”The couple built a home for themselves in Palm Springs. They kept up their passion for travel with regular trips to Europe. “Ray learnt to sail, too,” says Carol. “One of the things that I love most about him is that he is always up for anything and he likes to do different things.”She also loves his honesty and caring nature: “He doesn’t just care about me, he cares about everyone.” Ray says they have always been on the same wavelength. “I just liked her from the first moment. She loves an adventure and she’s a fantastic cook. I think when you know, you just know.”In 2009, Ray became seriously ill due to complications from erticulitis, a digestive condition, and ended up on life support in a coma. His mother died while he was in hospital and it took him a long time to recover. For the next three months, Carol nursed him back to health. “Without her, I don’t know what I would have done,” he says.The couple had always dreamed of moving to the beach. In 2017, they took the plunge and bought a new home in Hollywood, Florida. “We have lots of family here. We can look out of the window and see the cruise ships,” says Carol. Ray found a job at the Hard Rock guitar casino when they moved.He is currently out of work due to the pandemic, but says they are “very lucky”. “We were meant to be going on a cruise to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary this year,” says Carol. “But we’ll just have to wait a bit longer.”Although Ray was 39 and Carol was 42 when they married, it was the first wedding for both of them. “Before Ray, I was always choosing the wrong guy,” says Carol. “It’s been so great to be with someone who I can always count on to be there for me.”Want to share your story?

Today brings eerie 80s synths, one of pop’s greatest come-ons and a shimmering enduring love. Check back weekdays for more picksby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas,  Alexis Petridis and  Laura SnapesAs the coronavirus lockdown continues, the ’s music desk thought you might be in need of a distraction – something to send you down memory lane, or to ert the annoyance at your housemates or children on to us. We present to you a ranking of the 100 greatest UK No 1 singles since the charts began in 1952.We’ll be counting this down over six weeks – for the first two weeks, we’ll spend Monday to Thursday counting down 10 at a time. That takes us up to the Top 20, and from Monday to Friday for four weeks we’ll have standalone celebrations of each remaining song by our team of critics.This list, and the songs’ order, was compiled via a politely raging video call between me, chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis and deputy music editor Laura Snapes. The ranking isn’t based on sales or longevity, it’s the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once.As such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section. We’d love to hear what you think of our choices – whether in agreement or outrage – and hear your fond or not-so-fond memories of these singles. After we’ve reached No 1, we’ll ask what you think we unforgivably missed out from the overall list, and then publish highlights from your selections. Also, note that dates listed are the dates the songs reached No 1.You could spend years arguing about what constitutes the first rock’n’roll record. Rock Around the Clock patently isn’t it, but it was, incontrovertibly, the record that brought rock’n’roll to mainstream attention in the UK: two minutes of music that sounded infinitely more feral than its avuncular artist looked and that changed pop music for ever. APBy disavowing the hollow opulence and bloated scale of pop’s reigning class, Lorde accidentally ushered in a brand new one: there would be no Billie Eilish if not for her conspiratorial incantations. While she weathered accusations of appropriation for disavowing hip-hop cliches in her obviously rap-influenced delivery, she ultimately echoed the genre’s own move towards unvarnished portrayals of teenage disaffection instigated by a parallel wave of SoundCloud upstarts. As much a generational bellwether as a pop classic. LSRecorded in a Coventry front room, Mouldy Old Dough sounds like pop music made by people who have never actually heard pop music, but have had it described to them by someone who didn’t really know what they were talking about: pub piano, growled vocals, a beat that recalls a drunk doggedly staggering home. The weirdness of 70s Britain in musical form. APIf you wanted evidence of how far out, how unbound by the usual rules reggae was, you could find it at the top of the charts in early 1971: a piano line taken – sampled if you like – from Ramsey Lewis a vocalist who largely grunted and bellowed incomprehensibly in the style of a Jamaican deejay: “I am the magnificent W-O-O-O!” It still sounds fantastic. APThe pinnacle of Roy Orbison’s career as rock’s great tragedian: three astonishing, inconsolable minutes during which stars cry, rainbows weep, golden days are sorrowfully recalled and drums beat a leaden funeral march, before it all reaches a terrible climax, Orbison desperately repeating the title as if misery is a kind of catharsis. APIt won’t be too much of a spoiler to reveal that this is the only No 1 single in this list that concerns how the brutally uncaring nature of new technology can paradoxically deepen nostalgia while rendering the past irrelevant. Trevor Horn and co turned this material into postmodern gold, building jingles, prog, orchestral pop and more into a screwball fantasy. That cold steady kick drum, meanwhile, is like techno kicking the door down to take over pop culture. BBTAfter a fitfully successful start, this was the song to turn the Kosovan-British pop singer into a global star. You can almost feel her clamp a hand on your shoulder as she adopts a stern, schoolmarmish tone to dispense those rules for breakup survival: don’t answer your ex’s calls, let them pop round or even be their friend. She’s not telling us or her mates, though, but rather herself, making for a powerful pop psychodrama. BBTBehind the simple, perky rock’n’roll facade – “the ultimate fairground anthem”, as writer Bob Stanley put it – there’s something disturbing about Del Shannon’s biggest hit: an eeriness about the rumble of the opening guitar chords and the echoing keyboard solo, a sense the vocal is slightly too impassioned and pained. The result is as compelling a single as 1961 produced. APHad These Boots Are Made for Walkin’ been sung by a man, as its author, Lee Hazlewood, had intended, it would just have been nasty. Sung with insouciant cool by the recently orced Nancy Sinatra, however, it became something else entirely: camp but tough, funny but fierce, completely irresistible. APSaturday Night just pipped Gina G’s Ooh Aah … Just a Little Bit to our 90s Eurobanger slot. First off, it’s an actual Eurobanger (not an Aussie impersonator), and like the Village People’s YMCA, it has a dance routine invented by fans that came to define the song. It’s got an immediately iconic tag (“dee dee da da da!”), plus it was the victor in one of pop’s funniest plagiarism cases: I want some of whatever the person who thinks this sounds like Lindisfarne’s Fog on the Tyne was having. LSThere will be howls of protestation at Bieber being on this list, a man routinely cited as everything that is facile about pop and celebrity. Well, he’s had his moments, but this is one of his equally frequent triumphs. Taking the Insta-filtered aesthetic of the then-popular tropical house sound and marrying it to a melody that flits like a bird of paradise always coming back to its perch, it has the melancholically fleeting beauty of a package holiday sunset. BBTProducer Richard X gets a lot of credit for the shuddering magnitude of invention behind the Sugababes’ debut UK No 1 – the first legit single of the 2000s bootleg wave, bringing together Adina Howard and Tubeway Army – but not all of it. The newly minted trio of Mutya, Keisha and Heidi pull off a more convincing “I’m grown now” transition than any of their American pop peers, thanks to the terrifying nonchalance innate to British teenage girls. It’s got a classic belting “may-ee!” (that’s “me” in millennial pop terms) and without it, you wouldn’t have Sound of the Underground – or, even, possibly, whisper it, Toxic. LSLike the Old Testament God, Craig chills on a Sunday, but unlike the Old Testament God, he spends Monday and Tuesday engineering sex and spends the rest of the days until the sabbath having it. We looked upon his creation and saw that it was good: his vocals, drilled in the dexterity of the garage rave, twine around delicate acoustic guitar lines like two lovers in Eden. BBTEvery part of Adamski’s production is perfectly designed: the sad chords, the funkily interrupted alien transmission of the synths, the prodding bassline with its edges almost imperceptibly corroded by acid. Most beautiful of all is Seal: half activist, half oracle. BBTThe product of producer Joe Meek’s twin obsessions – space travel and the recording studio as an instrument in itself – Telstar is otherworldly and breathlessly exciting, piling on layer after layer of sounds so dense with effects it is impossible to work out what instrument is making them. It’s like nothing else, before or since. APThis will get you thinking, “I miss the old Kanye” – the rapper’s touristic whirl through Ribena, wags and the epithet “rubbish” is full of wit with just a touch of his incoming megalomania. Estelle is even better, perfectly capturing the mood of uncertain excitement at a potential American lover: “Like the way he speaking, his confidence is peaking  Don’t like his baggy jeans but I might like what’s underneath them.” The bump of will.i.am’s cosmic funk production launches it into the transatlantic skies. BBTDecades of ubiquity have dulled the impact of I Will Survive, but the song only became ubiquitous in the first place because it connected with so many people so directly. The strings soar, the lyrics project defiance in the face of a controlling ex-partner, who’s tried chancing his arm again: “I’m not that chained up little person still in love with you.” API Will Survive recast in hi-tech 90s dance-pop, complete with that notorious Auto-Tune wiggle to Cher’s voice. The effect is actually used sparingly, and the song’s wild success – 11m copies sold worldwide – is not down to anything gimmicky. Rather, it’s all very old-fashioned stuff that ensures Believe will be hollered in cheese nights for evermore: a powerhouse melody Cher uses to dispense a kind of den-mother wisdom. BBT“But I don’t look back,” Robyn insists over and over on her only UK chart-topper, though the racing arpeggiated synths, never resolving to the home key, tell a different story: one of someone doomed to the purgatory of heartbreak, or worse, revelling in it (a Greek chorus of strings charged with Kate Bush’s DNA outlines the tragedy). “And – it – hurts – with – ev – er – y – heart – beat,” Robyn pants, and you feel it, each syllable landing like a tombstone. LSFor someone who admits how hopeless he was at romance, Elton John couldn’t half-sell a love song. Are You Ready for Love? runs the gamut of emotions as he tries to win someone over: he’s casually cool about devotion yet awed by it grandiose in his overtures, then almost manically overcome by fear that this person might not, in fact, be ready for love. The Thom Bell-assisted Philly soul production festoons John with strings, hand percussion, wah-wah guitar, key changes – in a sense perfectly echoing the maximalist, hasty approach to seduction that John has said he practised at the peak of his career. It’s extraordinary that it took 24 years and a football advert to make it a hit. LSThis wasn’t the stuff of high-speed swerving grime bars. Instead, Dave and Fredo use steady, perfectly calibrated flows to set themselves apart from the London MCs one generation above them, set to minimalist trap. The effect is of being told something extra clearly, as if you haven’t understood: a brilliantly withering technique. Rap’s status as a core part of British pop culture was consolidated. BBTThe pop charts were particularly dominated by sweeping, sentimental ballads until the mid-1960s, and there are PhDs to be written on the effect on pop music of a sexually repressed culture of manners. Anyway, many such ballads are suffocatingly schmaltzy, but this one is sublime. It was written by Trent with Tony Hatch, a somewhat forgotten genius of this period who shared Burt Bacharach’s knack for orchestral drama. The pair had an affair, with Hatch leaving his wife and marrying Trent – this collaboration is full of that impetuous, untameable ardour. BBTIt’s unclear whether Thunderclap Newman thought they were making a kind of eulogy for 60s counterculture, but that’s how Something in the Air turned out. Its music is ineffably melancholy, its insistence that “the revolution’s here”, a year after the hippy dream had curdled, sounds desperate and hopeless. Intentional or not, it’s really moving. APPerhaps it takes not having lived through the 80s heyday of new age, then its subsequent ubiquity and mockery to appreciate Orinoco Flow as the compositional marvel it is. Yes, the lyrics are incredibly silly – but the layered pizzicato shimmer transforms Enya’s dippy travelogue into a true pop mirage, stoking its allure as her siren song constantly slips further out of reach. LSThe lyrics are essentially a QVC infomercial for the eroto-psychedelic effects of ecstasy – “Lotions of love flow through your hands  See visions, colours every day” – and the music is shamelessly designed to intensify drug experiences. The junglist breakbeats keep the energy high, while the big piano chords and yearning vocals are like a head massage from some bloke you just met but nevertheless now feel a deeper kinship with than your immediate family. BBTChannelling Bach and the Beats, the trippy imagery of this 10m seller made it a fave of those turning on and tuning in during the Summer of Love. But the Hammond organ creates a valedictory mood as the drug epiphanies betray their lies – “Although my eyes were open  They might have just as well’ve been closed” – and the entitlement and rapacity of the now widely hated Worst Generation becomes clear: “I was feeling kinda seasick  But the crowd called out for more.” A funeral hymn, then, but no less beautiful for it. BBTYou can imagine an older relative calling this “a proper song” – unfussy and instantly classic, where the quality of Eg White’s composition gives it automatic promotion to a different league. Young negotiates the middle eight’s key changes with the same sad certainty he negotiates his emotions, choosing self-preservation over a second chance at love. BBTThe softest of soft rock, If You Leave Me Now doesn’t seem to play so much as glide along, wrapped in a blanket of French horns and strings, the drummer tapping so gently it sounds as if he’s trying not to wake someone up. It’s impossibly lush and beautifully written, but its sadness is pervasive and affecting. APThe heaviest, sweariest No 1 in UK history – with one of the best riffs, too – only reached No 25 when it was first released in 1992, but reached the top in 2009 after a grassroots campaign from people angry at a run of X Factor contestants dominating the Christmas No 1 race. Its “Fuck you, I won’t do what you tell me” climax, aimed at authority figures from the police to parents for years, was gleefully beamed at Simon Cowell in a great moment for British democracy. BBTAlmost 25 years down the line, Wannabe sounds so rinky-dink and innocent (save the “zig-a-zig-ah”, which continues up a lineage of sexy pop nonsense started by Little Richard’s “a-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom!” almost four decades prior) that it’s almost inconceivable it was considered such a threat at the time. But it was: in two minutes, 53 seconds, these five women undid tween pop’s raison d’etre – seducing girls into a life of domesticity via parades of harmless male crushes – and rewrote it in their own chaotic, girls-first spirit. LSDance music No 1s almost always bang, but this one pumps: a deep-house anthem of huge subtlety and power. The way the rhythm-guitar line insinuates itself, only to be subsumed by those cut-up strings, mirrors Cassandra’s audible bafflement at being taken over by a love she doesn’t understand. The confusing rush of ecstasy, in every sense, has never been so beautifully evoked. BBTDance-pop in the 90s often traded in profound melancholy – Haddaway’s What Is Love and Corona’s Rhythm of the Night being other classic examples – and Rhythm Is a Dancer is one of the saddest of all. With its gospel vocals and cathedral-ready chords, it makes raving feel like a serious spiritual quest rather than something to do on a Friday. BBTPop holds few greater pleasures than seeing a pop song about the power of pop songs take on that kind of lure itself. In Come on Eileen, Kevin Rowland reflects on the sad songs beloved by a downtrodden generation and promises his crush they’ll hum a different tune. Come on Eileen became that song: a romp through wistfulness, bonhomie and knees-up antics that distils the riotous emotional arc of a night in an Irish pub into three-and-a-half perfect minutes. LSMatching disco a Loleatta Holloway for lung power is near impossible but M People’s Heather Small – working incognito after Italian producers Black Box were refused a Holloway sample – blows the house down, and her “let me tell you, what you do to me” is so sexily intense. This is a Terminator of a song, unstoppably delivering a payload of pure euphoria as Chicago house is spliced with Italo disco to create perfect pop. BBTIt’s testament to time’s steady erosion that a song about an obsessive fan who murdered his pregnant girlfriend and killed himself because his favourite rapper didn’t notice him has become a casual byword for effusive devotion. Coming full circle, Stan is worthy of it. It’s the peak of Eminem’s storytelling skill and – in spite of the clear misanthropy of the titular fan – profoundly empathetic, as Eminem tempers Stan’s violence by understanding the desperation fuels it. LSA depressing economy of sex and power, observed with simmering beta-male jealousy, is sketched in just 12 lines over a melody that has the perfect symmetry of a model’s face. Computer Love, the exquisite other half of this double A-side, is another portrait of loneliness but couldn’t be more different: it is tender and naively yearning. BBTToo often discarded as a novelty hit, 99 Red Balloons is the best pop song about cold war anxiety in a field full of try-hard duds, and a chart-topping coronation for the tough, peppy new wave sound being pioneered by the Go-Go’s, the Bangles and the Waitresses. (The original German version is still the best, however.) LSA fabulously bitchy kiss-off to the three members of Cockney Rebel who left the band after their 1974 album The Psychomodo, the genius of Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) is to couch its screw-you message in the sunniest, most charming, irresistibly hook-laden music imaginable. APJailhouse Rock was intended as a joke by writers Leiber and Stoller, complete with a nudging reference to gay sex. Elvis, however, ignored the comic undercurrent, and sang it with such blazing intensity that the performance almost collapses at 1:14. If you want a No 1 that captures his early, feral power, this is it. APMost mid-00s indie nostalgia is tinged with shame: the polka dots, bad fringes and herky-jerky dancing have not dated well. But Arctic Monkeys’ debut single proper is something to look back on with pride – not because, as the NME of the era would have it, it represented any kind of jingoistic “victory” for indie over pop, but because its rattling potency and Alex Turner’s lyrics distil the pleasures of that era worth remembering: “Just bangin’ tunes and DJ sets and  Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness.” LSAfter all that Ariana Grande had been through – the Manchester Arena bombing, the death of a beloved ex, a broken engagement – she could have released 10 minutes of primal screaming and still left critics saying: yeah, fair enough. Instead, she changed the game: after the more stateswomanly Sweetener album released earlier that year, surprise return Thank U, Next accelerated pop’s processing speed (particularly liberating female pop stars in the process) and quashed the idea that empowerment is contingent on taking someone else down. Its nimbleness is the sound of Grande’s freedom. LS“Breaking up is so very hard to do” – this Burt Bacharach-penned ballad opens with a wry bit of understatement from Scott Walker, and he deals with things very magnanimously from here on out: a stiff upper lip in song. The way the choir, timpani, strings, horns, guitars and more all stay meringue-fluffy in the arrangement is Bacharach just showing off, really. BBTOriginally written for Britney Spears, although it’s inconceivable to imagine her doing it. Umbrella needs swagger and Rihanna had it in spades, turning a stunted beat and a lyric that’s pretty dorky on paper into one of pop’s great come-ons. It’s a skill that earned Rihanna a deserved place in the pantheon of pop icons. LSEric Stewart wrote I’m Not in Love after his wife, Gloria, complained that he didn’t say “I love you” often enough – not out of petulance, but to express his depth of feeling for her beyond the cliche. After a labour-intensive recording process featuring endless harmonising and dozens of feet of tape loops, 10cc came away with this work of stubborn beauty: a sublime, shimmering evocation of the ineffable bond between two lovers. It endures in every sense: Stewart and Gloria have been married for more than 50 years. LSA posthumous chart-topper after her death in a plane crash when she was 22, More Than a Woman is one of the trio of masterpiece singles she made with Timbaland, along with We Need a Resolution and Try Again. Into the producer’s serpentine frameworks stepped a woman whose calm, exacting poise let you come to her rather than she to you. It never gets less wrenching to think what else she might have done. BBTAh, the song of the summer. Its lustre has been dulled by it being played by every wedding band in the western hemisphere (and by Limmy’s eternally funny tweet), but Get Lucky still shines underneath it all. Take it off the alcopop-splashed CDJs and back into headphones and you can newly appreciate its mastery, with the liveness of Nile Rodgers’ guitar and Pharrell’s conversational charm. BBTOn one hand, All the Things She Said is the ne plus ultra of queerbaiting: two straight Russian teenagers cajoled into lesbian cosplay by some dodgy-sounding svengalis. But as ersatz as their ardour was, the duo’s debut UK single was charged with a perfect evocation of the frantic emotional tumult that rages in every closeted, yearning teenager’s head. An industrial cri de cœur with a brilliantly desperate synth climax, it was the greatest Trevor Horn banger since his mid-80s sweet spot. LSThe boy band – well, Gary Barlow – had already shown they could do serious and affecting balladry with A Million Love Songs, and then they perfectly honed that skill for this classic breakup song. There’s real poetry in the verses, which gives way to the devastating plainness of the chorus, like 100 red roses left at a doorstep. Barlow goes for total abasement, though – “Whenever I’m wrong  Just tell me the song and I’ll sing it” – so you don’t really fancy his chances. BBTYou might think using crisp drum machines and eerie synths to cover a northern soul anthem would make it more brittle, but Soft Cell’s version of Gloria Jones’s 1964 song actually has more swing and sensuality. There’s something portentous about those insistent, fateful synth stabs, and Marc Almond adds to the sense of doom with his innate flair for drama. BBTTo watch Top of the Pops as 1987 gives way to 1988 is to watch the freaks taking over the asylum: after MARRS and Bomb the Bass’s earlier acid house hits, S-Express’s sample-heavy track affirmed the sound’s chart coronation, making the Stock Aitken Waterman stable look even more square, and stuck one in the eye of London’s throttlingly cool club scene with its euphoric, queer collage.

Later on I wondered who played the drums: oh, it’s this guy Tony Allen. He became my superstar.It was the sound of Nigeria in a rhythm. It’s that undeniable groove that makes you want to dance, and that’s what I think and feel when I’m around Nigerians. It’s an energy, it’s a force it’s not aggressive but it’s not tame. When a Nigerian’s in the room, you know a Nigerian’s in the room, and that’s how I feel about Tony’s playing: once he lays that beat on a Fela track it’s here to stay for the next half an hour.Tony said he’d heard good things about me, and asked when was I gonna come and see him. I said: “Any time!” Like an ignorant Londoner I just assumed he lived in London, only to find out he lives in Paris. One of my friends told me you can get the Megabus there – say no more. I got it at 11pm, arriving in Paris at 6am. I would walk around Paris aimlessly for hours, and then I’d have a drum lesson with him in the afternoon. But it was more than a lesson: we would sit down, hang out, eat. He was fun, he had a youthful buzz about him. He was grateful for life. It was like hanging out with an old uncle. He was awfully grumpy in the mornings, but by the evening he was great.He laughed when I was playing and said: “Why is everything so aggressive?” I was like: “What do you mean? It’s the drums, man, that’s what they’re for!” So for the first few lessons we worked on playing Fela Kuti beats really quietly together, really trying to get inside all the things about music that make a drum beat powerful, apart from sheer force.Another thing I got from him is how many ways there are to make people dance. Are you going to lay the most simple beat to keep a platform for everyone else, or something more complicated? I got all that from him. Whether I’m playing with Jorja Smith or Ezra Collective, you’ll always hear something I can directly point towards and say: I learned that from Tony Allen. He’s the biggest musical influence on my playing, without a doubt.Questlove, Chris Dave, Moses Boyd – these are all people I know are directly influenced by Tony too, but none of us can make a beat sit down and groove like he did. It’s so weird, because it’s not even that hard. You’ll look at the notes, what he’s doing, and you’re like: right, I can play everything in the right place. But when he does it, it just sounds better. Like when a really great narrator reads a sentence, it just has an authority to it that you couldn’t give, even if you can read the same sentence. He had a special gift.I’ve known Tony since the late 80s. I had never met someone so positive, it was crazy. With Tony, it’s always about what can make the music beautiful, what can bring music to people’s hearts, what can make them dance. He never bitched about anything, never blamed anyone for anything.He stayed as long as he could with the oppression in Nigeria with Fela. For his own sake, he had to leave to have a career. But was really grateful of the experience of being at the forefront, at the roots of Afrobeat. With Fela’s band, the horns, the singing, everybody can go wherever they want, because they know when they come back, they know there’s something holding them: Tony. He completely changed the way of playing drums: instead of hitting them hard, he put the percussionist’s role into the drums. The cowbell is always the driver of Afrobeat, and that’s why he plays so laid back. I’m looking at him, like: “You don’t even sweat. I’m singing and sweating – come on Tony, man, don’t rub it in, sweat a little bit!” But he said: “No, I never sweat.”In a music business that is really dominated by men, it’s very hard to find a real gentleman. Manu Dibango is one, Tony Allen is one, and Hugh Masekela. The woman and person that I am, they respect it, before even respecting the artist that I am, and that is something that I derive my strength from. It’s very hard when you’re a woman in this business, and on top of that you’re an African woman, you’re black? God help you. And so to have such strong men who look at you and say: “What are you afraid of? Go for it, we’ll be here”? I’m flying high.Tony didn’t speak much. He listened, and he had that smile: I’m sitting at my drums, and I’m in heaven. He would then look at me, and say: “Are you ready?” And he hit and I followed. You look at his hands, and his whole body – he’s like a painter, a storyteller, he’s just building everything around him. And you think, OK, this house is sturdy, I’m going to sit in it and do whatever I have to do.When I was doing the album Eve, I went back to Benin and cut some tracks with drummers there, and as soon as you say Tony Allen, they go: “Oh my God, it’s because of him that I’m doing drums.” In the new generation of Afrobeats that’s coming from Africa, Tony is at the centre of it – he allows the youth today to cut and paste, do whatever they want to do with that rhythm. Afrobeats is also proof of the back and forth of music that left Africa to go to Europe and come back. It’s a constant exchange, it’s non-stop – trying to stop it is like trying to fight immigration, it’s impossible. And Tony is at the epicentre of it. He’s the foundation of the house.Aged 25, I was playing a role in a movie by Quentin Dupieux, aka Mr Oizo. At night, the sound engineer would play a lot of Fela Kuti: super involving, a real discovery for me, and I was totally fascinated by the drums. Six months later, I was in Paris talking with friends and I said: “Oh la la, my favourite drummer is the drummer of Fela.” Someone said: “You know his name is Tony Allen? And he lives in Paris, in a very strange place – La Défense.” Tony Allen is living in the business centre of Paris?! OK – I will call him for my new song.This was La Ritournelle, a very important song for me. I already had the chords, the melody, and I was looking for a drummer. Tony asked for the music before he came in the studio, so he listened a lot to the piano. He was working a lot, but not playing – he was thinking about the music. Tony was a very intellectual guy. And at one point, boom, he’s ready. I need maybe 15 or 20 takes to be happy, but Tony was a one-take guy. Maybe two, to be nice.I kept the entire take, I didn’t do an edit of it. You can put the instruments in the computer and edit everything, but with Tony it was impossible to do that – the drums are too complicated. It’s like a big river. It’s a very human style of drumming, a lot of feelings, with a real story inside, and so if you edit it, you destroy the story.Before Tony, La Ritournelle was good, I liked the chords. But when Tony played, it was really magic. He chose to start the ride cymbal when the singing starts – you have maybe six minutes with the hi-hat, and when I sing, he moves to the ride. It gave a magical touch to the song, it was a brilliant idea. This guy was really a genius of drums. It’s impossible to explain where the snare and kick is – it’s like a fantastic salad, full of different little parts.He also brought a very good ambience to the studio – of international cool. Tony always wore a good outfit, super good sportswear. He was like a fantastic grandpa, kind of fragile but intense, and drinking a lot, smoking a lot. Like – a lot. The guy was always with a cloud of smoke around him. He was very discreet he never told me: “You know I played with Fela Kuti, you know I invented Afrobeat?” Mega humble, super nice, a high level of coolness. The outfits, the way he talks, the eyes: someone very cool and very intelligent. Small, polite, but with a huge aura.It was almost impossible to play this music on stage because I couldn’t find any drummer who could play the Tony parts. He was an old man, and it wasn’t really possible to do a tour like mine. So I always ask the new drummer: “Yeah, could you play La Ritournelle exactly like Tony?” And it was just impossible. It’s a very mysterious way to play drums. I guess it’s because he learned to play drums by himself, he didn’t take lessons, so he created another way to play.Drummers like him are why guys decided to make drum machines, because the beats were so complex. Tony’s music had a certain type of flow and rhythm that is like a piece of gold for a DJ: it would take a person to a higher level, and it didn’t matter who you were or what you liked or where you were from, it had a very universal effect.My manager told me that Tony Allen had rented out a studio in Paris and was inviting artists to come in and just jam. It was a very simple, brief meeting – he didn’t say much, we talked for a little bit, and then we set up and we started to play. And then we got into long conversations about everything – life and music.We toured together as a duo and there were no rehearsals – we just took to the stage and played what we felt. The set list was “spontaneity”, and to me, that’s the highest form of communicating through music. We talked about politics or something up until the second that we took the stage, and then when we played together, we were emphasising those thoughts because they were still in our heads.He was a very kind person. He always liked to tell you things he’s learned in the past, so that you don’t make the same mistake. One of the last conversations we had, I asked him if life, or this world, was as crazy then as it was now, and he said: “Yeah, it was always crazy.” That gave me a little bit of reassurance that we’re not experiencing anything unusual.After the first few performances, I went home, went to a music store and bought as much percussion as I could – as an electronic musician I was programming machines to the point where I never really used my hands. What I was really looking for was something I had in my own character, and I never would have realised that had I not listened to him. When it comes to showing a higher level of rhythm, and approaching that in a very organic way, I don’t think there’s anyone that I will meet that will show me as much as he did.I asked him to come and play on my 2003 album Love Trap. With my previous album, Salt Rain, I had explored an axis of Europe, India and Africa, and this was an extension of that – we managed to find a musical space that was big enough to house all of those different elements, and I think Tony was proud of achieving that. He knew a lot about music, more than just groove. Sometimes you would hear him playing at soundcheck and you’d feel this immense depth and weight, almost like it’s been going on forever. He once said to me, my drumming is never-ending, and that’s the feeling you got from him.He was very easy to play with – he didn’t have an ego. He wore his legend quite lightly, and was kind and charming. We share a birthday, and we would phone each other up each year for the last 15 years. When he came to London he would come and visit us, and play you his new music, and it was like … you know how teenagers are when they’ve got a new demo? He had that childlike demeanour. He was always so enthusiastic about life and music, he had a real zest for living.I first met him in 2016 and ever since I’d always run into him hanging or playing with someone. He was a lot of fun, and he had a lot of time for musicians. He was this funky, youthful 79-year-old. He became very uncle-like, and loved a good time, always had some whisky or weed.I’ve been lucky enough to meet and talk with a lot of the masters, like Roy Hargrove, Roy Haynes, James Moody, Jimmy Heath – they all had the same youthful inquisitiveness. Tony too, it felt like he was fresh and ready to take on whatever the show was. Not everyone’s blessed like that, some people get stuck in their thing, and that’s cool – they like to do what they do. But Tony always seemed wide open.In the mid-80s, I used to DJ at Electric Ballroom in Camden on a Friday night. Upstairs was what they called the jazz room, where all the dancers would dance off and battle. Two Fela Kuti tracks that Tony Allen played on, Roforofo Fight and Shakara, were two of the most essential tracks that I had. Not only were they incredible, but they were also long, and allowed for a serious battle to ensue.From Fatboy Slim playing Roforofo Fight at Glastonbury to Q-Tip playing it at Output to Louie Vega playing it in Tokyo, any DJ playing any kind of music, whether it’s hip-hop, house or disco, will have been saved at least once by a Tony Allen track. Whenever I saw him, I felt like I should pay him a percentage of my fee. The songs were generally quite long, so they always gave you enough time to get your head together – if you’re slightly nervous and need to settle into the zone, start with a Fela track. Or if you need a toilet break.His music worked at 90bpm as well as it worked at 140bpm, that was the other magic about it. Even the slower stuff – Water No Get Enemy, Fear Not for Man – is brutally powerful in the same way roots reggae is, or heavy dubstep by Mala. It was almost like he created a beat that was ahead of the drum machine, it was so constant. And if you’re used to dancing on the fourth beat, you can fall into a four within his beat, but if you want to dance to the offbeat, you can find that too. There’s several different rhythms to latch on to, depending on what you like. And that’s really powerful – he’s managed to incorporate the swing and the hypnotic, two very different areas. You really have to mess up, or the crowd has to really suck, if they don’t dance to Tony Allen records.Tony Allen marked all of my childhood – I used to dance a lot to his Afrobeat music. It was one of my dreams to collaborate with him and I finally realised it: he gifted me with his magic touch on my last album, Mogoya, playing drums on the tracks Yere Faga and Fadjamou. He is one of the most legendary musicians of all time because he knew how to play and adapt himself to all genres of music. He was a kind, generous and smart man. You marked your era, my brother. You will remain forever in our memories – rest in peace.I did a remix for him, and then got in touch with him to give me a good backbeat for the Moritz von Oswald Trio I had formed. I’m a drummer myself, and Tony was like somebody from another world. How he kept the beat, how steady it was, it was so upfront and so precise – he was like a drum machine with soul. He was playing not only beats, but melodies – his drums were singing, you know?In my studio, we set up my drum kit and he was so happy to sit behind it. It’s like I could feel his destination. It was so genius how he did his contributions to this steady electronic beat, how he loosened it up. He was never trying to put himself in the foreground, only support. And it was so complex. He was giving so much that it was almost enough on its own. I thought of making him the first person, changing the whole role of having a drummer. Usually a drummer is used as a backbeat, and I love that, but sometimes I was thinking to exchange these old conservative roles, and have him being the one that’s the main musician, and me add synth music to his playing. We never tried, but it would have been great to do it.His playing was impossible to copy because no one in the world would be able to play it. And it was so light, as if it was floating – maybe the same as his personality! We had some beautiful times together. He was kind of a father figure, always embracing people, very humble. Kind of the same as he was behind the kit. We talked about our problems we had some beautiful conversations about family and friendship. He was 75 when we played with him and we went to Japan, Australia, but he never argued or moaned. He was fighting through for playing, and you could see when you looked into his eyes that he really loved to play. He was a close friend – I felt like a son to him. And he was a genius, no?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/460de4785dddaa8f27d5249523afc0cb4422592b/0_157_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cb91480ca37bf60358edd5e9357534e","title":"the global race for face masks podcast","story":"The world economy may have dramatically dipped and the price of oil crashed, but one commodity is seeing an unprecedented boom: the face mask.

The firm could use antibody tests – proving whether someone has had the virus – or antigen tests, which show current infections.Digital identity experts say they are in the “discovery stage” of what could be tailored for the UK government, but developing a type of health certificate through app technology is gaining traction.The government is understood to be moving away from the phrase “immunity passport” as evidence continues to emerge on exactly how immunity develops after someone has had Covid-19. The World Health Organization has also issued a stark warning over attempts to give people false assurance through a passport scheme.On Monday, Boris Johnson will call on countries to come together in a “truly global effort” to defeat the coronavirus as he co-hosts a virtual Coronavirus Global Response International Pledging Conference, and confirms the UK’s promise of £388m funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments.It comes ahead of the prime minister outlining a “roadmap” out of lockdown, including the need to tackle workers’ fears of being in close proximity to others.These are lab-based tests, however, relying on blood to be taken by a medical professional and requiring large machines for analysis, taking time.Onfido, which is in talks with ministers, was founded by three former Oxford University students in 2012 and has worked with Monzo and Zipcar. It says it has the ability to roll out a system within months and could be the “linchpin of the new normality” and stimulating the economy.Their solution would embed Onfido technology within another organisation’s app to establish someone’s identity. The person would be asked to take a selfie and an image of their government-issued identification, such as a passport or driver’s licence. The technology can determine whether the person’s face matches their ID, and also if the ID is genuine. This creates a digital identity.They are then tested for coronavirus under a system endorsed by the government and the result is stored by another provider – in the UK this would most likely be the NHS.When the person goes to their workplace, they open the app, take a photo of their face and that unlocks a QR code. That QR code would be scanned by reception using simple camera technology and on their system they would see the test result and a photo of the employee’s face for a short time, allowing them to visually determine the identity of the person in front of them.The only technology a business would need to make this work would be a camera to take an image of the QR code as they arrive. No information about someone’s name, date of birth, address would be visible to the person on reception, only that they are fit to go into work.There are remaining questions about the extent to which the presence of antibodies in the blood ensures immunity. Early reports of apparent Covid-19 reinfections in South Korea now appear to have been explained by a combination of false negative results and because the body’s healing response can lead to infected cells from the lungs being expelled weeks after initial infection, causing people to test positive even though they are recovering.However, many experts still think it likely that immunity will wane over a period of months or years, potentially leaving people vulnerable – and some people could acquire more robust immunity than others.A government source said a form of certification system is “still on the table and being considered” and that conversations around this concept fall under the government’s “track and trace” plans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b75ef7cb620abb2e2c647c6e4644e520f848ff60/0_171_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=100ebca3fb5c31f8fc6a29b1114f83a7","title":"half of british adults felt anxious about covid 19 lockdown","story":"Health, making ends meet and job security among worries highlighted in ONS pollMore than 25 million people reported high levels of anxiety in late March as the decision to put the UK into lockdown triggered fears about health, job security and making ends meet among half the adult population.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said its regular update on wellbeing showed the number of people over 16 reporting deep levels of concern and stress had more than doubled since late 2019.According to the ONS, people’s main concerns were personal wellbeing, their jobs and the impact of Covid-19 on their finances as normal working life was suspended for all but essential workers.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The release of the official wellbeing data comes as the government grapples with how to lift the restrictions, enforced from 24 March, and will add to concerns about the psychological impact of the lockdown.Of those worried about the impact of coronavirus on their lives, the survey suggested about 5.3 million people were most concerned about the effect on their finances 8.5 million were most concerned about their wellbeing, including boredom, loneliness and stress and 6.2 million were most concerned about their jobs.Among other concerns cited were the effect of the lockdown on education, relationships and caring responsibilities.With the lockdown now well into its second month, the ONS said there had been a drop-back in the numbers reporting high anxiety, although they remained well above pre-crisis levels.The average anxiety rating was 2.97 in the fourth quarter of 2019, increased to 5.18 in late March, and fell to 4.2 by mid-April.It added that people who rented and the self-employed were more likely to have had their household finances and their jobs negatively affected by the pandemic, through reduced income, having to use savings to cover living costs, reduced working hours, and the inability to save for the future.Lucy Tinkler, the head of the ONS’s quality of life team, said: “All measures of personal wellbeing, which include anxiety and happiness, are at their worst levels since we began collecting data in 2011.“This was particularly the case for those who have already been financially affected, as well as those renting and the self-employed. The most recent data showed a slight improvement in anxiety compared to previous weeks, but remained much higher than before the pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de9ef49ed45bd8b2f7deba78adf5d1889e767c09/0_174_3216_1930/master/3216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24f6921a100931ce3258b0d16d8c4ce9","title":"michael jordan espn last dance republicans sneakers quote nba","story":"Michael Jordan has discussed the quote that has come to define what many see as his willingness to put profit over principles.During a 1990 Senate race in his home state of North Carolina, Jordan refused to endorse Democrat Harvey Gantt, an African American who was running against the incumbent Republican Jesse Helms, a notorious racist. Jordan, who at the time had already won the first of his five NBA MVP awards, explained away his refusal to take a stance by saying “Republicans buy sneakers, too”.In an episode of ESPN documentary The Last Dance broadcast on Sunday, Jordan said he understood why he could be seen as selfish but the comment was a joke.“I don’t think that statement needs to be corrected because I said it in jest on a bus with Horace Grant and Scottie Pippen,” Jordan said. “It was thrown off the cuff. My mother asked to do a PSA for Harvey Gantt, and I said, ‘Look, Mom, I’m not speaking out of pocket about someone that I don’t know. But I will send a contribution to support him.’ Which is what I did.“I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in. But I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player. I wasn’t a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That’s where my energy was.”Jordan’s stance is often seen as a stark contrast to the greatest player of the current era, LeBron James. James has spoken out on issues such as gun violence and has attacked the presidency of Donald Trump.Barack Obama was also interviewed for the documentary and said that he had been disappointed with Jordan’s comments at the time.“I’ll be honest, when it was reported that Michael said, ‘Republicans buy sneakers, too’ – for somebody who was at that time preparing for a career in civil rights law and knowing what Jesse Helms stood for, you would’ve wanted to see Michael push harder on that,” Obama said. “On the other hand, he was still trying to figure out, ‘How am I managing this image that has been created around me, and how do I live up to it?’”Jordan said that it was up to his fans whether to follow his lead. “The way I go about my life is I set examples,” he said. “If it inspires you? Great, I will continue to do that. If it doesn’t? Then maybe I’m not the person you should be following.”Jordan has spoken out on social issues in recent years, while still largely staying away from controversial topics. In 2018, he said he supported James after Trump attacked the then Cleveland Cavaliers star on Twitter. He also backed NFL players who kneeled during the national anthem to protest against racial injustice in the United States.“Those who exercise the right to peacefully express themselves should not be demonized or ostracized,” Jordan said in September 2017. “At a time of increasing isiveness and hate in this country, we should be looking for ways to work together and support each other and not create more ision.”Jordan is widely acknowledged as the greatest basketball player of all time. He won six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls and was a 14-time All Star.

The feeling of euphoria will never be betteredIt is the moments you never expect that have the greatest impact on your life whether it’s meeting eyes with your future life partner for the first time, winning the lottery or Sergio Agüero scoring the most dramatic goal in Premier League history to give the title to your once mediocre club.The equation was supposed to be so simple, as everyone bounced to the Etihad in anticipation of witnessing the crowning of Manchester City as Premier League champions for the first time, beating arch-rivals United to top spot in the process. The only requirement for City was to dispatch a relegation-threatened Queens Park Rangers in front of 46,000 vocal home supporters, who were cheering on the most exciting and expensive side in the club’s history.What followed was a tumultuous 90 minutes with a crescendo unimaginable to all those in attendance. The party had kicked up a gear when Pablo Zabaleta put City ahead in the 39th minute by whacking the ball through Paddy Kenny’s hands. Having a cult hero score the opener with a rare goal was surely a sign that triumph was in sight. A carefree atmosphere was created in the stands nothing could go wrong from this point.City, however, have never had much respect for their fans’ health. Joleon Lescott was the first culprit as his attempted headed clearance flicked the ball into the path of Djibril Cissé, who whacked in the equaliser to silence the home supporters. Resilient shouts soon went up to inspire the players as hope remained.QPR had packed their side full of City academy graduates including Shaun Wright-Phillips, Nedum Onuoha and the gloriously vicious Joey Barton. It was the aggressive midfielder who lifted the crowd with trademark volatility by elbowing Carlos Tevez in the face, allowing Mike Dean to really enjoy the moment of holding a red card aloft. Job done for City with 10 men to play against for the remaining 35 minutes.Then, however, the panic and dismay arrived, after Jamie Mackie headed QPR into the lead at the back post. The party had turned into a wake and the only thing that could get things back on track was the introduction of Edin Dzeko and Mario Balotelli.United were winning at Sunderland, giving them the edge as City camped inside QPR’s half in the hope of finding an opening. Heads were hidden behind hands as hope slipped away when the clock ticked past the 90-minute mark.Anger and upset grew that the greatest season in a generation would be remembered for glorious failure. Dzeko heading home an equaliser in the second minute of injury time was highly frustrating because it seemed too little too late. Cheers and fist pumps greeted the Bosnian’s goal, leaving many frustrated that he had not done it 10 minutes earlier.QPR seemed intent on inviting pressure because their top-flight status was secure, leaving them carefree. There was still time for City to swarm forward and have one crucial last chance. The ball was forced to the edge of the area, Balotelli held it up and squirmed it into the path of Agüero. The Argentinian could have shot first time but shimmied to get more space and then the world froze, clocks stopped and his backlift felt like a slow-motion Lego re-enactment until his boot struck the ball. We knew it was beyond Kenny and into the net. Agüero’s shirt was off, the foundations of the stadium were shaking and the feeling of utter euphoria felt at that second will never be bettered.Being there was a privilege and something that will not be forgotten. Amid all of the money in football, it was a reminder of the beauty and excitement of the sport in its purest form."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d01e78454ccde187f79d883c324c864c19d62a7/0_782_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d4194c499a6308c27305fc3e463851b","title":"homemakers review black comedy gothic horror covid 19","story":"Available onlineAd Infinitum conjure a surreal world from the Covid-19 pandemic, while Bryony Kimmings unravels flamboyantlyThe task set for artists in the Homemakers series was to create works in isolation for an audience in isolation. It is not the first initiative of its kind there is a growing body of work exploring the drama, or malaise, of being cooped up alone. So it is all the more surprising that the first films in this ongoing series commissioned by Home in Manchester look and feel so original.A Small Gathering is made up of three short films in which everyday objects synonymous with the Covid-19 pandemic, from toilet roll and antibacterial spray to perennial cups of tea, are woven into stories about paranoid, hostile and hallucinatory states of mind in imaginative and witty ways.The stories are frightening and funny in equal measure, careering from realism into a stylised and surreal world of black comedy, gothic horror and fantasy. They are playful from the start, calling themselves “a triptych of shorts served two metres apart” and using techniques from silent films to capture an overt theatricality on film. But for all their whimsy, the surreal and absurdist elements resonate with the strangeness of lockdown: its emotional disorientations and the unpinning of the old, fixed realities.Created by Ad Infinitum, they are non-verbal, accompanied by Sam Halmarack’s mood-setting sound design and artfully mimed by actors.Nothing is quite what it seems: the ordinary ritual of hand-washing becomes a sexual act as a bar of lathered soap slips between gripping fists in “Mr Pink”. It is created by Nir Paldi and George Mann, and performed by Paldi whose character – part seaside entertainer, part artiste – finds himself marooned indoors, washing his hands in a grunting frenzy and veering from cute comic mime to flashes of imagined violence or fear.Toilet rolls take on ominous overtones in “Rewilding”, directed and performed by Deb Pugh and featuring a nervy character preparing to venture out of her home, disinfectant spray in hand. A tea party for dolls is animated by demon possession in “Cynthia’s Party”, directed and performed by Charlotte Dubery, in which a circle of sinister-looking dolls turn on their owner with the schlocky melodrama of a B-movie.Like “Mr Pink”, this last film is concerned with performance and Dubery’s character resembles a music-hall entertainer in gly socks and glittery shoes who has no audience to entertain.Bryony Kimmings’ 15-minute film, “I am falling in love with you and it’s making me do stupid things,” features another flamboyant unravelling. Performed by Kimmings and edited by Will Duke, it takes place in the space of a single night in which Kimmings’ character make a series of video calls in the hope of connecting romantically: “I hope you remember me … Sorry I never emailed you. I did want to but got embarrassed.”That first message is followed by another with a glass of wine in hand: “I notice you haven’t messaged me back.” The next 10 calls go through the full revolution of an imaginary relationship, from a first-date dinner to drunken clubbing, pillow talk and separation, complete with accusations of betrayal and smeared mascara. A high point comes with Tom Parkinson’s bubble-gum pop song sung by Kimmings and accompanied by computerised visual effects so that it looks and sounds like a retro pop video.If this is an audacious show of seduction, femininity is part of the performance: Kimmings’ character dresses as different kinds of women in order to allure, from demure girlfriend to drunken party girl and we know little of who she is beneath the identities she assumes in her elaborate game of dress-up.It might amount to a painful picture of sexual desperation but we begin to suspect, in the final twist, that the performance of sexiness is orchestrated for this character’s own amusement. Just like the ailing performers in A Small Gathering, she needs an audience, however virtual, and her admirers serve that purpose.Other works in the series so far include Homelands by Plaster Cast Theatre, in which contributors are posted a short story that invites a written response, and Tell Me by Chris Thorpe and Yusra Wasarma, a question and answer game played by two people that tests the extent of their intimacy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78b6b8f819e484018680d1113278877b4ff463c3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed117c4ae7aaa040ae8dd63ee4bca330","title":"new lockdown dramas virtual collaborators covid 19","story":"Danusia Samal’s Virtual Collaborators series continues with five new short films that look at life on the Covid-19 frontline and in the front roomHottest front-room seats: the best theatre and dance onlineAn intensive care doctor reflects on a week on the Covid-19 frontline, a lonely woman wonders when she will next eat a meal with company and all Anya wants is some space for herself in the bedroom-turned-office she shares with her boyfriend. These are some of the scenarios – familiar from the news or from our daily experience – in a set of new lockdown dramas released online on Monday.Actor and writer Danusia Samal launched her Virtual Collaborators series last month with nine short films, written and directed during the lockdown by creatives who have found their other projects put on hold by theatre’s shutdown. Five more films have now been made available. Samal’s own Me … Me opens with a Sanskrit proverb: “If your expectation for connection is not met – that’s when loneliness strikes.” The film follows a day in a confined life, from a morning scroll through social media in bed to Netflix, home exercise routine, TikTok lols and dinner.It’s performed by Iniki Mariano, who said the project has been “a heartbeat in the silent graveyard of what felt like a dead industry”. For Mariano, it was unlike any other acting gig. “We found ourselves having to be more than what we thought our roles were – for me, this meant being DP, sound recordist, continuity supervisor and wardrobe mistress … It has certainly made me more aware of the machinations of film-making beyond the actor’s perspective, and I am sure has made me a better, more appreciative actor.” The piece’s director, Atri Banerjee, said that working from a distance was “an interesting challenge” but that the process had reflected the film’s themes of alienation. “In the film, it’s almost like we’re watching the protagonist from the perspective of her computer and phone screens.”Two of the short films consider life for medics during the crisis. The People Under the Moon is the first script written by the actor Anjli Mohindra, who played Nadia in the the first series of the BBC’s Bodyguard. Her piece, The People Under the Moon, directed by Hal Chambers, asks how to find intimacy in a time of social distancing and features Gwilym Lee as a junior doctor. Ryan Craig’s monologue Proof of Life is directed by Harry Tennison and stars Zoe Zak as an intensive care doctor who is recording a message for a judgmental family member with whom she has an acrimonious relationship. It charts her quest for control and peace in her personal life at a time of huge professional stress, when sick patients have died alone without the comfort of their family’s presence.Nalân Burgess’s comedy Good Connection? is directed by Hana Keegan and has an ultra-relatable scenario in which the fraught Anya (Olivia Dodd) finds her personal and professional lives colliding. She attempts to be businesslike with colleagues while also Zooming her mum and sharing her space with her boyfriend (Priyank Morjaria). All she really wants is a Pret lunch and some time to herself.Burgess said that when theatres closed in mid-March it “led to an abrupt end to rehearsals for a show we had been working on for weeks and a complete lifestyle change, trading in the rehearsal room for my bedroom: laptop life and even constructing a desk, the actor’s nemesis.” Like some of the other Virtual Collaborators, she has written one film and acted in another. “During such an emotionally turbulent time, it has been so comforting to connect with other caged creatives, working on two projects, one as an actress and one pushing myself out of my comfort zone as a writer, happily occupying several hours of lockdown life.”How we spend the extra time that may have become available to us during lockdown is explored in A Birthday Wish, written by Frances McNamee and directed by Ellie Hurt. In the lead role, Joseph Adelakun looks back on a day watching Power Rangers and eating cereal on his own. Shouldn’t he be writing his novel, he asks, while also reflecting on his need for daily human interaction, even if it’s just at the supermarket checkout.Samal was inspired to create the drama series when the  invited her to contribute an idea to an article proposing an “action plan for theatre” after venues were closed by coronavirus. “Mental health is as important as physical in this trying time,” she wrote. “We need to stay creative – that doesn’t have to be alone. Technology can keep us collaborating remotely.” Hers is one of an explosion of online theatre projects to have emerged in the last six weeks. For his series We Will Not Be Silenced, playwright Brian Coyle is penning short monologues about life during the pandemic, which have been self-filmed by actors. Eight have been made so far. The writer and actor Jasmine Naziha Jones has dreamed up Open Soap, an improvised supermarket sitcom created by actors and comedians in isolation. “So far we have six episodes and enough submissions for a pretty wild story arc,” she says.Me … Me director Iniki Mariano recommends the benefits of collaborating remotely during the lockdown. “We truly are more powerful together. That idea you might have, that story you might have always wanted to tell, or that desire to make something even though you have no clue how to start, you don’t have to do it alone – all you have to do is find another creative, and ask!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98647a74866317f6b7bf6eac97085054eac8247d/95_0_2219_1329/master/2219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28d53c10291a55c8b7bdb15ab12be3c7","title":"i love presenting nigerias deal or no deal john fashanus lockdown tv","story":"The footballer-turned-television presenter on the educational benefits of 90 Day Fiancé, and why watching his own gameshow makes him emotionalI’ve been spending my lockdown watching 90 Day Fiancé (TLC) with my partner. It’s very exciting, humorous and real. I love that the couples have never met each other before but are prepared to get married almost straight away – it’s such a simple but entertaining premise. They are all just random people from all over the world trying to make love work, which as most people know is not easy. Trying to fall in love with somebody you have never met in your life is almost impossible so all the couples are fascinating to watch. At the end of the day, very few of them make it.It’s a lesson to all of us to find someone who really knows you, because if there is distance in a marriage it just won’t function. As much as it is very funny and the couples have lots of arguments though, this is real life and it is often how marriages are. A marriage can be full of disagreements, or it might be that you don’t have love and you only got married because you were looking for something. It is almost educational for myself and my partner, since I have been married once and orced, so when you go into it a second time, you want to make sure you know what you want.I have been living in Nigeria for 14 years now, ever since I finished presenting Gladiators. So as well as 90 Day Fiancé, I also watch some of the local TV, including my own show here, which is Deal or No Deal. I started presenting the Nigerian version at the same time as Noel did in the UK. It is massively popular and I watch myself to make sure I’m getting better at what I do. It is so lovely to see people who are not affluent suddenly come into money on the show – when you see that look on their faces and they are crying, it is almost impossible to not get emotional myself. We are helping them to have a new start in life and that really is the best feeling in the world.Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins is on Channel 4, Mondays at 9pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/144d95bfde80c14215958759f23290ab09550fc8/0_541_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17065c3e76003dd9882252f4d644f96c","title":"kent state massacre marked start of americas polarization","story":"The killing of four white students 50 years ago brought the anti-Vietnam protests global attention. The killing of black students at the same time went unnoticedTo Lou Capecci, the crack of the national guard’s guns sounded like more of the same.“It was pretty common to have demonstrations every day. The national guard had been on campus for a few days. They would shoot tear gas into the middle of the crowd and people would throw it back at them. Then we heard the shots and at first everybody kind of shrugged their shoulders and thought more tear gas,” he said.But the young student at Kent State University in Ohio was mistaken.Fifty years ago today, 28 soldiers opened fire on anti-Vietnam war demonstrators, letting loose 67 bullets in just 13 seconds. Four students were killed, nine wounded, and a fissure exposed in American society that shaped politics into the Trump era.To large parts of the country, the Kent State massacre was a shocking and seminal event – American soldiers gunning down white students was unthinkable until it happened.Part of the shock for Capecci, who walked away from the demonstration minutes before the national guard fired, was that he thought the soldiers’ weapons were just for show.“No one knew the national guard had real bullets. We were completely shocked. It just never occurred to anyone that they would actually have bullets to shoot people. It may sound naive but we talked about that for years afterwards,” he said.It was naive. In other parts of the country, the police were killing African Americans protesting for equal rights, including on college campuses before and immediately after Kent State with little attention from the television cameras that gave saturation coverage to the deaths of the white students.There was a second shock to come for Capecci and other anti-war protesters. A majority of Americans sided with the national guard because, whatever the country’s feelings about an increasingly unpopular war, the protesters had come to represent something much more objectionable.Fairly or not, the students were increasingly seen as allied with violence in an age of riots and revolutionary groups including The Weathermen and a faction led by Sam Melville that, between January 1969 and the Kent State massacre, committed 4,330 bombings against federal buildings and corporations in the US, killing 43 people.That ision was made all too clear as hundreds of anti-war protesters marched through New York City four days after Kent State. A large group of construction workers taunted them as anti-American and then attacked with crowbars in what became known as “The Hardhat Riot”. Dozens were injured but President Richard Nixon understood the political advantage of siding with blue collar workers against students he called “bums”.David Paul Kuhn, author of The Hardhat Riot: Nixon, New York City and the Dawn of the White Working-Class Revolution, said America is still living with the isions laid bare in that first week of May 1970.“If there’s an era when the tribalisation of the Trump era began, it’s this time,” he said. “Between Kent State and the hardhat riot you have the best microcosm that there is of the beginning of the polarisation that haunts America today.”Eva Paterson was an African American anti-war and civil rights student leader at Northwestern University in Illinois who rapidly emerged as a national figure for fostering non-violent protest in the aftermath of Kent State.“The way it was framed, it was the students’ fault. I was on a plane reading that and my eyes were just bugging out of my head going, wait, the kids are dead and you’re blaming them? But the country was similarly polarised as today, although Nixon seems like a saint compared to Trump,” she said.“After Dr King was assassinated in April of ’68 the cities were burning. There was a lot of violence. I know people who are now distinguished law professors who burned down a building at Northwestern. They burned it down to the ground and they were trying to burn out another building. Students with rifles at Cornell were protesting. We did feel like a revolution was clearly needed. We thought it was happening.”The confrontation was frequently cast as a generational ide at the time. But Kuhn sees it as driven by a ision many Americans are even more reluctant to talk about than race – class.Kuhn said blue collar workers often shared the students’ opposition to the Vietnam war but had little time for young men who talked about social justice while using their privilege to avoid the draft. “Blue collar Americans didn’t like this war, but they didn’t like the anti-war movement more,” said Kuhn. “There was a frustration with the anti-war movement, of the indignity of moral certitude without sacrifice. A lot of Americans didn’t feel like there was an honesty about that fact.”Kuhn said anger at the anti-war movement was also steeped in years of frustration at what was regarded as its rejection of American values.“The sense back then was not only of condescension toward middle Americans themselves but also their values. That resonates tremendously with sentiment at the dawn of Donald Trump and that will be with us after him.”Capecci was one of those students who dodged the draft – along with Bill Clinton, George W Bush, Dick Cheney and others in a future generation of political leaders on the left and right – by joining a part-time reserve army unit even though he was sympathetic to the anti-war effort.“I managed to serve out my commitment for six years in Akron rather than in Vietnam. We knew the last thing you wanted was to be drafted because then you’d be sent out for cannon fodder,” he said.In Paterson’s view, the construction workers may have been agitated about the students’ failure to serve but she sees political manipulation by the Nixon administration as it implemented its “Southern strategy” to win over disillusioned Democratic voters, a drive rooted in racism that gave birth to the Reagan revolution and paved the road to Trump.Paterson gained national recognition when she testified before Congress and then appeared in a television debate with Nixon’s vice president, Spiro Agnew, who three years later was convicted of corruption and resigned. Paterson explained to Congress what might motivate students to burn down buildings although she strongly opposed violence. But her testimony was characterised in the press as justifying the attacks. Not long after, she debated Agnew.“I think they thought they hit the jackpot with me. I’m a brown-skinned black woman with an afro who they thought was a crazy radical person. I was not. Agnew kept pulling out these clippings and saying, ‘Miss Paterson you said you think buildings should be burned down’. And I kept saying, that’s not what I said. I said I explained why people could do that,” she said.“That fall they unveiled the Southern strategy. I think that debate was supposed to be kind of a kick-off to that to show here are these crazy people and this one’s black. You can’t trust the Democrats so come to the Republican party.”Race shaped the legacy of Kent State in other ways too. The massacre was not the first mass shooting on campus by men in uniform.Two years earlier, police in South Carolina opened fire on African American students at the state university in Orangeburg protesting against racial segregation in the town. The police arrived well armed, including some who brought shotguns from home loaded with buckshot for killing deer. They left three African Americans in their teens dead and 27 other people wounded.In contrast to Kent State, the killings received little national press coverage. Federal prosecutors charged nine of the police officers with using excessive force but they were acquitted after claiming students shot even though there was no evidence.The only person to go to prison over what became known as The Orangeburg massacre was Cleveland Sellers, a student rights leader who was shot in the shoulder and later convicted of rioting.His son, Bakari Sellers, a lawyer who served in the South Carolina state legislature, said the Orangeburg killings could have been taken as a warning that pulling guns on unarmed demonstrators “never ends with good results”.“The Orangeburg massacre was a true tragedy,” he said. “If the lessons had been learned from Orangeburg and it wasn’t hidden, both by the state of South Carolina and the FBI, we could have avoided Kent State.”Kent State wasn’t the end of such killings either.Eleven days later, Mississippi police fired hundreds of shots at students at Jackson State College, killing two and wounding 12. Again, the police claimed to have come under fire but federal investigators found no evidence of it.A presidential commission investigating campus unrest concluded that the police fusillade at Jackson State “was an unreasonable, unjustified overreaction”. But Sellers, author of My Vanishing Country, said those killings are largely forgotten because of who died.“Kent State is a story that people know, people can learn from, whereas Orangeburg and Jackson, because they happened on black college campuses, are stories that go untold,” he said.Paterson, who trained as a lawyer and went on to a life of civil rights activism, said the legacy of Kent State and the anti-war movement radicalised members of a generation, the baby boomers, who are often maligned these days as only out for themselves.“It was a time for us to be militant and we were militant. Once you have done something like that, you are changed forever and you feel like you can take on state power and protest against the government. So I think for some of us, it changed us irrevocably. For others, it was just a blip,” she said.“There’s also a more abstract general lesson that I took away from the whole movement. When I entered Northwestern, I supported the war fully. Over time, I listened to people and heard stories and thought about statistics and changed my mind, which is why I’m hopeful that we can get people who might have voted for Obama and then Trump to change their mind. That whole experience led me to understand people can change deeply held views with enough information.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We want to hear from those who attended mega-events such as Cheltenham Festival and the Stereophonics concerts in CardiffWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead during the week beginning 9 March.Those events include: the Cheltenham Festival, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, and the Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff.Do you believe that you were infected by coronavirus by attending one of these events?You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

Neither China nor the US attended the hastily assembled earlier summit, which also included the World Health Organization.The US president, Donald Trump, who is at loggerheads with the WHO and China over what he has called a conspiracy to cover up the origin of the virus, had been urged to support the summit. But optimism that the US might relent and join the initiative had waned by Monday morning.Melinda Gates, a critic of the absence of US leadership on global health, has warned: “If there is Covid anywhere, there is Covid everywhere. If vaccinations are not distributed everywhere, relapses can occur everywhere”.The UK strongly supports the project and attended the 24 April event. Its prime minister Boris Johnson will tell the conference: “The more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It’s humanity against the virus - we are in this together, and together we will prevail.”The initiative is designed to broaden the work of an existing organisation, set up in 2017 in the wake of the Ebola outbreak, known as the Global Coalition on Epidemic Preparedness Innovations focused on vaccine research. The new body will have a remit to include testing and therapies for those with the disease.The leaders hope to follow the model of the Global Vaccine and Immunisation Alliance (Gavi), which has negotiated with companies that develop vaccines for 20 years, lowering the price by guaranteeing long-term markets and large volumes. Gavi has helped fund the immunisation of 20 million children worldwide.A global pandemic board, operating independently, but in partnership with the World Health Organization, will have the support of the G20 group of countries. Separate subgroups will be set up to coordinate work on vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Sir Andrew Whitty, the former chief executive officer of GlaxoSmithKline, has agreed to be a special envoy for the group.The aim is to funnel research into five or six vaccines before moving towards mass manufacturing of the two that show the most promise. The WHO estimates as many as 89 vaccines are in development globally, including seven in clinical evaluation and some therapeutics in clinical trials. To hasten the process, the group aims to subsidise manufacture of drugs before final clinical trials are complete. The final costs could be as high as $40bn.The launch meeting last week agreed on the principles of Covid therapeutics research sharing and equitable distribution.A joint call for action that also backs the role of the WHO has been signed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, French president, Emmanuel Macron, Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, European council, president Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European commission. All three EU national leaders have experienced a surge in popularity since the crisis started, but now face the difficulty of managing an easing of the lockdown without a ready vaccine.Their pre-summit joint statement says the aim is to “bring together the world’s best – and most prepared – minds to find the vaccines, treatments and therapies we need to make our world healthy again, while strengthening the health systems that will make them available for all, with a particular attention to Africa.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5151a81a9a8ca3a3c2a3908f0ff9b7f5ce6f5e/68_387_5025_3015/master/5025.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff853394a30260a520ae1c5a1ab312e0","title":"happy hypoxia unusual coronavirus effect baffles doctors","story":"Some patients who appear not in distress are found to have dangerously low oxygen levelsIt is a mystery that has left doctors questioning the basic tenets of biology: Covid-19 patients who are talking and apparently not in distress, but who have oxygen levels low enough to typically cause unconsciousness or even death.The phenomenon, known by some as “happy hypoxia” (some prefer the term “silent”) is raising questions about exactly how the virus attacks the lungs and whether there could be more effective ways of treating such patients.“It’s intriguing to see so many people coming in, quite how hypoxic they are,” said Dr Jonathan Bannard-Smith, a consultant in critical care and anaesthesia at Manchester Royal Infirmary. “We’re seeing oxygen saturations that are very low and they’re unaware of that. We wouldn’t usually see this phenomenon in influenza or community-acquired pneumonia. It’s very much more profound and an example of very abnormal physiology going on before our eyes.”Dr Mike Charlesworth, an anaesthetist at Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester, said that while other lung conditions could cause severe hypoxia, these patients would normally appear extremely ill. “With pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism they wouldn’t be sat up in bed talking to you,” he said. “We just don’t understand it. We don’t know if it’s causing organ damage that we’re not able to detect. We don’t understand if the body’s compensating.”Charlesworth had a personal experience of the issue while suffering from Covid-19 in March. After becoming unwell with a cough and fever, he spent 48 hours in bed, during which there were signs he was hypoxic, he said. “I was sending very strange messages on my phone. I was essentially delirious. Looking back I probably should’ve come into hospital. I’m pretty sure my oxygen levels were low. My wife commented that my lips were very dusky. But I was probably hypoxic and my brain probably wasn’t working very well.”He recovered after a few days in bed, but he and others are conscious that not all cases have positive outcomes.However, it is not the fall in oxygen levels itself that leaves people feeling breathless. Instead, the body senses the rising levels of carbon dioxide that typically occur simultaneously as the lungs are unable to clear gas as efficiently. But in some Covid-19 patients, this response does not appear to be kicking in.“I don’t think any of us expect that what we’re seeing can be explained by one process,” said Bannard-Smith.Swelling and inflammation in the lungs is likely to make it difficult for oxygen to enter the bloodstream. There is also emerging evidence that Covid-19 can cause blood clotting. The vessels in the lungs that collect oxygen and transfer it into the wider bloodstream are so tiny they can become blocked with the smallest of clots.Several clinical trials are looking at whether blood thinners could prevent or treat complications of Covid-19, including respiratory problems and low blood oxygen.Some have suggested that, since people are often oblivious to falling oxygen levels, those with Covid-19 symptoms or a positive test result should be given pulse oximeters, a simple device that clips on to the finger and can be used to detect oxygen levels at home. However, as yet there is no evidence that early detection of hypoxia would help avoid severe outcomes and Charlesworth said the practicalities would be difficult.

However, this is also what helped to make the diagnosis as the case was so striking.”Malara was looking at the lungs of Italy’s “patient 1”, the first confirmed case of domestic transmission of the virus in a country where it would go on to kill nearly 29,000 people. Until that day, Malara said, the coronavirus seemed like something that was so remote, only happening in China and other Asian countries as the rest of the world watched from a distance.“Yes, we had guidelines and we spoke about it, but nobody could ever have imagined that it would spread so much in Italy,” she said.Testing at the time was only for those who had returned from China, and Malara had to bend the guidelines to order a Covid-19 swab for Maestri. When the result came back it prompted both the closure of the hospital’s emergency wing and a government order to quarantine the entire town south of Milan, marking Europe’s first coronavirus lockdown.Maestri had had symptoms typical of coronavirus – a fever, cough and shortness of breath – for about 10 days before he first visited the hospital. An initial X-ray showed there was slight pneumonia on his right lung. He was given antibiotics and asked if he wanted to stay in hospital, but he declined. His symptoms worsened and a few hours later he returned and was immediately admitted and given oxygen therapy. Malara was called by her colleagues for advice during Maestri’s CT scan.Another detail that prompted the test emerged during a conversation with Maestri’s wife, who was eight months pregnant. Maestri had told doctors several times that his last trip abroad was to New York in September but his wife then recalled that a few weeks earlier he was at a dinner with a colleague who had recently returned from China. The colleague did not present any symptoms at the time and tested negative for the virus.The diagnosis caught the whole of Italy off-guard, despite the country’s first cases being detected in late January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive in Rome. During the intervening period, life had mostly carried on as usual. There was the occasional report of an Italian “possibly” having the virus, only for it to turn out to be a false alarm.Two days after Codogno was quarantined, nine other Lombardy towns went into lockdown, along with one in the Veneto region, where Italy’s first coronavirus death occurred.Massimo Galli, the director of infectious diseases at the Luigi Sacco hospital in Milan, said in the week after the diagnosis that the virus may have been circulating in the quarantined areas of northern Italy for weeks before it was detected by Malara’s test.Maestri recovered, as did his wife and the two Chinese visitors. Malara has spoken to Maestri over the phone, and said he is doing well. He became a father a few weeks ago. But tragically, before he was discharged from hospital his father died of Covid-19 in his hometown of Castiglione d’Adda.On 3 March, Costantino Pesatori, the mayor of Castiglione d’Adda, one of the 10 quarantined towns, posted a video appeal for help. Up until that point, most people in Italy were still very confused about the largely unknown threat, at that time mainly known in the west through reports from China. The virus was killing people and beginning to overwhelm hospitals, but the early deaths seemed to reflect a similar pattern: older people with underlying health issues. While leaders of some towns and cities were encouraging citizens to fight against the fear – by going to bars, restaurants and shops – Pesatori knew better.“I knew straight away how serious it was because from the day the epidemic was discovered in Codogno people in my town were dying,” he said. “If you consider two or three people a day dying in a town of 4,600, this is not normal.”Pesatori’s plea revealed details of the virus’s devastating impact, which until then had mostly been under the radar. Eighteen people died in the town within less than a fortnight, including a 55-year-old man with no known underlying illnesses. With three of the town’s five doctors quarantined and two in hospital, there was nobody to tend to those who were sick at home.“The situation was really worrying,” Pesatori said. “I understood that this was something new and difficult to manage, but many mayors were without support and because people elsewhere didn’t understand how serious things were, they felt they were free to carry on as normal.”Two military doctors were sent to the town on 11 March, two days after the whole of Lombardy was quarantined, a move that prompted thousands to flee south. It was also the day Italy became the first country to enforce a nationwide lockdown. By that stage, 827 people in Italy had died and more than 12,000 were infected. It was a move many had believed could never be ordered in a democracy without the means to coerce its citizens, but within weeks it was replicated across the continent and worldwide as the number of deaths rose.As Pesatori struggled to help his citizens, his family was struck: his mother, who died on 25 March, is among the town’s 76 fatalities.“I learned through all of this that you have to hold your nerve,” he said. “Despite my pain I had to look forward, for our future generation but also to ensure health is protected.”Although people are still in hospital, both the emergency and contagion rate have subsided. “But the virus is still circulating, and so we can’t completely drop our guard,” said Pesatori.While attention was focused on Codogno during the first two weeks of its confirmed outbreak, a more discrete drama was unfolding in Bergamo, a province north of Milan. The first case of coronavirus was detected at a hospital in Alzano Lombardo on 23 February, but Bergamo only went into lockdown with the rest of the Lombardy region on 8 March. It quickly became Italy’s most severely affected province.“There are no more beds here.” These were the last words Ettore Consonni, 61, a retired warehouse worker, heard before slipping into a coma at a hospital in Bergamo.Consonni was admitted on 4 March, not long after returning from the Dominican Republic where he and his wife celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary.Back in Italy, he began developing the Covid-19 symptoms of fever and shortness of breath. A test confirmed the worst.At that stage of the outbreak, well-resourced hospitals across Lombardy and in the second worst-affected region of Emilia-Romagna were struggling to cope, with intensive care beds dwindling as the infection spread.In an attempt to manage the emergency, sick people were placed in operating rooms or hospital corridors, while others were airlifted on military planes to southern Italy.When Consonni awoke after 23 days in a coma, he was in Sicily.“I thought it was a joke,” he said. “I fell asleep in Bergamo, my city in the extreme north, and I woke up in Palermo, in the deep south. I heard accents among the medical staff, but I thought it was simply the many Sicilian health professionals who work in Bergamo. Then they took me to the window and I saw it was no joke.”Consonni shared a ward at the Benfratelli hospital with other patients from the north. “The doctors told me I almost died,” he said. “That’s why I’m glad I don’t remember anything from those days.”Eventually discharged from intensive care, by early April he was breathing normally. A second test came back negative and on 21 April Consonni left hospital amid resounding applause.“I’m going to have Sicily tattooed on my skin because I was given a second life here.”Consonni arrived home to more applause from family and neighbours, despite noticing a peculiar look on their faces. “I knew something really bad had happened. My wife sat me down and told me that my brother had died of Covid-19.”Consonni realised that while he was fighting for his life, life in Bergamo had descended into heartbreak. Doctors compared the situation to war, with one medic claiming that saving a life was decided by age and health conditions.The sirens never stopped, church bells rang for each of the dead. Coffins stacked up in churches and, with cemeteries full, some were taken by military truck for burial in neighbouring regions. The corpses of those who had died at home were kept in sealed-off rooms for days as undertakers struggled to cope.“He died in my mother’s arms as I was on the telephone, trying to get help,” said Asia Marchesi, 24. “Watching him struggling to breathe was like watching somebody drown.”Her father, Siro, is one of many who died at home, a silent toll which, as with deaths in care homes, has not been recorded in the official statistics.It is thought the 64-year-old may have contracted Covid-19 on 22 February, when he visited the emergency unit of a hospital in Bergamo city for a foot infection.“He had to take an antibiotic for that but it wasn’t anything serious, after a week he was better,” his daughter said.He then travelled to the family’s second home in Liguria, but returned to Bergamo on 6 March after he started to feel unwell.“From the moment he became ill the nightmare began.” Asia Marchesi made frantic calls to helpline numbers and as she waited for a response, she could hear her father’s breathing getting worse. His GP visited and prescribed an antibiotic. Despite presenting all the symptoms and being immunosuppressed, no coronavirus test was done.He died on 13 March, and his body was kept at home for one-and-a-half days, covered with a sheet, while the family waited for a doctor to certify the death. As with many other deaths at home or in residential care, no postmortem test was done for Covid-19.Asia Marchesi struggled not to cry as she described her father. “Until the last moment, all he kept saying was: ‘Asia, stop calling the doctors, I don’t want to disturb them.’”She added: “There is some comfort that we were with him at the end, as so many people die alone in hospital, but he died such a terrible death. We felt abandoned.”With funerals banned and physical distancing in place, she, her mother and two siblings who live nearby were unable to be physically comforted by relatives and friends, amplifying their grief. “We couldn’t even … receive a hug.”Marchesi has joined NOI Denunceremo (We Will Denounce), a Facebook group for relatives of victims who are seeking justice.“People have lost their loved ones unjustly,” she said. “Even if these are difficult economic times I do not want financial compensation as it won’t bring my father back. What I want is for whoever made a mistake to take responsibility.”In normal times Milan is Italy’s business and fashion hub. The Lombardy capital started to empty out soon after the outbreak began in Codogno but it did not go into quarantine until 9 March.The only vehicles speeding through the normally clogged streets during lockdown have been ambulances, especially at night, when 33-year-old Matteo Derai joins the hundreds of volunteers responding to callouts. Eighty per cent of the calls during the peak were for suspected Covid-19.“Nobody is forcing me to do this, but above all in these moments we must be courageous,” he said. “Only when my shift is over do I realise that I haven’t slept for 24 hours.”His partner, Fosca, is a nurse on maternity leave who cares for their newborn son, Tommaso. When Derai returns home, after shuttling suspected Covid-19 patients around hospitals, he lives with the fear of bringing the virus home to his family.“Roughly eight out of 10 patients who I have seen were suspected cases of Covid-19,” said Derai, who during the day works for a watch company. “And often you have no idea what to expect when you reach their homes. When I did my job before the outbreak, I was full of adrenaline. Now I’m fear-stricken.“If before the outbreak, I tried to support people emotionally as well, now, when you are so concerned about your own safety, you let this human connection slip.”It has been common for first-responders to bring to hospitals relatives of patients already being treated for or dead from Covid-19. “We brought in patients who had already lost their loved ones to the virus,” he said. “And they are well aware that they, too, will have to face the same sort of odyssey.”One, Derai said, was a woman who had lost her husband. “She told us that what struck her most was the silence without him and that she may be heading towards the same destiny.”He does not know whether the dozens of patients he brought to hospital lived or died. His duty ends when they are admitted. “At the beginning, I was curious to know if the mothers, fathers, husbands and grandmothers I had met and spoken to while on the way to the hospital had recovered from Covid-19.“Then as I saw the number of deaths rise day after day, I stopped wondering and preferred to live with the hope that everyone made it through alive. Even if I knew it probably wasn’t true.”After almost two months under lockdown, the longest so far of any European country, Italy will begin slowly easing restrictions on 4 May. But as the health emergency subsides, the next major challenge will be the economic one.The forecast is bleak. Experts predict a crisis not seen in decades. While industry across the country will resume from Monday, most retailers will not reopen until 18 May, while bars and restaurants – the backbone of the economy of so many Italian towns – will stay closed until 1 June. Many small businesses may never reopen.Soemia Ira, 38, a street performer previously making a living in Catania, Sicily, has not worked since the lockdown began and has no idea what the future will hold.Her livelihood depends on a vibrant street culture. “I live for gatherings,” she said. “Without people around me, my work is over. I’m at risk of extinction.“I dedicated the last six years of my life to become a street performer, but Covid-19 may take it all away.”The government has allocated €3.3bn (£2.9bn) for workers at small companies, but this may not be enough. The first sign of economic upheaval came towards the end of March, when reports emerged of social unrest in Italy’s poorer south and people stealing from supermarkets after they ran out of food and money.Red Cross volunteers now deliver food to those in need but the mafia has also reportedly been exploiting the situation by distributing food parcels to the poorest districts of southern Italy.Thousands in the months ahead risk unemployment. And with summer on its way the pandemic will have a devastating impact on tourism, a crucial contributor to Italy’s economy, risking closure for hotels, bars, restaurants and tourist services.A few days into lockdown, people across Italy sang and played music from their balconies as they came together to say: “Andrà tutto bene” (Everything will be all right). But lives have changed over the last few months, and a different saying is gathering momentum: “No,” Ira said. “Everything will not be all right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c289b5915476567fe00fb9fcff95cc57818457a2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e50f58d021c4c85a957998fca66bf13","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The number of people confirmed to have had coronavirus worldwide has passed 3.5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with deaths nearing a quarter of a million. North America and European countries accounted for most of the new cases reported in recent days, but numbers were rising from smaller bases in Latin America, Africa and Russia. There are currently 3,523,121 confirmed cases of the virus, and 247,752 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far.An intelligence report by the US Department of Homeland Security, obtained by the Associated Press, claims China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is in order to stock up on the medical supplies needed to respond to it. Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page report dated 1 May. The Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, saying on Sunday that the country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.A global alliance of world leaders is expected to pledge to raise an initial $8.2bn (£6.5bn) at a virtual summit on Monday to research and equitably distribute vaccines and therapeutics to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic. It is hoped national research efforts will be streamlined so that vaccines are manufactured quickly for distribution to poorer countries, and not just for the benefit of the wealthy economies that produce them.Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said on Monday he had decided to extend the country’s national state of emergency to 31 May. Abe would consider lifting the state of emergency without waiting for its 31 May expiration if experts decided it was possible based on detailed analysis of regional infection trends, he said at the start of a meeting of the government’s coronavirus taskforce.Iceland’s secondary schools and universities began reopening on Monday, as the country began easing measures put in place seven weeks ago to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The country, with a population 364,000, has confirmed 1,799 cases of the illness and 10 deaths, but the daily number of new cases has ranged between zero and three since 23 April.The Fina world championships in Fukuoka, Japan, were initially scheduled for the summer of 2021, but will now take place from 13 May 2022 to 29 May 2022. Fina’s president, Dr Julio C Maglione, said in a statement: “At a time of unprecedented uncertainty, Fina hopes the announcement of these dates will allow for some clarity in planning for all concerned.”France said on Sunday that it would not quarantine anyone arriving from the EU, the Schengen area or Britain due to the coronavirus, as it prepares to start easing confinement measures after two months of lockdown. On Saturday, the government had said it would extend the state of emergency to contain the crisis until at least 24 July, and anyone entering France would have to remain in isolation for two weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are there in my area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

He has called critical journalists liars and “presstitutes”, and said the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) should resign. On Wednesday, he retweeted an article suggesting press freedom advocates who had raised alarm about his actions had been using cocaine.Janša, who has a Trump-like tendency to fire off inflammatory tweets and is a close ally of the far-right Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, took office after the country’s previous prime minister, Marjan Šarec, resigned, hoping for early elections. Janša was able to form a coalition with his Slovenian Democratic party and three other parties.In its first weeks, the government’s attention has been largely focused on the response to coronavirus, and Slovenia has so far managed to keep numbers of infections and deaths low. However, critics fear Janša, like his mentor Orbán, wants to use the coronavirus crisis for political advantage.He will also be able to act as an additional voice of support inside the EU for Orbán and the Polish government, who want to ensure the union does not lecture member states on democracy and rule of law. Slovenia will hold the rotating EU presidency next year.The 61-year-old Janša has made a very similar political journey to Orbán, starting out three decades ago as a pro-democracy fighter and gradually shifting further right over the years, picking up anti-migration and climate sceptic rhetoric along the way. Janša’s political campaigns have used xenophobia, Islamophobia and hate speech, said Boris Vezjak, a professor at the University of Maribor in Slovenia.Like Orbán, he has been accused of backing cronyism and corruption. In 2013 he was sentenced to two years in prison for bribery, but his conviction was annulled by the constitutional court because of a lack of direct evidence and he was released after six months in jail. He denied all accusations.Janša, who has had two brief previous spells as prime minister, is backed by a television network funded by Hungarian figures close to Orbán, and the network’s former director Aleš Hojs has been made Janša’s new interior minister.“Like Orbán, he is good at distracting from the abuse of resources with anti-Brussels and anti-migrant rhetoric,” said Florian Bieber, a regional expert at the University of Graz. “He is also very thin-skinned.”Janša has picked up on some of Trump’s talking points around the coronavirus, including calling for the resignation of the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Like Trump, he has also made vitriolic attacks on critical journalists, accusing public television of “spreading lies”. When in opposition, in 2016, he accused two female journalists of being “washed-up prostitutes”.Since taking office in March, Janša has attacked the investigative journalist Blaž Zgaga, who criticised some government measures taken over coronavirus as unlawful. An official government account retweeted a claim that the journalist was an “escaped psychiatric patient” and said he was suffering from “Covid-MarxLenin”.Zgaga said the attacks had led to a wave of hate mail and threats. “I have been under police protection before, I have been smeared before, but I have never experienced anything like this,” he said.A consortium of press freedom associations, including Reporters without Borders, wrote an an open letter to Věra Jourová, the EU commission’s vice-president for values and transparency, calling on her to take up the matter with the Slovenian government. It chronicled the series of smears on Zgaga and said “we fear for his life after supporters of the Slovenian government declared him an enemy of the state”.“No hate, no threats, no personal attacks. Contact taken with Slovenia to discuss situation,” Jourová wrote on Twitter last week. Janša does not appear to be taking the rebuke seriously. “No single figure in Slovenian history has done more to discredit the journo community than this liar,” he wrote in response.Rights activists also say there are worrying signals about the new government’s post-coronavirus agenda. Last Tuesday, parliament passed a law that removes the rights of most NGOs to take part in environmental assessments of infrastructure projects. Billed as a way to help kickstart the economy post-coronavirus, NGOs in Ljubljana, the capital, say it will allow the government to plough ahead on controversial construction projects without taking environmental concerns into consideration.A restraining factor on Janša is likely to be that he has to govern in coalition, and with an electorate that has traditionally veered centre left, this will make it harder to attempt to redraw the county’s political scene.“Janša is ready to go as far as Orbán, no doubt about it, but luckily the opposition is still strong and maybe also the coalition will not be willing to support him until the end,” said Vezjak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44e27edda18a46ad3c7f5c3597aee15307d02c76/0_207_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=024262629a6677fb63f441c321a6d36c","title":"north korean defectors sorry after false kim jong un speculation","story":"Thae Yong-ho and Ji Seong-ho both said in South Korea that leader was gravely ill or deadA former senior North Korean diplomat has apologised after saying Kim Jong-un was probably so ill he could not stand, days before he emerged on state media smoking and walking briskly at an event attended by hundreds of officials.Kim disappeared from state media for three weeks, an unusually long time, leading to concerns over the nuclear-armed state in the event of an unexpected succession.High-profile defectors from the country speculated that Kim was suffering from a grave illness or could even be dead. North Korean media on Saturday broadcast video of Kim during a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the inauguration of a fertiliser plant.One of the defectors, Thae Yong-ho, former deputy ambassador to Britain and one of two defectors elected to the South Korean parliament last month, on Monday issued an apology for his claims.“I am aware that one of the reasons why many of you voted for me as a lawmaker is with the expectations of an accurate analysis and projections on North Korean issues,” he said in a statement. “I feel the blame and heavy responsibility.““Whatever the reasons, I apologise to everyone.““I have pondered on myself for the past few days, and felt the weight of the position that I’m in,” Ji said in a statement. “As a public figure, I will behave carefully going forward.“Ji had told Reuters on Friday he had received information about Kim’s death from a source he could not disclose.South Korea’s ruling Democratic party criticised the pair for carelessness. One party member urged them to be excluded from the intelligence and defence committees, while another said the defectors contributed little to South Korean society.Ji’s party acknowledged he had made “rash, careless” remarks but criticised the ruling party for undermining the two and “instigating hatred” towards them.The blunders highlight the difficulty of getting reliable information on North Korea. The secretive country has for decades kept tight control on information, and news on the health and whereabouts of its leader are shared with only a handful of most trusted aides.Thae wrote in his memoir that when former leader Kim Jong-il died in 2011, even the foreign minister did not know until ministry staff were called to watch a state media announcement.The South Korea government, which gathers intelligence from various sources, had urged caution on speculation about Kim’s health and said it saw no sign anything serious had happened.Daily NK, a Seoul-based news outlet with sources inside North Korea, had reported in April that Kim was recovering from a cardiovascular procedure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0e95b2e4c48c1dd3cb4a3afb78c62dbbb58081/0_77_2343_1406/master/2343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a77d5f4d6e71dff3c053642283fc0e33","title":"rapid coronavirus test site data was not shared with scottish and welsh ministers","story":"Results from rapid testing sites was restricted until last week because of data disclosure rulesHealth ministers in Scotland and Wales were barred from seeing thousands of coronavirus results from rapid testing sites for weeks because of data restrictions imposed by the UK government.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) began setting up rapid testing centres across the UK to test hospital staff and key workers for Covid-19 in early April, but Scottish and Welsh ministers were given the data for the first time late last monthThe DHSC, which hired the accountancy firm Deloitte to run the programme, decided at first to only give the results to inidual patients, to the irritation of ministers in Scotland.Initially only patients in hospital could get tests in the UK. Then testing was expanded to NHS staff and care home staff. Now up to 10 million essential workers and their families who are showing symptoms of coronavirus can apply for a test via a government website.\u0026nbspThe list of essential workers is the same as the one used to allow the\u0026nbspchildren of key workers\u0026nbspto carry on going to school during the lockdown. In addition to health and social care staff, the list includes teachers, judges, some lawyers, religious staff, and journalists providing public service broadcasting.Also included are local civil servants, police, armed service personnel, fire and rescue service staff, immigration officers and prison and probation staff. Some private-sector staff also qualify including vets, those in food production, essential financial services and information technology, as well as those working in the oil, gas, electricity and water sectors.As a result, none of the positive test results detected in Scotland and Wales were included in their daily updates on Covid-19 cases in April, and could not be factored into those governments’ planning for the pandemic.The DHSC’s very narrowly drawn data disclosure policies meant those results could not be shared with the Scottish and Welsh governments, or the hospitals those staff worked for, even if it was anonymised. English hospitals reported that some test results were late, lost or given to the wrong workers.UK government ministers and health officials had described the rapid testing centres as a key part of the “five pillars” strategy to confront the pandemic, and said their output was essential in meeting Matt Hancock’s pledge on 2 April to carry out 100,000 tests per day by the end of April.When the Edinburgh test centre opened on 16 April, Lord Bethell, a UK government health minister, said it was a “national effort to boost testing capacity for coronavirus to protect the vulnerable, support our NHS, and ultimately save lives”.The DHSC said overall results from those tests were included in UK totals released by the UK government each day. However, it refused to disclose publicly how many tests it carried out at rapid testing centres in different parts of the UK.In Scotland and Wales, the UK government had opened rapid testing centres at Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Inverness airports and Cardiff City’s football stadium before they changed the data protection rules.The Glasgow and Cardiff sites started testing nearly three weeks before the rules were amended. The devolved governments were told each day how many tests had been carried out at the rapid testing centres, but not what those tests uncovered.The Scottish government said knowing how many key workers were positive was “essential in order to report meaningfully on the testing conducted at these facilities”. Officials in Edinburgh said they were told the DHSC had decided only the patient would know whether their results were negative or positive.The UK, Welsh and Scottish governments told the  they finally resolved the data protection issue in late April.In contrast, the Scottish government had been giving the UK government a full daily breakdown of all its testing programme data from March onwards, including the number of tests, the number of people tested, the results of those tests and its total testing capacity.The Scottish government said that even though rapid testing centre results are now being shared by the DHSC, the figures released by the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, every lunchtime still do not include the UK government data because they need to check it is accurate and robust.While the figures are now being used within the Scottish NHS, the data may not yet be publicly available until early May – a month after the first Scottish centre opened.A Welsh government spokesman said: “We identified issues around the storage of data from testing centres at the outset and worked with UK government and Deloitte to ensure data was retained by NHS Wales.”A DHSC spokesman confirmed there had been a delay. He said: “We have made clear from the outset we would be happy to provide this data to NHS National Services Scotland and have now done so after being provided with the necessary legal and technical assurances from Scotland.“A new digital system has now been built which will allow the fast flowing of this data to the relevant public health authorities, including in Scotland, going forwards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13e91fd72954b917cf849085cd1bd4407e82af5d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3d77871690b223bdd0288402ec24282","title":"uk workplace rules may include extensive hygiene measures","story":"Physical shields and PPE could be used to protect people, says defence secretaryEmployees could have to return to work with physical shields to separate them from colleagues, personal protective equipment (PPE) and limits on time spent close to each other, according to Ben Wallace, the defence secretary.In a round of broadcast interviews, Wallace said there was a range of measures that could be used in workplaces where maintaining a two-metre distance between colleagues is not possible.Boris Johnson is preparing to set out on Sunday how restrictions can be eased but before that, business groups and trade unions have been sent draft guidelines for how to protect people if physical distancing rules cannot be adhered to.Wallace told the BBC that supermarket shoppers are not two metres from those working at the tills but are separated by physical shields. “Potentially, shields or PPE is a way forward,” he said.Wallace also highlighted the “use of time” as another tool: “You could be closer than two metres but not for long,” he said.He also confirmed the government is sourcing more face masks but stressed they should be distributed to key workers first and argued they make a marginal difference. According to a draft plan seen by the BBC, other workplace measures including reduced hot-desking and staggered shift times.The document urges employers to minimise the number of staff using equipment and maximise home working. However, a section marked “PPE” contains only a promise that more detail would follow.The report comes after the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, suggested one-way systems for commuters could be put in place to avoid overwhelming the transport system. Shapps also floated the idea of staggered work times to avoid crushes during the morning peak and suggested the government was considering measures to encourage workers to take active transport such as cycling or walking to work.Trains, buses and transport interchanges could also be equipped with hand-sanitiser, as hand-washing remained more important than wearing face masks, he suggested.Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the issue of whether employers would be held liable even if they fulfilled their obligations was one of the “key questions we’ve asked” after the draft plans surfaced.Marshall told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We need as much specificity as possible so businesses can ensure they’ve taken all the steps they can in order to protect their people.“And as much as possible we want to see consistency across the UK, it would be very confusing and costly for businesses if we saw different nations going in very different directions. They (bosses) will want to know that they’re not going to be held liable to horrible things that may unfortunately happen if they’ve done everything in their power to keep their people safe.“Whereas by contrast, you’d want to see those employers who didn’t take adequate steps face the consequences of that so the question of legal liability is extremely important.”Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister, said the public “deserve to be levelled with” over a detailed plan for easing lockdown measures.She told BBC Breakfast: “Government need to put in a range of measures – whether that is mass community testing, contact tracing, and also those things like potentially the face coverings.”She said: “But also I think the public who have overwhelmingly stuck by these very tough lockdown rules over the last few weeks deserve to be levelled with and also want some hope for the future, so that’s why we’re urging the government to give much more detail, and face masks are one part of that.”On Monday, Johnson will tell an international conference the coronavirus vaccine is “the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes”. He will urge countries to pull together and share their expertise to beat the virus.The prime minister is co-hosting the virtual coronavirus global response international pledging conference. As well as the UK, eight other countries and organisations are also co-hosting the forum on Monday, which aims to bring in more than $8bn (£6.4bn) in funding to support the global response.Johnson is expected to say: “To win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine.”On Sunday night, the US president, Donald Trump, said he expected a vaccine to be developed before the end of the year, though experts worldwide said it may take 12-18 months.Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and director of the Wellcome Trust, told the Today programme that finding a vaccine should not be the sole focus, as treatment was also important.He said people had thought a vaccine would be available for HIV decades ago but ultimately none had been developed and treatment has proved more effective."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65b28f6d791f46f5ceaa691495da51b23dac567f/0_163_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90e6ae34951ee6a7e161f2f82575918f","title":"united nations un haiti cholera letter rights monitors","story":"Thirteen UN rights monitors have unleashed blistering criticism of the United Nations for its “deeply disappointing” failure to make amends for having brought cholera to Haiti causing the deaths of at least 10,000 people.In a letter to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, the independent monitors excoriate the world body for making “illusory” promises to the Haitian people. They note that having pledged $400m for a cholera clean-up mission, the UN has raised just $21m and spent “a pitiful” $3m.“This is a deeply disappointing showing following the loss of 10,000 lives,” the letter states.Scientific evidence has conclusively shown that cholera was imported into the country by sick Nepalese UN peacekeepers who were relocated in 2010 to Haiti to help with a devastating earthquake. The UN failed to screen the Nepalese force for the disease, which could have been done before they deployed from Nepal for less than $2,000.For six years the UN denied any involvement in the transmission of the cholera bacterium. In 2016 it issued a fudged apology, but has continued to resist accepting any legal responsibility or to pay compensation.Philip Alston, the UN monitor on extreme poverty and human rights who is lead signatory of the letter, told the  that the UN’s failings were put into clear relief by the coronavirus pandemic.“The world is rightly focused on the horrors of Covid-19 and losing thousands of people. But 10,000 people died in Haiti and there was no response,” he said.Alston, who prepared a report to the UN general assembly on Haiti’s cholera disaster in 2016, added: “What upsets me most is that the UN has still not acknowledged its responsibility for taking cholera to Haiti.”Cholera appears to have been halted in Haiti with the last case reported in January 2019. Even then, the bulk of the public health work devoted to root out the illness was carried out by local health workers and aid groups and not by the UN.In December 2016, the then UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, made an apology of sorts, but it was carefully worded to avoid any legal accountability. He said: “We did not do enough with regard to the cholera outbreak and spread in Haiti.”Alston said: “There continues to be an explicit refusal to accept any formal responsibility, let alone legal responsibility.”The independent UN monitors who signed the letter include Leilani Farha, special rapporteur on adequate housing Léo Heller, special rapporteur on water and sanitation and five members of the working group of experts on people of African descent.The lack of any compensation for the cholera disaster has had serious consequences for thousands of people in the poverty-stricken country. Many of those who died in the epidemic were the main income earners of their families, and their deaths had catastrophic implications for those left behind.Alston told the  that having studied the cholera disaster over many years he had concluded that the UN’s reprehensible conduct could only be understood by accepting that “an element of racism is involved here”.He said: “If this happened to a white community in a country with any standing globally the UN wouldn’t have done – and wouldn’t have been able to do – nothing. But this is Haiti, a country which has largely been written off.”In a statement, a UN spokesman said: “Since taking office, the Secretary-General has been strongly committed to supporting the people of Haiti and the fight against cholera. He reiterates the UN’s deep regrets for the loss of life and suffering caused by the cholera epidemic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b3eb0c345a214a126d04fcc528a547fd800e213/322_21_2002_1201/master/2002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=598e41c2ec595ef6c613b99aa654edac","title":"vote leave ai firm wins seven government contracts in 18 months","story":"Tory minister is resisting calls to sell stake in Faculty as it expands its Whitehall reachAn artificial intelligence startup that was hired to work with Dominic Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign has been awarded at least seven government contracts worth almost £1m in the space of 18 months.Faculty, which has links to senior Tory figures in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office, is rapidly expanding its reach into various corners of Whitehall and last year was tasked with finding ways to apply artificial intelligence across government.A Cabinet Office minister, Theodore Agnew, who is responsible for the government department that promotes the use of digital technology within public services, is resisting calls to sell a £90,000 shareholding in the company amid claims of a conflict of interest.On Friday it emerged that Faculty’s chief executive, Marc Warner, attended a meeting of the government’s scientific advisory group on emergencies (Sage).Cummings has for years maintained a blog documenting among other things his enthusiasm for the disruptive potential of new technologies and artificial intelligence.Faculty is run by Marc Warner, whose brother Ben Warner, a data scientist, was reportedly recruited to Downing Street last year by Cummings after running the data modelling for the Conservative party’s general election campaign. Ben Warner is a former senior employee at Faculty and is also said to have worked on Vote Leave.Ben Warner hit the headlines when the  revealed he and Cummings have been attending meetings of Sage, which provides advice to ministers on Covid-19. One Sage attendee told the  that Warner was a regular participant in meetings and “behaved as Cummings’ deputy”.Faculty is working at the heart of the government’s response to the pandemic. It has been processing large volumes of confidential UK patient information in an “unprecedented” data-mining operation alongside Palantir, a US firm founded by the libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel.Marc Warner disclosed in an article in the Times that he too attended a critical meeting of Sage in March before the lockdown was imposed. He argued that he needed to align Faculty’s work with that of the rest of government, including Sage. Faculty said he attended Sage as an observer.Faculty’s work on the coronavirus response is only the latest government project it has secured under the Conservative administration. One early contract, for £32,000, funded fellowships in 2018 to place data scientists in city governments to help solve local challenges. Faculty was at that time operating under its original name, Advanced Skills Initiative.Last year Faculty was awarded a £250,000 contract from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to run a cross-government review on the adoption of artificial intelligence, announced on the same day that the company rebranded as Faculty Science.Under the contract, Faculty worked with two government departments – the Office for Artificial Intelligence and Government Digital Service (GDS) – “to identify the most significant opportunities to introduce AI across government with the aim of increasing productivity and improving the quality of public services”.One of Faculty’s shareholders is Lord Agnew, a financier who has been a government minister since 2017. He has owned shares in the firm for the past four years. They are worth around £90,000, according to its most recent filings.In February this year it was announced that Agnew had become a minister in the Cabinet Office and Treasury and had taken ministerial responsibility for the GDS, which works with official bodies to use digital technology to improve public services.A government spokesperson said Agnew had had no role in awarding any contracts to Faculty while he had been a minister. However, Spotlight on Corruption, a watchdog group, has called on Agnew to sell his shareholding in Faculty, saying it raised questions over the government’s rules on managing conflicts of interests.The government spokesperson replied that Agnew had followed the appropriate procedures by declaring his shareholding in House of Lords register of interests and under the ministerial code of conduct.Faculty said that while the GDS approved the overall budget for technology projects, it was not involved in the tendering or approval of specific contracts by inidual departments.Last year Faculty also received two consultancy contracts worth £185,000 from GDS. In March it also secured a £125,000 contract to provide advice on bias mitigation in finance and recruitment to the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI), a government-funded board of experts who have been tasked by ministers with making recommendations about the ethical implementation of new technologies.One of the CDEI board members is Faculty’s chief commercial officer, Richard Sargeant. A Faculty spokesperson said Sargeant had recused himself from any discussions concerning the CDEI contract. A government spokesperson said Faculty was the highest-scoring bidder under a competitive tender.Faculty’s government work with Palantir on Covid-19 is based out of NHSX, the digital technology arm of the health service. This work was awarded to Faculty in March under the government’s fast-track procedures to respond to the pandemic, without any other firms being asked to bid for it.Instead of an open tender process, the Department of Health decided to extend a contract that had already been awarded to Faculty. The original contract was awarded after a competitive tender. Faculty said the extension of the contract built on its existing work with NHSX to create a new artificial intelligence laboratory.In addition, Faculty has been awarded a £264,000 contract from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to monitor the impact of the coronavirus on industry.In February 2018 it was reported that Faculty had a £600,000 contract from the Home Office to track terrorist videos online.Holly Searle, Faculty’s head of PR and communications, said: “Faculty has strong governance procedures in place to guard against conflicts of interest when competing for new work. All of its contracts with the government are won through the proper processes and in line with procurement rules.”The Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the , is the sole investor in GMG Ventures, which is a minority shareholder in Faculty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5525f95a27455c8bae9e0e9277259f3b9742dba4/0_260_7819_4693/master/7819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc4ea66d4d265be0c1122f3bd434e212","title":"were ready if we are needed east london mosque opens covid 19 morgue","story":"Mosque has transformed railway arches into mortuary in just over two weeksThe final few snagging jobs were still in progress at the end of a lightning conversion of railway arches into an emergency morgue as the first bodies arrived.A smell of fresh paint hung in the air a few toolboxes lay on the concrete floor. The nearby East London Mosque had transformed the space, normally used to store vehicles, into a Covid-19 mortuary in a little over a fortnight.Two coffins were unloaded from a van and wheeled on trolleys through to a refrigerated space at the back of the premises, containing metal racks capable of holding 24 corpses. There was room for dozens more if needed.The coffins contained the remains of two men of Moroccan descent who had died of coronavirus at St Mary’s hospital in Paddington. They had been brought to Whitechapel through the capital’s unusually quiet streets by Haji Taslim Funerals, London’s oldest Muslim funeral service, which is based at the mosque.In the spotless refrigerated room, the coffin lids were carefully removed to allow morgue attendants to perform a dry purification ritual, tayammum, using a special sandstone, on the shrouded bodies. The morgue has a section in which bodies can be washed with water in a more common ritual called ghusl, but the risk of contamination from Covid means tayammum is now being performed more often.In normal times, Muslims bury the dead as quickly as possible. But the number of deaths in the past few weeks has come close to overwhelming funeral services and cemeteries. Delays of up to 10 days have added a fresh layer of distress to grieving families.Funds for the emergency morgue had been raised from the community, he said. The bulk of £80,000 given in donations in less than three weeks had been spent on the conversion of the railway arches, and the rest on hiring extra grave diggers, paying volunteers’ expenses, transportation and personal protective equipment (PPE).The mosque – one of the biggest in Europe with a capacity of 7,000, serving the UK’s largest Muslim community – has its own mortuary, which can hold four bodies, and facilities for washing the dead. But the building has been closed since 19 March, a few days before the government ordered a general lockdown.The holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset, is usually the busiest time of year for the mosque, with nightly iftars and prayer sessions. Now it is deserted.“Covid-19 has put fear in the hearts resulting in social isolation and lockdown. Businesses have closed down and people have lost their livelihood in their millions and are suffering from hunger and a loss of wealth. And of course, many have lost their lives. This is clearly a test from Allah,” said Muhammad Habibur Rahman, the mosque’s chairman, in a Ramadan message.Under the railway arches, Jaman was hoping and praying that the death toll from Covid-19 had passed its peak. “But we’re ready if we are needed,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19756e8905abf58df593c4704497019d0eed5bd4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfd6c66b202570a9d4304db2c706d71c","title":"all dressed up one streets response to corona chic in pictures","story":"With pyjamas and tracksuits becoming the lockdown look, the photographer Robin Sinha invited residents of his home street in Walthamstow to put on their Sunday best and imagine they had a special occasion to attend.

Infections have almost doubled in the last week to 2,500. Over 2000 cases are active infections, with 87 people dying from the virus and 400 having now recovered.Movement is permitted providing face masks are worn. Several businesses including restaurants, viewing centres and places of worship will remain closed. Gatherings of more than 20 remain banned. Yet the easing of restrictions has drawn sharp criticism.This weekend, the head of the Nigerian Medical Association said, “the easing of the lockdown even in phases is very premature,” and could portend a “frightening scenario.”Many African countries including Nigeria, swiftly adopted restrictive lockdowns, travel bans and other measures to curb Covid-19, far earlier than in many other parts of the world. Yet a worsening economy, and stretched security services, have diminished the limit of Nigeria’s ability to withstand the effects that the lockdown has wrought.The government has provided support to only a small fraction of millions most affected.During the lockdown, the number of testing laboratories have significantly improved to 18 from just 4 two months ago. But low levels of testing in Nigeria have only slowly risen, with 17,500 tests administered in total.Heightening fears further are hundreds of additional deaths in Kano, Nigeria’s second largest city, which have now been confirmed as linked to Covid-19.Local media reports of residents fleeing Kano despite a ban on inter-state travel have heightened concerns that a potential epicentre is not secure.A two-week lockdown was imposed on Kano by President Buhari but the state governor has since declared that the measures would be suspended on Monday and Thursday this week to help residents during Ramadan.The European Union pledged €1 billion euros ($1.09 billion) on Monday for the global search for vaccines and treatment for the novel coronavirus, the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a pledging conference.Norway pledged to give $1 billion to support the distribution worldwide of any vaccine developed against COVID-19 as well as for vaccines against other diseases, Prime Minister Erna Solberg said on Monday.England reported 204 new coronavirus hospital deaths, the lowest daily increase since 30 March.The new hospital deaths bring the total figure of confirmed deaths in hospitals to 21,384.Scotland reported five new coronavirus deaths, taking total to 1,576. She said that there are 99 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms in Scotland, no change from yesterday.Wales reported 14 new coronavirus deaths, taking total to 997.Downing Street has published the names of the more than 50 scientists who sit on its Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies to discuss coronavirus, after criticism of the secrecy surrounding the group and the ’s revelation that the No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings had attended meetings of the group.The list of names was made available on the government’s website, showing that around half of the experts come from universities and another half are made up of government chief scientific advisers, public health officials or NHS senior staff.Cummings is not listed as a member even though he attended meetings and made interjections, according to those present.The scientists include university professors such as Wendy Barclay, Ian Boyd, John Edmunds, Sir Jeremy Farrar, Neil Ferguson, Julia Gog, Peter Horby, Dame Theresa Marteau, Graham Medley, Andrew Morris, Cath Noakes, Michael Parker, Venki Ramakrishnan, Andrew Rambaut, Brooke Rogers, James Rubin, Calum Semple, Sir David Spieglhalter, Russell Viner, Mark Woolhouse and Lucy Yardley.Two participants refused to be named. Membership lists of several other advisory groups were also published.Migrant labourers in Indian cities whose incomes have plummeted as a result of anti-coronavirus lockdown measures have been told that they will have to pay to board special trains taking them back to their homes in the countryside.The decision has prompted derision in India, where most labourers live off what they earn in a day and have been surviving on state handouts.“At first I thought it was a joke,” said Badal Raj, a carpenter from Patna who lives in a shelter in Delhi. “We have to pay? My last few rupees went on recharging my phone so I could speak to my children. Where am I going to get the money for the fare?”Since the lockdown was imposed on 25 March, an estimated 10 million labourers have been trapped in the company of strangers in cities across India, with no work or income and a long way from the comfort of home and family.With public transport shut down, many labourers walked hundreds of miles to their homes in a massive reverse migration. Those who remained have been sequestered in government shelters.Mass deaths in a northern Nigerian state were caused by coronavirus, authorities said after a preliminary investigation into the phenomenon. Gravediggers in the state of Kano have reported burying dozens of corpses per day, in what the authorities had called “mysterious deaths”. But a local Covid-19 team, after carrying out door-to-door investigations and interviewing bereaved relatives, said coronavirus was most likely to blame. “With the preliminary report, most of the deaths recorded of recent, and tests carried out, indicated that coronavirus is the cause,” the team leader, Nasiru Sani Gwarzo, told reporters.The final report will be published in the coming days, but residents needed to face the “serious issue at hand”, he said. He warned the pandemic had “scaled to the level of community transmission”. Kano, with around 12 million people, is the second most populous state in Nigeria. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control on Friday said the number of recorded infections across Kano rose to 219, up from 77 at the start of the week. Kano has in recent days seen a spate of high-profile deaths including academics, bureaucrats, businessmen and traditional leaders. The state has the capacity to carry out just 88 tests per day, which should rise to 300 this week. Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, with a headcount of around 200 million people, has 2,500 recorded cases of coronavirus and 87 deaths, according to official figures. A lockdown on Nigeria’s largest city Lagos and the capital Abuja was to ease on Monday. Restrictions in Kano remain in force, although the authorities eased the measures for six hours on Monday to enable people to shop and replenish dwindling supplies. Hundreds of South African health workers were given a century-old tuberculosis vaccine on Monday in a trial to see whether the venerable formula can protect against coronavirus. Devised at France’s legendary Pasteur Institute 100 years ago, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is one of the world’s oldest and most trusted immunisations. “We vaccinated the first participant this morning,” Duncan McDonald, head of business development and marketing at a clinical research organisation called TASK, told AFP. Trials started at Tygerberg hospital in Cape Town, where BCG booster shots were administered to 250 health care workers, while another 250 received a dummy formula, or placebo. “There are observations that this BCG vaccine does something to the immune system that we don’t really understand,” TASK founder professor, Andreas Diacon, said. Children immunised with BCG tend to suffer less from respiratory illnesses, including asthma, he said. “It makes the immune system cope better with respiratory retract infections,” said Diacon. “No one actually really understands why it works.”Diacon and his team want to determine whether BCG could have an effect on coronavirus by reducing the risk of infection or easing symptoms. “If you can reduce the (Covid-19) symptoms just a little, you will probably get people to survive this better or not even have to go to hospital or not even becoming ill,” said Diacon. The plan is to ramp up the trials to up to 3,000 health care workers in Cape Town. Participants will be observed for at least a year. Similar BCG clinical trials are being conducted in the Netherlands, Australia and France.Millions of people were allowed to return to work in Italy on Monday as Europe’s longest lockdown started to ease.Italy, the first European country hit by the pandemic and a nation with one of the world’s highest death tolls, started stirring after its two-month shutdown. In all, 4.4 million Italians were able to return to work, and restrictions on movement eased.Traffic in downtown Rome picked up, construction sites and manufacturing operations resumed, parks reopened and flower vendors returned to the Campo dei Fiori market for the first time since 11 March.Its something that brings happiness and joy, and people have been missing that these days, vendor Stefano Fulvi said. He doesn’t expect to break even anytime soon, but you have to take the risk at some point, he said.Mourners in the country are able to attend funerals, but services are limited to 15 people and there is still no word on when Masses will resume.Restaurants scrubbed their floors in preparation for take-out service, but sit-down service is several weeks away.Southern Italy braced for the return of students and workers who were trapped in the hard-hit north when the lockdown took effect. Some regional governors said they would require anyone arriving home to go into quarantine for two weeks.Its a new page that we must write together, with trust and responsibility, remier Giuseppe Conte said in a message to Italians.The Pulitzer prizes in journalism and the arts will be announced on Monday after being postponed by the coronavirus outbreak.The initial Pulitzer ceremony, which was scheduled for 20 April, was pushed back to give Pulitzer board members who were busy covering the pandemic more time to evaluate the finalists.The awards luncheon that is traditionally held at Columbia University in May will be postponed as well. Details of a fall celebration will be announced at a later date, the Pulitzer board said.The Pulitzer prizes in journalism were first awarded in 1917 and are considered the field’s most prestigious honour in the US.Germany, which is part of Europe’s open-border Schengen area, will extend its border checks until 15 May, a spokesman for the interior ministry has said. The measure is in line with the European commission, he added. “Of course, we are guided by the European spirit not to act unilaterally or in an uncoordinated way.”  Numerous Schengen countries have imposed emergency border checks in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus.A street artist called Msale has created giant murals bringing public health messages directly to the overcrowded Mathare slum in Nairobi, Kenya.With half a million people living in such “a squeezed area” social distancing is quite impossible to achieve, says Msale, so he is providing information for people on how to keep safe in the “simplest, clearest” way he knows.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands rose by 199 on Monday to 40,770, with 26 new deaths, health authorities said.

The government has announced a £14m fund to help zoos and aquariums look after their animals in the face of pandemic closures. Zoos and aquariums have lost visitor income having been forced to shut due in the lockdown, but still face the costs of looking after the animals in their care. The government said the funding would help zoos cover costs relating to keeping the animals and ensuring welfare standards are upheld – helping pay for things such as feed, heating and security. The environment department (Defra) also said it would continue to work with some of the largest zoos to discuss additional concerns about funding in the longer term. The chief medical officer for Wales, Frank Atherton, is going to “formalise his advice” to the Welsh government on whether people should wear non-clinical face coverings, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, said. Drakeford explained:What we are talking about are not masks of the sort that are worn in hospital.We’re not going to embark on a course of action where members of the public end up competing with the health service for the use of masks which are needed in a clinical setting, and for which there isn’t evidence for use in the community.What we are talking about are non-clinical face coverings, that’s the phrase the Scottish government has used in its guidance.Thanks to those following the ’s live feed.

Speaking at the “independent Sage” (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] meeting (see 9.29am) chaired by Sir David King, Michie said:People were very surprised at how adherent the population has been and a lot of that is down to collective solidarity as people have been rising to the challenge. Going forwards, in terms of lifting lockdown, it’s going to to be a very different situation.A lot of thought has to be given to how this will be managed. If it’s not handled well, it risks potential isions between groups.She added that if changes to the rules were seen as unjust and unfair, they could “lead to resentment and anger and people being alienated from the collective and what’s being asked of them.”Michie, who is also a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on behaviour, which feeds into the official government Sage, added that lockdown has already hit the disadvantaged hardest and that the way it was lifted risked driving inequality further.She told the meeting that it was crucial people from across society had financial security, that messaging was specific to different groups of society, and that more effort should be put into bottom-up community-level approaches to emerging from the lockdown.“Communities have been very impressive in how they’ve come together and this needs to be kept going,” she said. “Communities need to be mobilised for the longer term.”The government has now published a list of the experts who have participated in meetings of Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, as well as other expert groups that have been giving advice to the government on coronavirus. The details are here.Sage does not have a fixed membership. Different experts are invited to attend depending on what topic is being discussed. The government has named 50 members, who it says “have provided input as experts at one or more meetings”. It says two other participants asked not to be named.But the list does not include the names of non-expert government officials who have also attended. Downing Street was furious when the  reported recently that Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, has attended and participated in meetings. Cummings is a history graduate, not a scientist, and although some Sage members did not object to his participation, others claimed it was not appropriate.The daily Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished. Here are the key points.We view the fact that the Nightingales have not has to be used in a significant way as something that is positive.Asked if they had been a waste of money, he said: “Absolutely not.”We are at a critical moment in the fight against this virus and it it going to be crucial that we get the advice to the public right. If it means taking some extra time to do that, then that’s what we will do. I don’t think I can pre-empt the review. But if we do ease the social distancing measures in any way, it is likely to be a gradual process.The British public have sacrificed an enormous amount to fight this virus, to protect the NHS and to save lives. We are at a critical point and the worst thing that we could do is lift the measures too soon and risk a second peak which overwhelms the NHS.There has been no change to the two-metre rule. We continue to advise that people should remain two metres apart from each other. That has not changed.The spokesman said that Wallace had been “reflecting the existing advice, which says that people should remain two metres apart wherever possible”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4244115.1588526844!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plan b for leaving cert exams under active consideration","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA spokesman for the Department of Education said the Government was still planning to proceed with Leaving Cert exams on July 29th, subject to public health advice.A contingency plan for awarding grades to Leaving Certificate students in the event that summer exams are cancelled is being actively examined by senior officials, according to well-placed sources.It is understood that detailed planning for how a “plan B” could work has been stepped up in recent times with a focus on what role teachers might play in determining students’ grades in the absence of an exam.A broad outline of the plans is likely to be discussed with education stakeholders later this week.However, a spokesman for the Department of Education said the Government was still planning to proceed with Leaving Cert exams on July 29th, subject to public health advice.“Planning for the Leaving Cert is still being discussed, including through the advisory group set up by the department involving education stakeholders. It is still hoped to bring just Leaving Cert students back in July, subject to adequate planning and public health advice,” the spokesman said.The lack of a reference to the Leaving Cert exams in the Government’s roadmap for reopening society published on Friday prompted fresh uncertainty at the weekend over whether they would go ahead .A department spokesman said this roadmap was a general guide rather than a detailed plan and no significance should be read into the fact that the exams were not referenced.Thomas Byrne TD, the party’s education spokesman, said the omission of the Leaving Cert in the Government’s roadmap was a “huge oversight” and added to the “already heightened anxiety among Leaving Cert students”.“I believe the Government cannot continue to adopt this wait-and-see approach with the Leaving Cert. It is becoming clearer with every week that passes that it is simply not tenable for it to proceed,” he said.Mr Byrne said he had discussed alternatives with some universities and with Minister for Education Joe McHugh, adding: “They do exist and we must now switch our focus to them. The current situation is unacceptable and unfair and is causing untold psychological damage to these students.”On Sunday, Labour’s education spokesman Aodhán Ó Ríordáin criticised Fianna Fáil’s “knee-jerk” stance on calling for the cancellation of the Leaving Cert without providing viable alternatives.“I have called on the Minister to outline a plan B, but what I am certain on is that predictive grading is not the right solution, as it would benefit the better-off,” he said.He said such an alternative would disadvantage less well-off students who were already struggling with the digital ide and lack of resources.Entry mechanism“Anyone out calling for the cancellation of the Leaving Cert should be putting forward a credible alternative entry mechanism for third-level places. Such calls simply cause more mental stress and anguish for students, and add to the growing uncertainty about the Leaving Cert,” Mr Ó Ríordáin said.“We are open to all alternatives that will protect the health and mental health of students, and will uphold the integrity of the exams process but playing to the gallery just adds further uncertainty.”Mr McHugh has previously stated that using predicted or expected grades for students would be unfair as there was “too much inherent bias” in a system where teachers’ graded their own students.He has also pointed out that students who miss out on courses by a small margin would feel especially aggrieved.It is understood that any alternative may not be termed predictive or expected grades, but could still involve grades being applied to students.For example, the State Examinations Commission operates a system called “assessed grades” in cases where some or all of a student’s work in not available for marking due to “unique, unforeseen and exceptional” circumstances.The process involves requesting an estimate from the student’s school on the likely result the student would have received based on their prior coursework and their performance relative to other students.A total of 148 students were awarded these assessed grades last year. The equivalent figure for 2018 was 116 students, with 116 in 2017 and 159 in 2016.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Internationally, the target adoption rates for tracker apps has been estimated at up to 60 per cent of the population, but Mr Harris says a US app similar to the one being developed by the HSE needs at least a 25 per cent uptake in order to have a significant impact on the rate of infection.“The fact is that for contact tracing operations, every additional contact that the app can identify will enhance our existing contact tracing processes. The more people that use the app, the more effective it will be.”The model Ireland is using for its contact tracing app will be “less intrusive” than the types being developed in other countries, according to HSE chief executive Paul Reid, speaking on Sunday.The model, similar to the approach being followed in Germany, which retains data on the mobile phone rather than being centrally collected, will “mitigate” any data protection concerns, he said.The HSE would engage with the Data Protection Commissioner on privacy aspects and was aiming to have the app ready by the end of May.Mr Reid said the app would work on Bluetooth technology and users would have the option of providing details of their phone number.The HSE is continuing to work with Apple and Google to ensure these companies can provide the support required for the plan, he added.The app will work with a smartphone that is generally less than five years old.In some countries that have already developed apps, the take-up has been disappointing, but the technology is seen as a useful supplement to manual tracing of contacts of people who become infected. The Irish team developing the app is working closely with EU counterparts and the national health service in the UK to make sure the technology can be used across borders, according to the Minister.The app is to undergo extensive testing and trialling over the coming weeks, Mr Harris said in a briefing note on the project. The focus of contact tracing services is on the proximity between two app users within critical windows of time but location data from the app is “not of interest” to the HSE, he said.Use of the app will be limited to people aged 16 years or over as this is the digital age of consent.While the app will not record or collect exact location information, users would be given the option of volunteering their “general locality”, according to Mr Harris.As part of testing procedures, up to 2,000 volunteers will install and use the app for a period of time.In relation to the cross-border use of the app, Mr Harris said inter-operability between EU member states and use of the app across the Border “presents specific challenges which have yet to be addressed”.“The specific challenge of North-South travel in Ireland and across the Irish Sea has been highlighted in EU meetings convened to discuss eHealth and the app.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243086.1588356643!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus the reopening ireland plan in detail","story":"The current restrictions on social and economic life will be maintained for a further fortnight, and will be eased in stages from May 18th, the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has announced this evening.“We need two more weeks,” Mr Varadkar said to effectively control the spread of the virus, warning that opening up the lockdown now could result in the country going “back to square one”.He announced two minor changes to the current restrictions - the 2km limit will be extended to 5km and over 70s will now be told that they can leave their homes but only if they avoid all contact with other people. Otherwise all restrictions will remain in place.Mr Varadkar said that on May 18th, should progress in containing the virus continue in the intervening two weeks, then the restrictions will be eased in a series of five stages, three weeks apart. “Our plan is to re-open the country in a slow, staged, phased way,” Mr Varadkar said.On May 18th, some retail outlets such as garden centres and DIY centres will be allowed open, some outdoor sports will be allowed and small groups of family and friends will be permitted to meet in the open. Construction and outdoor work will restart.In later phases, other businesses will be allowed reopen. Schools and colleges will reopen in September and October at the beginning of the next academic year. Cafes and restaurants will reopen on June 29th and pubs will reopen on August 10th.However, Mr Varadkar warned that the easing of the restrictions will depend on there being no “second wave” of the virus which could overwhelm health services.“Unfortunately the risk of a second wave of the virus is ever present,” he said. “So we can only move from one phase to the next if the virus stays under control between each phase. And there is a risk that we’d have to go back a phase if that happens.“In any scenario, at least until we have a vaccine or effective treatment, there will be a long-term need for physical distancing, good hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, regular cleaning and for people to stay at home and isolate if they are sick.”Micheál Martin said he agreed with the cautious advice of the public health officials but called for clarity about the leaving certificate.Mary Lou McDonald said that it was “essential” to have a roadmap for the reopening of Ireland, and said that the testing capacity needed to be improved to allow for the lockdown to be lifted.In a televised address on Friday, Mr Varadkar said thousands of lives have been saved “because of the sacrifices and choice you have made”.“When we come through this, we will come together as a nation and grieve for everyone who has died over the course of this emergency,” he said.But he warned that the phases of reopening the country may have to be reversed back a step, if the rate of the infection increases significantly as the lockdown is eased.“We need two more weeks of tight restrictions,” Mr Varadkar said, so the virus does not have a chance to make a “comeback”.The curve has been flattened but “we have not yet won this fight”, he said.“I know for me the worst part has been the daily text message I receive at around 5 o’clock every evening of the number of deaths, and number of new cases,” the Taoiseach said. “I yearn for the day it stops.”The Full PlanTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that Ireland will begin re-opening from May 18th under a roadmap which contains five phases.The first phase begins on May 18thIn this early stage, up to four people not of the same household will be able to meet outdoors while maintaining strict social distancing. Funerals will still be a maximum of ten people. Outdoor workers in construction can return including gardeners and those working on allotments. But remote working will remain in place for the vast majority of businesses. Garden centres and hardware stores can reopen as well as opticians, bike repairs and phone repairs.Electrical outlets may open\u0026nbspTennis courts and golf courses can reopen but social distancing will apply. Outdoor public amenities and tourism sites may open. A maximum of four people can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities. Schools and college buildings will be opened to allow teachers to organise remote learning.The second phase begins on June 8thIn this phase, people will now be permitted to travel up to 20km but will be advised to avoid all unnecessary journeys. Over 70s will be allowed to shop at specific hours. Visits to homes of over 70s will be permitted by no more than a few people for a short period of time and they must wear gloves, face coverings, maintaining strict 2m social distancing.For everyone else, up to four people may visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining strict social distancing. In terms of funerals, slightly larger numbers of people can be in attendance at funerals but they will still be restricted to immediate family and close friends.There will be a “phased return” of other workers who can maintain a distance from others of two metres at all times.\u0026nbspBusinesses that can maintain remote working will be asked to do so. Small retail outlets, with a small number of staff, and open marts could also\u0026nbspreopen.Libraries can open with limited numbers. People can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities where there is a small group team but this does not include matches.The third phase begins on June 29thTravel restrictions will remain at 20km. Cafes and restaurants that can adhere to social distancing guidelines will reopen. Creches will be reopened but only for the children of essential workers. Hospital and prison visits may resume but consideration will have to be given to the availability of PPE in each unit.Businesses will be asked to continue with remote working where possible but organisations where employees have a low level of daily interaction may return. There will be a phased reopening of non-essential retail outlets on the basis of restriction on the number of staff and customers per square metre so that social distancing can be maintained. This will be limited to retail outlets with street-level entrance and exit i.e. which are not in enclosed shopping centres due to higher risk.Playgrounds will be reopened where social distancing and hygiene can be maintained. Some “behind closed doors” sporting activities will be permitted. Public transport will remain restricted. The Government will consider implementing travel restrictions on numbers travelling to and in major urban centres.The fourth phase begins on July 20thIn this phase, people can now travel outside their region. A slightly larger number of people (more than four, but the exact number has not yet been specified)\u0026nbspmay visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining social distancing. Small social gatherings by family and close friends will be limited to a maximum number of attendees for a limited period of time where social distancing can be maintained. The same will apply to other social gatherings outside of family and friends.Creches for all other workers will reopen but only for one a day a week to start with. Businesses will be asked to stagger work hours but Government will ask that remote working will continue. Hairdressers and barbers may reopen as well as museums, galleries, religious places of worship. Hotels and hostels will reopen on limited occupancy. Hotel bars will remain closed. Caravan and holiday parks may reopen. Restrictions on the numbers allowed to travel into urban centres will be decreased on public transport.The last phase begins on August 10thPubs, bars, nightclubs and casinos will reopen where social distancing and cleaning can be complied with. Festivals and other cultural gatherings may be held but with restricted numbers. Large weddings will still be restricted due to risk, as will other large gatherings. Normal visiting will resume in hospitals.A phased return to normal work will start around this time. Shopping centres will reopen as well as theatres and cinemas that can maintain social distancing. Close physical contact sports like rugby, boxing and wrestling will be permitted. Gyms can reopen where there is regular and effective cleaning.Sports spectatorship which involves mass gatherings will be permitted, but only in accordance with both indoor and outdoor number restrictions. Indoor recreational venues like roller skating, bowling alleys and bingo halls may open where numbers can be limited. High-risk organisations which cannot maintain social distancing will be asked to implement plans for how they can eventually return to full complement. Some time after this period, schools will reopen.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243943.1588527583!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus transplant for me means that i could get back to normal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSally Nagle, from Montenotte, Co Cork,  was  to receive a kidney transplant next month. Sally Nagle\u0026nbspfrom Co Cork, was due to receive a kidney transplant from her aunt this month but because of coronavirus, the surgery has been suspended until further notice.Ms Nagle (28), who is undergoing dialysis treatment three times a week at Cork University Hospital, was informed of the decision in recent weeks.“It was a little bit of a shock even though I can understand the reasoning why. It’s just not knowing now when it might happen because they said it was suspended until further notice,” she said.“I’m trying to stay positive because I know it will still come. It’s just the unknown – will it be weeks, months?”Kidney, lung and pancreas transplants have all been paused “for patient safety”, the HSE has said.Organ Donation Transplant Ireland said the national kidney transplant service at Beaumont Hospital advised that “during this period of uncertainty and with careful consideration of the risks and benefits, they have paused kidney transplant activity, but this is under continuing review”.“Donations are being actively considered where possible,” it said.There are generally about 150-180 kidney transplants carried out every year.Bone disorderMs Nagle suffers from a rare bone disorder Ideopathic Multicentric Osteolysis and, as a result, suffered kidney failure aged 14. She received her first kidney transplant in 2008, which lasted 11 years and has been on dialysis since last July.“It’s a rare condition and I’m the only case known in Britain and Ireland,” she said. “The bones in my hands and feet, mainly when I was younger, they deteriorated and formed a hard tissue instead of the bone.“I can walk, but wouldn’t be able to walk very long distances or play contact sports that are more prone to bone breakages.”Ms Nagle, who has been working in childcare and heavily involved in voluntary work over recent years, hopes to pursue a career in event management following the transplant.“Transplant for me means that I could get back to normal, obviously not at the moment with the crisis, but I’d be able to look at maybe going back to work and things that I wouldn’t really have the energy for at the moment,” she said.“With life donation, it’s two people involved and the timing has to be right for both . . . Trying to stay healthy is obviously always a worry, especially when I’m on dialysis and, overall, I’m keeping well.“But there’s nothing to say that if something was to happen, I could get something that will set us back so definitely worries do come with it but overall I’m trying to stay positive.”Mark Murphy, chief executive of the Irish Kidney Association, said kidney transplants stopped in early March.“Everything has come to a complete halt,” he said.”Patients are in this limbo because they don’t know when it might happen, they haven’t been given any new dates.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe The misunderstood term “next of kin” should cease being used in a health and social care setting, especially in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, according to a patient support group.Sage Advocacy, a support and advocacy service for vulnerable adults, older people and healthcare patients, said people should be encouraged to designate who they want as emergency and healthcare contacts, but that the misunderstood term next of kin, should not be used.Many people believe that being nominated as a “next of kin” confers an increased role for that person in terms of healthcare decisions, or even a patient’s assets, whereas really all it means is that the person is a point of contact, said Mervyn Taylor, executive director of Sage.He said the group sometimes sees cases with families where there are isions, or tensions, that some parties try to be declared next of kin, because of the false belief that it confers additional powers. He said the misunderstandings associated with the term can also be shared by healthcare professionals.Mr Taylor encouraged people, particularly those who are vulnerable, to designate an emergency contact, and also to inform healthcare staff who they would like information about their condition to be shared with. Often these are the same people, but sometimes they are not.“During this national public health emergency it is important that the care of patients is not compromised, or the time of healthcare staff wasted, by unnecessary disputes about ‘next of kin’.“Most of these disputes arise because there is a widespread belief that being a next of kin confers decision making authority with regard to healthcare decisions, or control of finances, in the event that a person loses the capacity to make decisions for themselves,” he said.However, the phrase has no legal standing and is simply someone to be contacted in an emergency. Continued use of the term is giving rise to concerns about safeguarding of vulnerable adults, often linked to isions within families, he said.A recent poll commissioned by Sage found that 57 per cent of respondents wrongly understood that if they lacked decision-making capacity, a ‘next of kin’ could make healthcare decisions for them. Almost a third believed a next of kin was entitled to access a person’s bank account and assets.He said the HSE had a very good consent policy which makes clear what the role of a patient’s doctors and a patient’s family are, in the context of making medical decisions. However, there are healthcare professionals that believe that the phrase next of kin confers powers to the nominated person, when in fact that is not the case."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Q\u0026ampA: Coronavirus measures will be eased in stages from May 18th, but there will be two changes before thenMisunderstanding over phrase which has no legal standing and is an emergency contactCavan has highest incidence of coronavirus, followed by Dublin and MonaghanMental Health Commission say some services are still waiting to hear about testingDeputy leader Catherine Martin is understood to have opposed talksMan (50s) received head injuries during incident at apartment complex on SaturdaySlightly larger attendance at funerals scheduled from June 8th with churches to reopen on July 20thHSE expects many more outbreaks in long-term residential settingsProf Sam McConkey says jobless levels are a \u0026lsquotragedy\u0026rsquo when key roles need to be filledOscar Little brings Capuchin Day Centre care packages to families in needHSE to play catch-up and treat thousands of patients with other conditionsOfficials looking at how to award grades if summer exams do not happenMore than half of young people who worked before pandemic now claiming supportKidney, lung and pancreas transplants have all been \u0026lsquopaused\u0026rsquo due to coronavirusIf you have issues with retailers or providers, there are organisations that can helpData will be held on phone, not centrally, to \u0027mitigate\u0027 data protection concerns \u0026ndash HSEGreen Party must secure a two-thirds majority if it is to enter government\u0026lsquoYour bridal whites become the grey of scrubsThe dress a gown and boots, the veil a visor\u0026rsquoHSE says it will be able to test 100,000 a week by mid-MayEarly-morning shoppers making \u0026lsquosocial distancing externally more challenging\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4244119.1588526849!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"queues derail lidl sale of trampolines and swingsets","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLidl: ‘We apologise to all customers who are left disappointed by this decision.’ Lidl has announced it will be cancelling the sale of four outdoor children’s garden products because of the rising number of people queuing outside shops in recent days.Trampolines, garden slides, swingsets and children’s kitchen sets were due to go on sale nationwide from Monday.

Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGettyThe British government has been accused of being “petty”, “provocative” and “unhelpful” after it rejected a request for the European Union to have a permanent office in Belfast. British cabinet office Minister Michael Gove responded to the North’s four pro-Remain parties – Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Alliance and the Greens – to say that an office was unnecessary.Mr Gove said it would facilitate, where necessary, ad hoc visits by EU officials to Northern Ireland but it did not accept any permanent EU presence was required in Northern Ireland.The four parties wrote to the British prime minister Boris Johnson last month urging that an EU office be re-established. The EU also made a request for an office in Belfast.The previously permanent European Commission office closed at the end of January when the UK quit the EU.There was an expectation at the time that some form of EU presence would be created later to assist continuing EU-UK business, but Mr Gove, responding on behalf of Mr Johnson, appears to have closed down that possibility.The current stance of the British government appears in direct contrast to its position in February last year when it said it not only supported having an EU office in Belfast but in London, Edinburgh and Cardiff as well.Just over a week ago Mr Gove told British MPs there was no need for a “mini embassy” in Belfast.In the 2016 referendum, 56 per cent of the electorate in Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU.EU fundingNotwithstanding the negative response, the Irish Government appears not to have given up hope that an office might yet be created. Previous figures from the European Commission office in Belfast show that going back to 1989 the EU supported the peace process, agriculture, fisheries, jobs and much more to the tune of more than €13 billion. It also plans to continue providing peace funding in the North.“We would see no issue in terms of the Good Friday agreement in having an EU office in Northern Ireland, not least given ongoing EU support for the peace process,” said a Department of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman on Sunday.“The Irish Government hopes this matter can be accommodated in a way that satisfies both sides’ needs and sensitivities,” she added.The Sinn Féin MP for North Belfast John Finucane said Mr Gove’s “mini embassy” comments were “provocative and deeply unhelpful at a crucial period in Brexit negotiations”.“The ongoing opposition by the British government to a European Union office in the North is in bad faith,” he said.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the British government response was “petty” but “unsurprising”.Alliance leader Naomi Long also described the decision as “petty”.“This gamesmanship from the UK government is reflective of their wider approach of not taking preparations for the implementation of the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol seriously,” she said. The DUP and Ulster Unionist Party, however, supported the British government’s position. In a brief statement, a DUP spokesman said, “We agree with UK government policy.”The Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said there was no need for a permanent office in Belfast“The idea of EU ‘perm reps’ with extra jurisdiction powers like the EU had in the Balkans is simply not acceptable in the UK – and it is inconceivable that any EU country would accept that on their sovereign territory,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The Greens, who won 12 seats in the February election, are seen as crucial in the formation of the next government. There was a flurry of online criticism overnight of the parliamentary party’s decision to enter talks, but senior party sources said the response had been mixed and that it was too early to take the pulse of the organisation on the coalition question.The Greens’ constitution, however, requires a two-thirds majority in a vote of the members to enter coalition.It is expected there will be a series of debates broadcast online if a programme for government is concluded, followed by a postal ballot, though the arrangements have yet to be made.Greens sources stressed the “grassroots up” nature of the party and said that the decision of the parliamentary party to enter talks – and by extension to enter government if the programme for government was acceptable – would not necessarily be followed by the membership.However, one senior figure conceded that if any deal was rejected by the members, it would amount to a vote of no confidence in the leadership of the party.

Photograph: Jagadeesh NvEPAGlobal coronavirus cases surpassed 3.5 million on Monday and deaths neared a quarter of a million.North America and European countries, where growth rates are easing, still accounted for most of the new infections reported in recent days.But case numbers were rising from smaller bases in Latin America, Africa and Russia, and experts expressed concern that the overall data falls well short of the true impact of the pandemic.Globally, there were 74,779 new cases over the past 24 hours, according to the Reuters tally that is based on official government data, taking total cases to about 3.52 million.That compares with about about 3 million to 5 million cases of severe illness caused annually by seasonal influenza, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), but falls far short of the Spanish flu, which began in 1918 and infected an estimated 500 million people.Deaths related to Covid-19, the disease caused by the new virus, stood at 246,920. The first death was reported on January 10th in Wuhan, China, after the virus emerged there in December.The daily rate of new cases worldwide has been sitting in a 2 per cent-3 per cent range over the past week, versus a peak of around 13 per cent in mid-March, prompting many countries to begin easing lockdown measures that have upended businesses and crippled the global economy.The loosening of restrictions has proved controversial, however, as experts debate the best strategy to ensure there is no large “second wave” outbreak.Here are the latest updates on the pandemic from around the world:NEW ZEALANDNew Zealand reported no new cases of coronavirus on Monday, marking a significant moment that indicated the country’s bold strategy of trying to eliminate the virus was working.It was the first time since the outbreak took hold in mid-March that the country has reported zero new cases. New Zealand closed its borders and imposed a strict month-long lockdown after the outbreak began.The lockdown rules were eased a little last week to help reopen the economy, but many restrictions remain in place. Many businesses — including most retail stores and sit-down restaurants — remain closed, most schoolchildren are learning from home, and people are required to maintain social distancing.Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said a decision would be made next Monday on whether to ease the rules further. “We cannot afford to squander the good work to date when our end goal is so close and within reach,” she said.New Zealand has reported nearly 1,500 cases of the virus and 20 deaths.JAPANEconomy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters that experts supported the government’s plan to extend a state of emergency through to the end of May.Prime minister Shinzo Abe is set to formally announce an extension after the plan gets parliamentary approval later on Monday.Japan has more than 15,000 cases and 510 deaths, according to the health ministry.Mr Nishimura earlier said Tokyo and other prefectures being hit hard by the virus are expected to keep the emergency measures fully in place, while they could be eased elsewhere if ample preventive steps are taken.RUSSIAThe number of coronavirus cases in Russia has risen by 10,581 over the past 24 hours compared with a record of 10,633 on the previous day.This brought Russia’s nationwide tally to 145,268, the country’s coronavirus crisis response centre said on Monday.It also reported 76 new deaths from COVID-19, bringing the total death toll in Russia to 1,356.IRANThe coronavirus death toll in Iran, one of the hardest hit countries in the Middle East, rose by 74 in the past 24 hours to 6,277, the Health Ministry said on Monday, as mosques were due to reopen in many cities.The total number of diagnosed cases rose to 98,647, ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement on state TV.Iran was due to open mosques in 132 cities on Monday, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday, part of a broader plan to ease restrictions.In the areas where mosques reopen, worshippers must maintain social distancing, wear masks and gloves and not stay for more than half an hour, the ISNA news agency reported on Monday.Iran has already lifted a ban on inter-city trips and malls, with large shopping centres resuming activities despite warnings by some health officials of a new wave of infections.ICELANDHigh schools, hair salons, dentists and other businesses across Iceland are reopening after six weeks of lockdown, after the North Atlantic nation managed to tame its coronavirus outbreak.Iceland has confirmed 1,799 cases of the virus, but just 10 people have died. The number of new Covid-19 cases each day has fallen from 106 at the peak of the outbreak to single digits — even, on some days, zero.Iceland’s success reflects decisive action by authorities, who used a rigorous policy of testing and tracking to find and isolate infected people, even when they had no symptoms. Even so, Iceland’s chief epidemiologist, Thorolfur Gudnason, said: “I didn’t expect the recovery to be this fast.”MALAYSIAMany business sectors reopened in parts of Malaysia as prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin’s government sought to reach a balance between curbing the virus and reviving the hard-hit economy.But the move has split public opinion amid fears that the sudden reopening of economic activities could spark a new wave of infection.Nine of the country’s 13 states, including the richest state Selangor, either refused to reopen or restricted the list of businesses that can operate. Mass gatherings and interstate travel remain banned. Virus cases have dropped sharply in recent weeks but a slight rise of 227 infections was reported over the weekend. Malaysia has confirmed 6,298 cases, with 105 deaths.INDIAIndia has relaxed some lockdown restrictions even as the pace of infection has slightly accelerated.On Monday some economic activities resumed after a near-total five-week halt.Normal life, albeit with masks, social distancing and stringent hygiene standards, has started to return in low-risk areas, while constraints on movement and work continued elsewhere in the country.India has about 42,500 virus cases, 11,706 recoveries and 1,373 deaths, and had tested more than a million samples by Monday. But at 758 tests per million, India is among the countries testing the lowest fraction of their population. And experts warn that the virus has yet to peak.CHINAChina reported three new virus cases, all brought from overseas, and no new deaths.Just 481 people remain in hospitals with about 1,000 under monitoring and isolation for appearing to have the virus or for having tested positive but without showing symptoms.China has reported a total of 4,633 deaths from Covid-19 among 82,880 cases.VIETNAMStudents across Vietnam started returning to classrooms on Monday after being closed for three months.The schools require masks and temperature checks among measures to minimise the risk of outbreaks.Vietnam has confirmed 271 cases of Covid-19. It has not reported a new case in the community for nearly three weeks.All educational institutions were closed at the beginning of February when the first infections of coronavirus were reported in the country. All teaching activities were moved online. Last month, the country imposed travel restrictions and closed businesses for three weeks to contain the spread of the virus.-APReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/15/TELEMMGLPICT000229640337_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqzZqOgOJXOqkE_ZaqGDwVPIDFpkJIALGJc3DI2UF95ng.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"can learn germany butnot privatising national health service","story":"Free-marketeers have jumped on Germany\u0026#39s relatively good performance in this pandemic to argue that we should adopt its market-based health serviceDespite their popularity, international coronavirus league tables tell us remarkably little. Some countries are more urban than others. Some have older populations. Some have more of their elderly in care homes. Some have higher obesity rates. Some are global transport hubs. Some countries, like China, lie about their statistics. Some collect data quickly, while some do it slowly. Some risk overcounting in the pursuit of accuracy, and some undercount. Some were struck by the pandemic earlier than others.The league tables tell us, for example, that Belgium has the highest deaths per capita in Europe, and more than twice the death rate than the Netherlands. Belgian ministers believe that their statistics are an overestimate, while Dutch officials think they are undercounting.And this is not the only uncertainty about data. There remain many known unknowns about Covid-19 itself, such as its exact characteristics and symptoms, the nature of its transmission, and how to treat it. Until we have reliable treatments, and ideally a vaccine, the world will have to live with the virus. Until then, precise judgments about which countries did well or badly will have to wait.But politics never waits, and the Left has criticised the Government on policy and its implementation. Reliant upon hindsight, Labour have attacked ministers for locking down the country too late. On the NHS, they accuse the Tories of spending too little, leaving us with fewer beds than countries like Germany, fewer ventilators, and not enough protective equipment.From some on the Right, there are complaints that the lockdown has lasted too long, or should have never started. From people who have rarely argued that economic inequality can kill, we have heard concerns that the lockdown will cause avoidable deaths just as surely as the virus. And from others, we are beginning to hear the resumption of an old argument.Germany, some free-market reformers argue, has performed better in the battle against Covid-19 than other European countries. And Germany, they point out, has a market‑based health system, funded through insurance payments and delivered by a mix of private, public and charitable organisations. The pandemic, they hope, provides an opportunity to campaign for a similar system in Britain.Growth in coronavirus deaths over the last weekIt is true that Germany has weathered the storm relatively well so far. But as Angela Merkel said last week, the crisis there is far from over. Germany’s death rate among diagnosed Covid-19 patients rose from 0.7 per cent on 29 March to 3.8 per cent last week. And the median age of German Covid-19 patients, while lower than in France and Italy, has risen from 40 to 50.Germany does have more intensive care beds, ventilators and testing capacity than Britain. But per capita we spend only 67 per cent of what Germany spends on healthcare. And European countries that also rely on insurance-based health systems, like Spain, have not enjoyed Germany’s relative success to date.The rounder explanation for Germany’s preparedness, as the Berlin-based writer Bojan Pancevski argues, is its industrial capacity, decentralised state, and social partnership between government, employers and society. Its industrial capacity allowed mass testing, its federal system meant state governments could act early to meet the dangers specific to them, and its social partnership model meant universities and big businesses swung behind the state from the beginning.Germany does prove a market-based health system is possible without having to accept the injustices of America. But free-market reformers fail to recognise that our health system reflects a choice in values. By allowing richer patients to top up their own care, the German system puts freedom ahead of equality. By funding the NHS through taxation, we put equality ahead of freedom, and a clear majority of voters want to keep it that way.Suspecting that market-based systems are more efficient, several health secretaries – Tory and Labour – have for years sought to marketise parts of the NHS. But the internal market, which began as a sensible reform to establish price transparency and improve accountability, has ended up creating a Byzantine bureaucracy. Ask any NHS worker and they will give countless examples of inefficiency and waste created by this quasi-market.And this is the truth of the matter. We could have a market-based system, funded through insurance, if we so wished. But there is no evidence that the public wants this, or would tolerate the inequality in treatment it would cause. Equally, we can have a NHS, funded through general taxation. But a halfway house is doomed to fail. Instead, we have to run the NHS better.Inevitably, this will require more funding, to allow the NHS to catch up with rising demand and allow for the reality that we have to spend more over time because there are more old people. We should also reverse much of the internal market and overturn the Lansley reforms, which increased bureaucracy and destroyed accountability. And we need to go further in improving accountability, through data transparency and a stronger inspections framework.If we want to learn the real lessons from Germany, we should decentralise within the NHS, finding the right-sized units and structures to run it well and with better local accountability. We should seek a better balance between efficiency, and preparedness and resilience. We should improve our diagnostics capacity and increase domestic vaccine manufacturing capabilities. And we must find a funding solution for social care, which during the crisis has been shown without doubt to be in severe crisis.So yes, the NHS will need to change, but not in the ways envisaged by the free-market reformers. We need to be careful to draw the right conclusions from the pandemic, and ensure the NHS stays true to its founding values of fairness, solidarity and equality.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Coronavirus tests have been severely limited and the RIVM government health institute admits that deaths are likely to be higher than the official count of 5,056. After the first sunny weekend saw crowded beaches and parks, a visibly angry Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced a ban on adult groups of more than three, €390 fines and more local powers for mayors to shut risk areas.Many businesses have praised local government for being open to innovation during this period as well as offering bailouts and a €10 billion salary support scheme. Jeroen van Vliet, sales manager at Flexotels, used to rent 250 portacabins as hotel rooms for events now, the business has converted them into hygienic visitor cabins for care home residents. “The government has been open to ideas from industry and we haven’t had to get local permits, he says. It’s the Dutch mentality, being innovative and learning by doing. You have to see what you can do, not what you can’t.”Restaurants are finding their own ways to survive. The luxury RIJKS restaurant, for example, has created a pick-up service with video instructions for creating its signature millefeuille of beetroot and green gazpacho at home, and is now going “on tour” to other cities. “This whole crazy crisis means chefs being super creative,” says chef Joris Bijdendijk.After years of complaining about over-tourism, Amsterdam is now keen for visitors to return as soon as possible. Meanwhile hairdressers, masseuses and sex workers are waiting to hear when they can start business again.“This will be the worst recession we have had since the Second World War, I promise that,” says Bouwman. “But if we somehow manage to save the structure of the economy with allowances and state aid, and things are looking better on the virus side, then it will be easy to start up again.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/26/TELEMMGLPICT000230210856_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq9WvEVMUXXRGVdwl10TLNlu46KVnqi1_voHaByQqm4hw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"teenagers first hairdressers last plan lifting lockdown","story":"The idea of the country hiding from the sun and snitching on sunbathers in the summer months repels me as much as the virus itself doesLast week, I posted on Facebook my suggestion for lifting the lockdown. “If I was in charge, I’d let teenagers out on May Day – a Friday – so they could have a lovely weekend when the streets belong to them, meeting up in parks and on beaches. The following Monday, all places of education would open. Then on the first of each month a new set of things would open first non-essential shops, then bars and restaurants, then gyms and hairdressers.It would give the months a magical feeling as the country came alive again in the summertime. And it would be slow, so we could monitor what happens. By then it would be September, and we could either carry on opening up if infection falls, or go back into hibernation in autumnwinter if it was rising. But we’d have had some kind of a summer to get us through till spring 2021.”I was remarkably pleased with the visionary quality of my post and like a pig in muck with the copious quantities of “likes” that subsequently came my way. But a week is a long time in quarantine and I’m writing this on a wet and blustery May Day, so the kids wouldn’t exactly be living La Vida Loca anyway.Somewhat unsettlingly, an Ipso poll this week claimed that 60 per cent of people would be wary of returning to work, while a YouGov poll saw only 11 per cent of parents desirous of schools opening. As I get older I’ve been starting to see both sides of an argument, and as a hyper‑social lone wolf I’ve been quite laissez faire about lockdown. But on hearing the recommendations of this week’s Warwick University study that the over-50s, rather than just the over‑70s, should be kept in coronavirus lockdown for longer, it’s amazing how quickly I made up my mind, as I am 60 years old and still spry as an ibex.It’s worth noting that ethnic minorities and overweight people are also disproportionally affected imagine the ructions if some medical adviser suggested they stay at home indefinitely. Additionally, I’ve just heard on the radio that people going back to work are getting abuse from neighbours for “bringing back” the virus – which implies that the “community spirit” that was so lauded in the early weeks may be curdling into something more toxic.I’ve always believed the British to be a rebellious people, so I prefer to put a cheery spin on the Ipso poll: that we trust our Prime Minister more than most other nations do theirs. We’re so disillusioned with liars who present themselves as Good Guys (Blair, Brown) that we respond positively to a cad who seems capable of becoming a better person. (I always prefer vice-signallers to virtue-signallers – we’re more fun and generally, paradoxically, nicer.)As Mr Johnson has suffered the plague, he seems one of us in yet another way, notorious for being all too human. If he seems fearful of lifting lockdown, knowing what we do of his past recklessness, we really believe it would be unwise. I hope that our newfound agoraphobia is, more than anything, a vote of confidence in him. Amusingly, in a strange collision of bedfellows, those who most loathe Boris are massive lockdowners.I understand that self-isolation was desirable at a certain point, but so are many things which one doesn’t necessarily want to last forever. The idea of my fellow citizens becoming a mole-like species hiding from the brazen benediction of the sun and snitching on sunbathers repels me as much as the virus itself does.Politicians must now concentrate on hope – that shy but vital sister of faith and charity – because without it there is literally no reason to carry on. People without it aren’t just defeatist, they’re dangerous as they have nothing to lose – and no politician wants a defeatist and dangerous electorate.After six weeks of making us live in limbo, our rulers would be wise to consider that as they plan the forthcoming summer, haunted by the spectre of its own imminence.

But our research shows that this isn’t the case – children want to talk to parents about upsetting content, as 60 per cent of 6-15 year olds we spoke to said they’d approached a parent to talk about what they had seen. We’re here to support parents to help their children to navigate the online world safely, and to choose content well. We know that using age appropriateness as a guide to what’s suitable plays a valuable part in helping children, young people, carers and parents navigate the film, video and website content around them. We are encouraging all parents to have open, frank and honest discussions with their children about what they’re watching online. With increased time spent online, we must ensure that children have the tools they need to choose content well. Our homeschooling initiative – supported by Government and leading children’s charities including Barnardos, Childnet and the PSHE Association – gives parents free, easily accessible resources through our website to help them educate their children while at home. On our social media accounts we’re also pointing to family friendly, educational shows to stream, and we’ve launched movie packs so that families can watch films together and discuss them afterwards. These educational resources also help children develop resilience, and get them thinking about how their choices affect them and those around them.  For parents’ peace of mind, and childrens’ healthy development and wellbeing, our trusted age ratings and ratings info are also there to give parents, and children, the guidance and information they need. This is more true during lockdown than at any time before. Today, children need to be able to make the right decisions for themselves – they need to choose well. So our expert advice and straightforward tools that help families decide what to watch with confidence is more relevant than ever.But parents, charities and regulators need more support to protect children. Platforms have a role to play. 500 hours of videos are uploaded to YouTube every hour – the majority without appropriate content warnings, or age ratings. From this research, we know that 82 per cent of parents and three quarters of children want to see our well known, trusted age ratings on platforms like YouTube. What a difference it would make, for example, if these platforms had trusted BBFC signposts, created by those uploading or watching the video, linked to filters that parents and young people recognise from the cinema, DVD and Blu-ray and online platforms such as Netflix. We can work in partnership with video sharing  platforms to give families the information and advice that they tell us they want. That we know will help parents and help keep their children safe online. We know that means they need a quick and simple to use ratings tool. In partnership with colleagues in the Netherlands, the BBFC has developed YouRateIt, which allows uploaders to easily rate their content and viewers to both validate ratings and rate content simply and quickly with the help of an intelligent algorithm. YouRateIt provides clear traffic light ratings – green meaning suitable for younger children, amber meaning suitable for older children and teenagers, and red for adults only – that help audiences choose the right content for them and helps keep children safer online. We are ready and eager to work with platforms to develop it to fit their needs and the needs of their users, and implement it. Now, more than ever, we need to work together to protect children online by giving them the information they need to choose content well, so they can stay safe in lockdown and beyond. David Austin is chief executive of the BBFCThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

But Japan’s Nikkei 225 index slipped 2.8 per cent to 19,619.35 while the S\u0026ampPASX 200 in Australia gave up 4.2 per cent to 5,289.40.The future for the S\u0026ampP 500 lost 1.7 per cent while that for the Dow industrials gave up 1.5 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe S\u0026ampP 500 fell 0.9 per cent on Thursday after reports showed millions more US\u0026nbspworkers filed for unemployment benefits last week and the European economy crumpled to its worst performance on record last quarter, among other lowlights. It was the biggest loss for the US\u0026nbspstock market in more than a week, but just a wiggle within the S\u0026ampP 500’s 12.7 per cent gain for April, its best month in decades.“Maybe it was the whole month-end malaise, or maybe they just need to hear something new and impactful, and that we’re ultimately seeing buying fatigue,” Chris Weston of Pepperstone said in a commentary.Wall Street suffers worst fall in three weeks amid falling oil pricesTrump defends virus response with newspaper op-ed and Cuomo videoThis is what Trump should’ve actually done to save the economyUS stock market falling faster than during the Wall Street CrashPromises from the Federal Reserve and other central banks to do whatever it takes to prop up the economy through the coronavirus crisis have supported buying by investors betting that a recovery will come soon. Professional investors say that optimism may be premature.“The rebound in April was an assumption that this was going to be a short, V-shaped recovery, both economically and at the corporate and business level,” said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J P\u0026nbspMorgan Private Bank.“In our view, it probably has gotten a little ahead of itself. We think it’s going to be a longer and slower recovery.”The month’s gains for stocks came in the face of mayhem in the oil market, where prices in one corner dipped below zero for the first time, and as investors continued to rush into US\u0026nbspgovernment bonds in search of safety. Reports piled up by the day showing the severe hits the economy is taking from widespread stay-at-home orders meant to slow the spread of the virus.US\u0026nbspbenchmark crude picked up 46 cents to $19.30 (£15.44) per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It is\u0026nbspstill way below the roughly $60 (£47.99) level where it started the year as worries pile up about the effects of a collapse in demand and as storage tanks fill close to their limits.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.2 per cent\u0026nbspto 24,345.72, and the Nasdaq fell 0.3 per cent\u0026nbspto 8,889.55.The US\u0026nbspjobless figures brought the total to 30 million in just six weeks, while consumer spending plunged a record 7.5 per cent\u0026nbspin March from the prior month. That is\u0026nbspcrucial for an economy where consumer spending makes up 70 per cent of the total.US unemployment hits another record high as 4.4m more workers fileAmong European countries that\u0026nbspuse the euro, the economy shrank by 3.8 per cent\u0026nbspin the first three months of the year from the quarter before in the biggest contraction since records began in 1995. Discouraging data also came in on China’s economy, which is concerning for anyone expecting a first-in-first-out economic wave.“This is the saddest day for the global economy we have ever seen” in the 50 years that economists at High Frequency Economics have been following economic data, they wrote in a report. “The statistical offices of the economies we watch pumped out 19 economic reports overnight. They revealed historic declines of activity and surging unemployment on a scale we have never seen before. We are sad.”The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 0.61 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 0.63 per cent\u0026nbsplate on Thursday. It started the year close to 1.90 per cent. Treasury yields tend to fall when investors are downgrading their expectations for the economy and inflation.In currency trading, the dollar fetched 107.09 Japanese yen, down from 107.13 yen on Thursday. The euro rose to $1.0963 (£0.88) from $1.0955.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The comments appeared to lead the share price to drop immediately, falling 10 per cent in the wake of the posts.Elon Musk tweets \u0027FREE AMERICA NOW\u0027 in criticism of lockdownNow give people back their FREEDOM, the third post read. Mr Musk then posted the final lines of the US national anthem.In recent days, many of Mr Musk\u0027s posts have criticised the government lockdown and attempted to suggest that the public are misled over the scale of the coronavirus crisis.In a flurry of tweets earlier this week, he posted FREE AMERICA NOW and Give people their freedom back.He also used a Tesla earnings call to attack the lockdown as fascistic as part of a impassioned diatribe.Mr Musk has been known to use his Twitter account to post controversial and unusual messages in the past.He has said in the past that the strange nature of those messages has led to Twitter locking his account, fearing that they had been posted by a hacker.Created with Sketch.Armed protests against stay-at-home coronavirus measures in Michigan Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A demonstrator shouts next to two masked security guards at the state Capitol in Lansing, Michigan during a protest against stay-at-home ordersArmed members of a milita group at the state Capitol building in Lansing, Michiga, during a protest against coronavirus lockdown measuresA protester at the state Capitol in Lansing holds a sign comparing Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer to Adolf Hitler during a demonstration against coronavirus lockdown measuresAn armed protester takes part in a demonstation against lockdown measures at the state Capitol in Lansing, MichiganA protester holds a sign saying \u0027Bill Gates is evil\u0027 at a demonstration against stay-at-home orders at the state Capitol in Lansing, Michigan.

But they have largely attempted to do that by impersonating him, including taking control of other verified accounts and making them look as if they were Mr Musk\u0027s official account.The new outburst came as Nasa announced that one of Mr Musk\u0027s other companies, SpaceX, was one of three firms in the running to make the lunar lander for humanity\u0027s return to the moon\u0027s surface. SpaceX already has a number of key contracts with the US government, including one that will see it send Nasa astronauts to the International Space Station in a matter of weeks.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It then came to the MacBook Air last month.The introduction of the keyboard into Apple’s smaller Pro laptop means that the old, controversial “butterfly” keyboard is now fully removed from Apple’s line-up.Otherwise, the computer keeps largely the same design at its larger sibling. It keeps the Touch Bar at the top of the keyboard that includes a smaller screen for shortcuts, as well as the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and the aluminium model.But Apple has added a host of new upgrades on the inside, including double the storage of the previous generation, going up to 1TB, and new processors. The company now offers 16GB of memory as standard and up to 32GB, which was not available in any previous generations of 13-inch MacBook.It costs £1,299, though Apple stressed it wil offer cheaper prices to those in education. It is available to order now and will begin arriving to customers later this week.Apple has continued to release products through the coronavirus lockdown, despite its significant impact on its day-to-day operations.

The company has developed rechargeable, lithium-ion battery-storage projects called Tesla PowerPack and Powerwall, which have been used in Wales\u0026nbspand other parts of the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe company also built the world’s-largest lithium-ion battery in South Australia, which Tesla claims\u0026nbspcan provide enough power for more than 30,000 homes.However, rather than being a direct energy provider, the company could also be using the application to launch its Autobidder service in the UK, which uses machine-learning to give information to other companies so they can better “autonomously monetize battery assets,” according to a company product page.How Tesla revolutionised the electic car marketTesla recently partnered with Octopus in the UK for Tesla car owners who have solar panels or a Powerwall to offer cheaper energy.“Your solar system, Powerwall and EV charging are connected to Tesla’s energy management platform. It is designed to improve the way you use your energy to power your lifestyle and allows any stored by your Powerwall to be exported back to the grid, to benefit both you and the community” the company wrote on an FAQ page.\u0026nbspWhether these activities are part of its application remains to be seen we have reached out to the company for comment.On Friday, Tesla founder Elon Musk deducted $14bn (£11.2bn) from the company\u0027s value after tweeting that the company’s stock was “too high” in a series of tweets where the CEO also said he would be selling almost all of his possessions.Asked whether the tweets had been checked by his lawyers before being posted, Musk said “No”.Musk has also tweeted about the lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which he called\u0026nbsp“fascistic”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Between 50 to 60 per cent of the entire population will have to use it in order for it to have a real impact. That figure means the app will need to become as ubiquitous as WhatsApp in the space of just a few months.Mr Gove said that “the more people who download the app the better” and was optimistic that people would decide to download it.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“It’s striking how publicly spirited people have been throughout the crisis, and knowing that this is a contribution all of us can make to help keep our neighbours and our communities safer is a very powerful incentive, I think,” he said.On Sunday the government said 28,466 people are now known to have died due to coronavirus in the UK – a rise of 315 since Saturday.The figure puts the UK death toll higher than that of Spain, which has the greatest number of known cases of Covid-19 in Europe and just below Italy’s which is currently at 28,884.The UK is on course to become the worst affected country in Europe and the second-worst in the world, in terms of deaths, after the United States where 68,602 people have died.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A replacement will be announced in due course.”In a damning response to Ms Stone’s investigation, the Commons Committee on Standards said the MP had “used his parliamentary position in an attempt to intimidate a member of the public into doing as Mr Burns wished, in a dispute relating to purely private family interests which had no connection with Mr Burns’ parliamentary duties”.Boris Johnson says he feared never meeting his newborn son WilfredJohnson’s mindless optimism won’t pull us out of this crisisJobs on line if Johnson gets lockdown exit strategy wrongJohnson’s bluff and bluster will not be enough against StarmerThe committee found that he “persisted in making veiled threats to use parliamentary privilege to further his family’s interests even during the course of the commissioner’s investigation, and … misleadingly implied that his conduct had the support of the House authorities”.The committee – which includes lay members as well as MPs – took the highly unusual step of recommending a seven-day suspension, which is almost certain to be upheld by the Commons.In a tweet, Mr Burns said: “With deep regret I have decided to resign as Minister of State for International Trade. Boris Johnson\u0026nbspwill continue to have my wholehearted support from the backbenches.”Only scant details are given in today’s report of the financial dispute in which Mr Burns intervened.The standards commissioner said she was approached by the complainant – who is not identified – over a letter on Commons headed notepaper received in February last year.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the charge is being a caring son, I would accept it,” he said.The commissioner found that Mr Burns’ use of Commons notepaper in his correspondence with the complainant appeared “more deliberate than accidental”.The report said: “The Commissioner concludes that Mr Burns should have realised that the words used in his letter would be received as a threat, and on the balance of probabilities she thinks that that was Mr Burns’ intention.The commissioner also revealed that during the course of the inquiry, Mr Burns suggested that it would be “ironic” if the complaint led to the revelation of details of the dispute which the complainant had previously attempted to keep concealed. Ms Stone said this suggestion was not “respectful of the standards system of the House”.Stating that it would be possible for the MP to give an apology without revealing details of the dispute, she added: “Mr Burns’ conduct in this matter does not reflect well on him personally.“However, I think his conduct has a wider impact. It gives fuel to the belief that Members are able and willing to use the privileges accorded them by their membership of the House to benefit their own personal interests. That Mr Burns has not acted on his threat to use parliamentary privilege will do little to dispel that belief.”Ms Stone’s report was completed last October but publication was delayed by the general election.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Staff at The Berkeley hotel give food to ambulance workersOne of a small group of anti-lockdown protesters speaks to a police officer as they gather outside New Scotland Yard in Victoria, LondonBonnie the Llama grazes in a field in the Scottish Borders alongside a sign supporting the NHS as the UK continues in lockdownColonel Tom Moore and his daughter Hannah celebrate his 100th birthday, with an RAF flypast provided by a Spitfire and a Hurricane over his home in Marston Moretaine.

I am sorry I did so and regret it.”He added: “My motivation was to try and get the company to engage with my father on a long running dispute. To this day they have not done so and my father is taking court action. This has had a significant negative impact on his health.“At the time I wrote I was under a huge amount of personal stress as I explained to the Commissioner privately.“It has been very distressing to me that I have added to my elderly father’s worries. To be asked every week by him if there is news on the inquiry has been very hard to take.“I profoundly regret involving myself in this in any way and if I could turn the clock back I would not have done it.“- A second Tory minister, Greg Hands, was told to apologise after admitting using free Commons stationery and postage worth a total of around £4,500 to send a newsletter to constituents in his Hammersmith and Fulham seat.The standards committee noted that the international trade minister\u0026nbspinitially agreed to issue an apology, acknowledge he had breached Westminster rules\u0026nbspand pay for the mailshot. However, a few days later he withdrew his offer.The committee noted that his move came shortly after the prime minister called a general election and said that he may well have been motivated by the desire\u0026nbsp to avoid the embarrassment of having to make a public apology for breaking parliamentary rules during an election campaign.In a report upholding Ms Stone\u0027s finding that Mr Hands had breached the rules, the committee said he should make a personal statement of apology to the Commons, not only for his breach but also for his inappropriate conduct in forcing a delay to the conclusion of his case.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That is very, very different from being free to say what your advice is. In others words, there is a complete unity between what the scientists are saying and what the politicians are saying.Pressed on whether the scientists were not free to speak and deferring to ministers, he replied: “I believe that’s the case the case, yes.”“I think there\u0027s a very big difference between the situation today and the situation as it was in 2010-11, that is quite simply the permission to speak in the public domain has been changed.“I think the main point I\u0027m making is that an independent science advisory group really needs to be dominated by people whose income is not determined by the fact they are working for the government.”In a separate interview on Sky News, he added: “At the moment when ministers say they are following the science advice, I’m just a little worried because I don’t know what the specifics of the advice are.

total, which was at about 10,000 when Mr Hancock set his target at the start of April and was hovering around 20,000 little more than a week ago, was rapidly increased over the past few days with the expansion of eligibility to wider groups of people and the establishment of 49 drive-through centres and 96 mobile testing units.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and

sent to satellite sites within the health service, which were counted on dispatch rather than after they have been returned to labs and analysed.Mr Hancock heralded the expansion in testing as an “incredible achievement”.He said: “I knew that it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal, because testing is so important for getting Britain back on her feet.”He praised his team for working “tirelessly… with grit and determination” to reach the goal.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out. Tonight’s headline figure shouldn’t count tests that hadn’t been used -\u0026nbspor indeed, might never be used - as a completed test. Ministers promised transparency - the public and NHS staff deserve clarity.“In any event, this figure was never a strategy. We need a fully resourced testing, isolation and tracing programme and ministers should be using this lockdown time to put the fundamentals of infectious disease control in place.”Mr Hancock said that the testing capacity now available was “crucial to suppress the virus” and would “help us to unlock the lockdown”.It would be backed up by an initial 18,000 contact-tracers to be in place by the middle of May, with more to be recruited if required.“The combination of contact tracers and new technology, through our new Covid-19 NHS app, will help tell us where the virus is spreading and help everyone to control new infections,” he said.Speaking a day after prime minister Boris Johnson promised a “roadmap” out of lockdown, Mr Hancock said: “In recent weeks we’ve had to impinge on historic liberties to protect our NHS and our loved ones and yet our goal must be freedom.“Freedom from the virus, yes - and we will not lift measures until it is safe to do so - but also we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom too – each citizen’s right to do as they please.“For now, we’re working together to stay home, we’re impinging on the freedom of all for the safety of all.“With this next mission of test, track and trace, I’m seeking a solution that allows us, by each of us participating, to target the measures that are needed with much more precision and so to reassert, as much as is safely possible, the liberty of us all.”Prof Newton rejected suggestions that the UK’s slow adoption of mass testing had “kept us in lockdown a day longer”.Stay-at-home measures were introduced in March not because of a lack of tests but because of the wide circulation of the Covid-19 virus in the population, he said.“Cases were popping up with no obvious connection to other cases and the infection was entering the exponential growth phase and at that point access to limitless testing even if we had had it would’ve made no difference,” he said.“The decision to enter into lockdown would have been the same and would’ve been taken at the same time.“In the same way the route out of lockdown has not been blocked by low levels of testing. We can relax social distancing only when the Government’s five tests are met, and that means particularly getting the infection rate right down.“Testing will help to keep it out of control once we’re out of lockdown but our levels of testing have not kept us in lockdown a day longer.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It survived, but only narrowly.“The racism and the events leading up to the riots were multi-faceted,” says Park, now aged 40. “The riots were America’s first multi-ethnic riots. Prior to this we were always looking at things from a black-white paradigm.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile the role on the acquittal of the officers who beat Rodney King in triggering the riots is well known, less widely appreciated was the impact of the shooting dead of a black teenager,\u0026nbspLatasha Harlins, by a Korean-American storekeeper on 16 March, 1991, less than two weeks after video was broadcast of the beating of King.Tensions between the Asian-American and black communities had been worsening for decades, says Park.

She says the racism that prevented African-Americans rising in the corporate sector\u0026nbspalso stopped Korean-Americans. Instead, pressured to pursue the “American dream”, many opened businesses as an alternative, including in a number of traditionally black neighbourhoods. “They come in and they set up their shops and there are cultural differences and there’s miscommunication,” she says.She adds: “They were being basically blamed. And they took the brunt of this blame. And when the LA riots broke out, this was the frustration that was vented towards the Korean community, whose businesses were targeted and torched and burnt down and damaged.”In the violence that ensured after the April 29 court ruling, says Park, of 4,000 business that were destroyed, around 2,300 belonged to Korean-Americans. Of the estimated $1bn of damage perpetrated, 40 per cent was inflicted on Asian-Americans, who armed themselves and formed self-help groups as the police failed for days to stop the killing and looting.Edward Chang, professor of ethnic studies and founding director of the Young Oak Kim Centre for Korean American studies at the University of California, Riverside, says “Korean-Americans suffered disproportionately high economic losses”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And she looked out the window and she said ‘It’s still there, but it looks like something across the street is burning’.”How the LA riots inspired one student to become a social activistHow The Independent covered the LA riots on this day in historyWhat it was like covering the LA riots of 1992Remembering the moment the Rodney King verdict was delivered Park says the relationship with African-Americans has altered as the demographics of Compton and other neighbourhoods have shifted and become more Latino. Another reason\u0026nbspis that Korean Americans have become more politically active.“Prior to the LA riots, Korean-Americans were not as visible. They were not as politically active. He did not have a voice. But after the riots, we realised we\u0026nbspmust have that voice. And that meant getting involved with politics, coalition building,” she says.“Today if you look at the Korean-American community, we are visible. We are in politics. David Ryu is the fist person of Korean descent\u0026nbspon the LA city council.”Other things, she say, remain unaltered.“When we come to talk about racial strife, has that changed? I would say, in general, no, we have not learned the lessons of racism. Structural racism, institutionalised racism, and all these various things within our communities,” she says.“If you look at our current climate, especially given the pandemic, and the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes, that gives us all the answers we need. We are just going back to the days of yellow peril, when we viewed Asian-Americans as a threat.\u0026nbspSo has racism changed? No. I think it’s still an issue and we have a long way to go before we can actually fix this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But this 28th anniversary is really present in my mind because of the pandemic,” she says.“I think that what became really important to us was connecting with everyone that we work with through our organising work. That’s a lesson we learned in the 92 uprising that is still true and even more critical today.”A number of reports have highlighted how people of colour have been disproportionately infected and killed by the coronavirus, partly because of pre-existing bad health, or because of lack of easy access to healthcare once the virus struck.She also draws a parallel to the large number of people of colour – again hugely disproportionate – who had been incarcerated at the time of the riots. Now, authorities in cities such as Los Angeles are failing to respond quickly to help release into the community those in jail and at high risk of becoming infected.“We started calling on the county to de-incarcerate vulnerable residents who had underlying health conditions or are over 60, who didn’t have serious offences who are really there because they cannot afford to pay bail,” she says.Asked about the structural racism that remains in place in 2020, she says: “It\u0026nbsp troubles me that the structural racism that existed before the 1992 civil unrest and still exists, is alive and well during this pandemic.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When she returned, the National Guard was already on the streets of her home.“It was that experience that resulted in me working as a community organiser, doing social justice work three decades later, right in my community. I am grateful I get to do the work that I do. Yet, I am both troubled and alarmed by what this pandemic and economic downturn will do for families in Los Angeles, for black and brown families in South Los Angeles. I am worried it’s going to take years and decades for us to rebuild.”She says “race and equality” have to be at the centre of any conversations taking place about the response to the virus, and the longer-term recovery.She adds: “The lesson we learned that is that residents have to be engaged, they have to be at the forefront of any decisions that are made by public leaders.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But what needs to happen before the Government can justy relaxing measures It was reported on Sunday, April , that Boris Johnson could set out his plan to ease the lockdown before the May  deadline.The Prime Minister, who ed to work on Monday, April , has already discussed with ministers the idea of modying the lockdown restrictions before the deadline.Any change to the UK lockdown will involve modying it rather than lting it.Its understood that restrictions will stay in place evenworkplaces and schools reopen.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealA vaccine for Covid- is the ultimate goal but is likely to take at least six months to a year before its made available.Meanwhile, testing is of the utmost importance - with hopes being pinned on the antibody test, which can tella person has had the disease and is immune to it.So what needs to happen before lockdown can be lted Matt Hancock revealed on April  that million people were eligible for coronavirus tests.This was increased the initial m which included just key workers and their families - with those eligible able to visit one of the drive through testing centres around the country.Brits without a car will be offered a home test, including swabs and instructions – with , kits sent out daily before the scheme is ramped up.They will be delivered by Amazon within  hours, before being collected the next day by Royal Mail.All those tested will get their results by text within  hours of having their swab taken.Mass testing is believed to be Britains exit strategy for beating coronavirus and lting the lockdown.According to University College Londons Professor Anthony Costello, the lockdown could be lted in six to eight weeksthe Government follows in the footsteps of South Korea underwent a period of mass testing, which led to getting Covid- relatively under control.Meanwhile, Professor Neil Ferguson, whose team at Imperial College London has been advising the Government, hinted that current restrictions would almost certainly be lted once testing is ramped up.He told the BBC: “We want case numbers to get to a low point where we can start substituting other measures for the most intrusive and economically costly aspects of the current lockdown and almost certainly these additional measures will involve massively ramped up testing going back to trying to identy contacts of cases and stopping chains of transmission.“That can only feasibly be done when we have many fewer cases per day than we have at the moment.”The Government has rolled out plans to bump up mass testing.Other countries such as China and Germany have used mass testing to great effect to identy those most at risk and isolate areas where there are hotspots.The NHS is currently working on a contact tracing app which would noty peoplethey have come into close contact with someone who later tests positive for coronavirus.It will allow people to quickly self-isolate before spreading it to too many people.The strategy was successful in other countries including South Korea, where just  people have died from Covid-.The second strategy is social distancing - and the Governments rules are to stay at home and only leave the houseyou absolutely have to.Officials say the only reason you should be leaving your house are:These reasons are exceptions - but even when doing these activities, you should be minimising time spent outside of the home.You must also ensure you are two metres apart from anyone outside of your household.If you have even mild or seemingly unrelated symptoms then you must self isolate until days after they pass or you will infect others and that has a knock-on effect.Those who are at very high risk of coronavirus, such as the elderly or those with underlying conditions, have been asked to rigorously follow shielding measures in order to keep themselves safe.This group of highly vulnerable people have been written to by the NHS and advised to stay at home at all times.While the UK is past the containment stage, tracking is still important and will continue to be even once cases peak.Iceland, with a relatively small population of around ,, has been using detectives to track down potential contact cases and testing aggressively since the outset to isolate everyone, including those who are remotely at risk but show no symptoms.This draconian action, led by scientists and civil servants instead of politicians, has led to them becoming one of the only countries in the world not to enforce lockdown measures.Similar measures were used at the beginning of the outbreak in the UK but werent as effective and the country moved to the delay phase.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres everything you need to know.No, but they will be.The majority of councils closed refuse facilities due to staff absences and to comply with social distancing guidelines as part of lockdown in March, but were ordered to reopen last week.Councils acted without any formal instruction from the Government, which deem dumps an essential service.Announcing the dumps order to the Commons on Monday, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said: “Our binmen and women have done a fantastic job maintaining the vast majority of collections.”But he added: “I am asking councils to plan the organised reopening of household waste collection sites. I expect this to happen over the coming weeks.”Parts of the country were left with household waste collection services only, triggering a  per cent rise in fly-tipping.The first reopenings of dumps in Bolton and Manchester caused massive tailbacks of over  cars.A spokesperson for the County Councils Network - representative of England’s  county councils - said: “Councils would like to have kept recycling centres open during this period.“However, government guidance was clear that a journey to a household waste recycling centre was not considered essential travel.However,  per cent of bin collections have been continuing to collect recyclable waste during this time.Robert Jenrick, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government asked councils to open tips and recycling centres.He asked them to be reopened within the coming weeks, amid worries there has been a rise in fly-tipping since they closed.He said: Our bin men and women have done a fantastic job maintaining the vast majority of collections.“I’m asking councils to plan the organised re-opening of household waste collection sites. I expect this to happen over the coming weeks and will be publishing amended guidance shortly.”Officials are issuing advice to councils to ensure they can safely operate amid the coronavirus pandemic.Sites in Greater Manchester and Bolton opened again on May , but with social distancing measures in place - including a one-in-one-out policy.However, Derbyshire County Council said it was unable to say when services would resume.And North Yorkshire County Council said sites will remain closed for public safety and to cut non-essential travel.The Greater Manchester Combined Authority says an odd and even number plate system is in place to reduce the number of vehicles on site, reports the BBC.Hampshire County Council suggested daily cleaning and a reduction in the number of vehicles on-site.Lancashire County Council and Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council have plans to implement an online booking system, where households can choose a slot to drop off their rubbish.Similarly, Wirral Council suggested a one-way system and a reduction of vehicles to just three at a time.Northumberland County Council will also be reducing the number of vehicles and advise people to remain in their cars when queuing.Surrey County Council said fewer types of waste will be accepted.All workers will also require PPE.Find out whether your local recycling centre is open by heading to your councils website.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially when you are dealing with a government like China’s.As viewers of the series Chernobyl know, non-democratic governments have a history of covering up their errors.In that case, the Soviets did everything they could to stop the world learning about the meltdown at their nuclear reactor.Today the Communist Party of China has done everything it can to hide what happened in Wuhan. Especially the origins of the disease which has shut down the world.Yesterday President Trump broke one of the taboos in all this. Which is needed.The question is: What is the likelihood the coronavirus originated in the exact part of China that has a laboratory looking into just such viruses To date the Chinese authorities have allowed the world to believe in the bat-eating, wet-market theory on the origins of the epidemic.They prefer embarrassment over suspicion.But all along, people have wondered whether something less “accidental” is at play.Now the US President has told reporters he has seen strong evidence that Covid- originated from the laboratory in Wuhan. The President’s remarks change the game.China should be in enough trouble as it is. Evenit was true that the virus is an accident caused by a strange food custom, the Chinese Communist Party has a lot to answer for.Why did it keep the news of the virus to itself for so many weeks  Why did it pretend it is not lethal as we now know it is Or pretend that it was hard to transmit  Why did they refuse to allow in inspectors from the World Health Organisation And why have the WHO now been refused inclusion in China’s own investigation into the origins of Covid- Questions also remain over the WHO’s seeming collusion with China over the crisis.The CCP’s actions would be bad enoughthe virus came from a wet market. But it must know that it is in a whole dferent realm of troublethe virus turns out to have come from its lab.If the CCP knew all along the virus had leaked from there then its cover-up is even more appalling. Because it means they knew exactly what they — and soon the world — were dealing with.But in the absence of trust-worthy information, darker and wilder theories take shape in the shadows. For example, could the virus have come from the Wuhan lab and been released deliberately To those deeply skeptical of the CCP, it’s not hard to believe it might have done that.They are in a trade war with America with a President who was making them lose. Now the CCP has managed to shut down the entire US economy with a virus.The question for the rest of the world will soon be simple: What to do about this There are several steps. The first is to try to determine exactly how this virus came about. To have an international  look into every possible cause. With no area of inquiry ruled out.That  should also investigate how the communist regime lied their way through this virus. We need to learn just how they managed to make a local problem into a global one.Then there is the question of what price they should pay. For accidental or not, there is no way that the CCP should be allowed to get away with this.Goodness knows they have tried. Throughout this crisis there have been a set of PR gestures by the Chinese authorities.The government and government-linked firms such as Huawei have made a big show of donating masks and other equipment.It is dismal. Like watching somebody who has just burned down your house offering you a watering can.Last month, German newspaper Bild infuriated China by suggesting Beijing should pay reparations for the coronavirus pandemic.It printed an “invoice’ for nearly billion eurosleading the Chinese embassy in Berlin to accuse the paper of stirring up prejudice.But once the engine of the other global economies — including ours — roars back into motion, we must make China pay.We must re-think our relationship with them. We should recognise the country is not just a competitor but a liability.We must punish them for the large-scale theft of information from British and American businesses it has engaged in for years.We must do whatever we can to disrupt their “belt-and-road” empire-building, which the CCP has worked its way into, and “bought up” small and poor countries.But it is not only such countries that are at the mercy of China and its President Xi Jinping. We may be in Britain too.Before this Wuhan disaster kicked off, our Government approved Huawei to provide part of our G capability.All of our allies warned against this. Our intelligence-sharing partners in the Five Eyes networkall strongly warned the British Government against allowing a firm that is indistinguishable from the CCP from having such access.Experience shows Chinese firms cannot be trusted to provide such sensitive — and strategic — technology.The Huawei decision was a rare misstep by the Johnson government. Now is the time to correct it.We do not need to provoke China. But nor do we need to pander to it. And we should not be putting our future security in their hands.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Living by the sea, in paradise, with a triangular- torsoed Hollywood hunk.But thenyou take a glance at your social media, you’ll notice that absolutely everyone  is living the Hemsworth dream.It’s an endless parade of people’s perfect sourdough baking and of jolly board games with the kids.This morning, my Instagram feed featured a young family doing a fancy dress dinner, a girl on an enormous horse, a woman sprawled on the bonnet of a Mercedes SL, a man with a cute dog, doing exercises, and a shot of some cows taken through a wisteria bush.On Instagram, no one is ever bored, it never rains and everyone’s breasts are perfect. Especially Chris Hemsworth’s.This is having an effect on the nation’s teenagers. They have been told there will be no exams this year and that all their school work was for nothing. They’ve been told they have to stay indoors and that they can’t see their friends.And it’s driving them mad because they do not read newspapers. They do not listen to the BBC news. And they replaced Radio  with Spoty five years ago.This means they never hear any actual news. So they don’t know what’s going on.Instead they look at their phonesand all they can see are pretty girls with swimsuits up their a*** cheeks, and Chris Hemsworth, and parents who have turned the cellar into a nightclub and lots of cute ducklings.And they’re thinking, as they watch the rain trickle down the windows at their house: “Why can’t I have some of that ”But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

So I’ve come up with another idea . . .If you are an old person stuck in a tower block, waiting for Covid- to stick its warty little head through the letterbox, post a picture of your surroundings on Instagram. Don’t hold back. Show us the overflowing cat litter and the photograph of your husband, alone in his hospital bed.Show us also pictures of your sister who is in a care home and hasn’t had a visitor for five weeks.And your food cupboard which has nothing in it any more. And your empty bottle of Senokot.In fact, we should all get in on the act. Don’t wait for a joyous moment to photograph and share. Send us instead pictures of stuff you didn’t enjoy.The particularly gruesome bit of wax you’ve just pulled out of your left ear. The turd your dog just did on the mat. Your fat other half slobbing out in front of the TV.Your kids throwing Monopoly pieces at one another after a row over Fenchurch Street station.Instead of sharing your perfect loaf, send pictures of the charred wreck that went wrong, the scarf full of dropped stitches, the wonky self-assembly garden furniture that broke the first time you sat on it.Hit us with the reality of lockdown. Admit that it’s one part happiness and nine parts ditch water.And then maybe teenagers will start to understand that le is bookended by the lucky and the not so lucky. At one end you’ve got the Hemsworths. At the other you’ve got a frightened old man in a tenement block in Bermondsey.Maybe then they will understand they are somewhere in the middle, and stop bloody complaining.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.There is much debate about what increases your chances of dying from Covid-.Well, I don’t know about you but I’ve addressed the issue by sitting on a sofa for six hours a day, eating slabs of Cadbury’s Fruit  Nut chocolate and getting up only to go to the fridge for another bottle of wine.I guess I’m working on the principle that soon I’ll be so fat, there won’t be room in the house for me and the virus as well.But there is one problem.There are now so many empty bottles sitting by the bins at the bottom of the drive I just know my neighbours will assume I’ve been throwing illegal parties, and call the police.A nurse made headlines this week after moaning about the cramped conditions on a London Tube train at .am.She said she was risking her le at work and pointed out that she shouldn’t have to risk it even more while commuting. Fair point, you might think. But hang on.In the olden days – before March – people may well have been on a Tube train at that time because they were coming home from a club.But these days, nobody on a Tube train at quarter to six in the morning is there for fun. They’re ALL going to work.There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s what most of us have been told to do all along. But I do agree that commuting on a cramped Tube is bloody dangerous.So I ask once again for parking restrictions to be lted immediately, as this would allow people to go to work in the blissful self-isolation of their own cars.I WAS told this week, by The Times newspaper no less, that this summer’s must-have accessory is a straw handbag. No it isn’t.As no one’s looking and no one’s going out, this year’s must-have accessory is the pyjama bottom teamed with odd socks.An aerial photograph of Portsmouth taken this week showed that the colour of the sea has turned from the usual mud brown to a shimmering, aquamarine blue.It’s the sort of colour you usually associate with the Caribbean, and it is genuinely amazing.Naturally, green people are saying it happened because the lockdown means less traffic.

If the current measures start to erode, unforeseen dangers could arise.Yet, move too quickly and you risk being blamed for getting it wrong.In some form continuing to isolate without isolation will be necessary, but avoiding great damage to the most disadvantaged children, many of whom are receiving no schooling at all, is vital for our future.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Many studies show women are more focused on building community and teams.They are more likely than men to cultivate a erse set of advisers to help them succeed. They are also more likely to follow advice.A study by management consulting firm McKinsey found that women are more people- orientated and spend more time developing and coaching other leaders in their organisation. In other words, they don’t need to reserve all the glory for themselves.There is something  at play too, though. Female leaders are more likely to be blameddecisions are unpopular or ineffective. They are questioned and second-guessed more often than men.But then Covid- entered the equation and presented world leaders with a new challenge — an invisible enemy that is highly contagious, unpredictable and deadly.This pandemic has been an unprecedented test for all concerned.And guess what  A disproportionate number of those who have passed this test — countries such as Germany, New Zealand, Iceland and Finland — have women at the helm.It is not exclusively female-led countries that are doing well, of course. But bearing in mind only seven per cent of all world leaders are women, about  per cent of countries led by women are doing well when it comes to containing Covid-. Global health experts have concluded that one thing that has led to success in tackling coronavirus is — speed.Prof Tom Bollyky, director of global health programme at US think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “Countries that have not dithered in their response, that have mobilised quickly, have done well.”New Zealand’s PM Jacinda Ardern put it simply: “Go hard and go early.”The number of Covid--related deaths is predicted to be substantially lower in areas where leaders acted sooner, even by a week, because they flattened the curve and prevented new cases.Many women acted first and made the brave decision to shut down le as we knew it, even though that was an unpopular thing to do.But it seems women leaders are listening to World Health Organisation advice and also looking at other countries for guidance.They don’t think they have all the answers but women are able to put their ego to one side and let experts guide them — something which cannot be said of Donald Trump.Incidentally, I have not seen any women leaders making unfounded or dangerous suggestions about possible cures. Can you imagine a woman leader suggesting that people inject Dettol into themselves, as dingbat Trump recently suggested Or can you imagine a woman suggesting to people that they can fight coronavirus and winthey are strong enough This pandemic is not a battle to be fought and won. It is a virus, which can affect literally anyone.No one knows how they will be affected and that bullish “fight it” approach is, in my experience, very male. Conversely, the decision to protect everyone, putting the most at risk first, is more female.It’s interesting that some male leaders seem more interested in covering up the problems. Like Donald Trump, who thinks he is an expert on everything and more fixated on garnering praise for what he has done than fixing and getting right what has not gone so well.I know I am talking in generalisations here but my experience of women is that we want to understand the mistakes and fix them, not cover them up.This pandemic has been full of dficulty and tragedy for everyone.But perhaps one good thing that will come out of it is that the world will acknowledge women deserve an equal  when it comes to leadership.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

In fact, it’s unrecognisable after just six weeks of lockdown.The images show how the usually murky waters of the UK coastline have been transformed, which must surely be due in part to a reduction in pollution since the coronavirus pandemic stopped leisure traffic on the Solent.But other astonishing photos from all over the world have surfaced recently too.Pollution-free images of landmarks in Delhi and Beijing, which are all too often seen shimmering under a haze of smog, are a real reminder of our role in creating pollution and also in reducing it.Imagineanother silver lining to this terrible pandemic was that we all began to understand the effects of our impact on the environment, and that we took the threat of climate change more seriously – and started to take responsibility for changing our ways.I AM as keen as the next person to regain my freedom, and for things to begin toto normal.But I cannot be the only one who gave a shudder at the thought of being allowed to choose a “bubble” of just ten family members as friends, as was hinted at by some.Can you even imagine the disputes, upsets and hurt feelings that would result all over the landyour chosen bubble had chosen another group to huddle with In fact, that rule would likely cause so much offence that we would only have ten friends left. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and they give a terrying insight into how the deadly bug multiplies in the gut.A team from the University of Dundees School of Le Sciences released some of the largest and highest resolution pictures yet recorded of the virus, which has killed over , worldwide.They show the formation of Sars-CoV- particles - the virus causing Covid- - in a tissue model of the human gut viewed in an ultra-powerful microscope.Each of the images is greater than - GBytes – which is  to  times larger than an image recorded on an iPhone.They also show the virus assembling and leaving human intestinal cells.Scientists from the University of Dundees School of Le Sciences worked alongside the Hubrecht Institute in Utrecht, the Erasmus MC University Medical Centre in Rotterdam and Maastricht University in the Netherlands to isolate the pictures.The team, led by Dundee’s Professor of Quantitative Cell Biology, Jason Swedlow, built the Image Data Resource , a publication system for very large, complex images recorded using the worlds most powerful microscopes and imaging systems.Scientists from the team also discovered that Sars-CoV- can infect the cells of the intestine and multiply there.Using state-of-the-art cell culture models of the human intestine, the researchers have successfully grown the virus in test tubes, and monitored the response of the cells to the virus, providing a new cell culture model for its study.These findings could explain the fact that approximately one third of Covid- patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, and the fact that the virus often can be detected in stool samples.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Patients with Covid- show a iety of symptoms associated with respiratory organs - such as coughing, sneezing, shortness of breath, and fever - and the disease is transmitted via tiny droplets that are spread mainly through airborne particles.One third of the patients however also have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and loose stools.On top of this, the virus can be detected in human stools long after the respiratory symptoms have resolved.This suggests that it can also spread via so-called ‘fecal-oral transmission.’Cell biologist Prof Swedlow said: “Were excited to publish these important new datasets in IDR, where they can be seen by researchers around the world, who can also scan the images and view the Sars-CoV- virus up close on their computer.“We have included annotations from the authors so anyone who reads the paper from the research teams in the Netherlands can easily see what the authors published, but also can examine other parts of the data and maybe make their own discoveries.“This kind of sharing of data has never been more important than in our current situation where we urgently need to work together around the world to find out more about this disease and ultimately be able to treat or control it.”Back in March, scientists released images showing the virus erupting out from the surface of human cells which were cultured in a laboratory and taken from a patient in America by the US National Institutes of Health.Scientists scanned the bug which causes Covid- under an electron microscope and colorised the pictures so they could dferentiate the virus to heathy cells.In particular, the scans clearly show the spikes on the outer edge of the virus particles which give coronaviruses their name - as corona means crown or halo in Latin.The scientists also discovered from the scans that the virus that causes Covid- is stable for several hours to days in aerosols and on surfaces.They found that the bug was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, up to  hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.The new disease emerged in China in December and has never been seen in humans before the current outbreak.Its been called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus by the World Health Organisation and causes an illness thats now named Covid-.The new strain is thought to have jumped from bats to humans, via a possible but unknown animal, in the Chinese city of Wuhan.So far, there have been more than , deaths worldwide from the outbreak, while over .million have been confirmed as ill.In the UK alone, the death toll stands at ,, while the number of those diagnosed with Covid- is at over ,.Currently, there is no vaccine to protect people against the virus.Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses -

We will use contact tracing, a well-established public health intervention, to identy the close contacts of those cases, who may have had the disease transmitted to them.“We will ask and support those close contacts to self-isolate, so thatthey do develop the disease, there is less risk that they will pass it on to others.“And we will make sure that support is available to enable people to isolate effectively.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock is expected to unveil the UK Governments own test track and trace programme later today.Chasing down people that new sufferers have mixed with to halt contagion chains has proved hugely successful in countries like South Korea and Germany.Mr Hancock last week announced the NHS is recruiting , contact tracers to do the same in Britain.The Government has come under intense scrutiny over its testing and contact tracing policy after Public Health Englandadvised ministers in early March that contact tracing should be stopped.PHE said in mid-March that because the virus is more widespread and we will not necessarily be able to determine where someone has contracted the virus, contact tracing was being stopped in favour of a more targeted approach.The UK approach has contrasted with other countries such as Singapore and South Korea, which have successfully kept up contact tracing to contain their outbreaks.It comes as the Prime Minister urged Brits to stick with it so the nation could pass the five tests needed to end the lockdown.Speaking this morning, he said: Thank you for all youve been doing to stop the spread of the coronavirus.But we will only be able to move onto the second phase of this conflict when our five tests have been met.These include the NHS having sufficient capacity, a fall in daily deaths, the infection rate falling, PPE being in supply and no risk of a second peak.The PM added: The worst thing we can do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of the coronavirus.Today it was revealed canteens could be closed and masks worn in offices under draft Government plans for the new workplace rules.Brits are facing massive changes when they go back to work as employers are urged to minimise the risk of a second peak.Restrictions being eased will see companies told to minimise the amount of staff using equipment, stagger sht times and maximise home-working.The draft strategy also calls for physical screens and the use of protective equipment when staff cannot work two metres from each other.Staff will also be told to avoid sharing pens and avoid face-to-face meetings."},{"url":null,"title":"glimpse how britains schools look after lockdown germany social distance classrooms","story":"However Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned of a new outbreak risk should people drop their guard and forgot about social distancing.Tenth graders began ing to school last week and elementary school pupils are ing this week.These are the countrys first cautious steps to reopen schools that have been closed since March, as authorities lt lockdown measures that had been imposed to stem the spread of the killer bug.Only students who are close to completing their primary or secondary school this year have been allowed toto classes today, reports Deutsche Welle.Other pupils are expected to follow in the days ahead.

Others with cognitive impairment may not be able to communicate their symptoms.He added that older people may deteriorate before getting care and could be risking the spread of the infection in the community.One doctor in Atlanta said she treated a patient who had a plethora of conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and cognitive impairment.He started to become lethargic and was unable to walk, but didn’t have a cough or fever. Dr Quratulian Syed said the patient didn’t have a fever or cough and was only sneezing on and off. On two occasions paramedics checked him over, on the third occasion he was taken to hospital, where he tested positive for the virus.Heres what to watch out for:Dr Syed said the paramedics had entered the property without the correct PPE and had been put at risk.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Other elderly patients could also display symptoms of trauma, according to Dr Sam Torbati, who said many older people become weak and dehydrated and in some cases have collapsed and injured themselves.He said he has also seen adults who are disorientated, once they are tested it’s discovered that these changes are a central nervous system effect of the virus.This is while doctors in San Francisco and Chicago have also seen patients with symptoms such as nausea, delirium and vomiting, who have then tested positive for the virus.Dr Sylvain Nguyen, a geriatrician at the University of Lausanne Hospital in Switzerland said it was important to gather a list of typical and atypical symptoms for older patients. The atypical list includes symptoms such as, low blood pressure, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea fainting, delirium and fatigue.The data compiled by Dr Nguyen was gathered from reports from hospitals and care homes across Switzerland, France and Italy.Identying such symptoms could prevent the spread of the disease and could also protect key workers from contracting the virus.But one doctor said older people will struggle during this time due to a change in routine.Dr Kathleen Unroe from Indiana University’s School of Medicine said activities have stopped in many care homes, which in turn will make residents weaker. She also added that older people may not be getting as much help as usual when it comes to sorting out their medication.Many may also be struggling mentally with the change, as they are forced to stay away from their loved ones.She added: Someone may be just having a bad day.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Government spokesman said: The Business Secretary continues to work with businesses, union leaders and the science and medical community so we can ensure workplaces are safe for those who will go back to work once the measures are relaxed and give people the confidence toto work. But business leaders said clarity is needed on issues such as personal protective equipmentand whether firms can be held liable eventhey fulfil their obligations to protect employees from coronavirus. Director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce Adam Marshall said the issue is one of the key questions weaposve asked. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Theywill want to know that theyaposre not going to be held liable for horrible things that may unfortunately happentheyaposve done everything in their power to keep their people safe.  Mr Marshall also said there is a need for clear guidance on PPE. No business wants to be competing with the health services or with the care sector, for example, for PPE, he told Today.A UK-wide procurement strategy will be hugely important in order to source and manufacture the necessary PPE, he added. Here, are what the nationaposs workplaces might look like once restrictions are lted. Offices Since the lockdown conditions were first imposed on March , most of the nationaposs office workers have become accustomed to working from home. However, companies that are eager for workers toto the office will need to make a number of changes in order to ensure the health and safety of staff is not compromised. According to the BBC, staggered sht times, less sharing of equipment and continued maximisation of home working are among a number of ideas listed as part of a draft government strategy to help businesses prepare for ato work. Increased hygiene procedures and the installation of protective screens are also included in the plan. Meanwhile, thesays ministers are holding talks with technology firms over the creation of health passports which use coronavirus testing and facial recognition to prove which workers have had Covid-. Retail Last month, the British Retail Consortiumpublished guidance for measures that retail stores could introduce to help with the transition once restrictions are lted. The recommended measures include limiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed. The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores. BRC chief Helen Dickinson said the guidance measures would serve to ensure the safety and well-being of both customers and staff. Since the lockdown, many retailers have proved how shops can be run safely and effectively in line with the Governmentaposs social distancing advice, she said. Continued close collaboration with Government, including public support for the steps retailers are taking and adequate notice to get supply chains up and running, will mean that retail businesses can start trading again slowly and safely, and customers can feel confident that they are safe toto shops. Public transport Public transport is one of the biggest issues for many people as they prepare toto the office. Speaking on BBC Oneaposs The Andrew Marr Show, Transport Secretary Grant Shapp said increased bus and train timetables will be implemented to help the public transport system cope with an influx in passengers while still adhering to social distancing recommendations. The first thing is, obviously, weaposll expand the number of trains and buses running, Mr Shapps said. He also pointed to active transport methods such as cycling as a way for people to take more personal responsibility over their welfare. The second thing to say is active travel, I think, is a very important part of this, by which I mean cycling, walking and so on, he said. Thereaposs been a massive increase ... hundreds of percent more people using the existing scheme where you can go to your employer and ask for a bike which you pay back through the loan and effectively before you pay tax, and thataposs a very popular scheme and I think active transport, active mobility is something weaposve been doing a lot more of.

Hundreds of people are still dying each day from coronavirus. But now that we are past the peak, the government faces pressure to explain how, and when, it will ease up the rules. So over the next week, Boris Johnson is expected to lay out a roadmap for what will happen when the UK does relax the lockdown. He will change very little immediately - and wonapost end the lockdown in one go. But his plan will give us a clearer picture of what the UK will look like over the coming months in a new, coronavirus-scarred world. So what will reopen, what will stay shut - and how will your everyday le change  Weaposve had a look at the main proposals below.The aposroadmapapos explained The important thing to know is just because weaposre getting a aposroadmapapos this week, it doesnapost mean lockdown will end this week. The legal date to review the lockdown is Thursday  May, and Boris Johnson is expected to extend it for another three weeks, possibly with a few minor changes. But the PM will also - separately - announce a roadmap for easing the UK out of lockdown. This is expected later in the week, possibly only on Sunday  May. His plan will make clear that the UK is not ing to business as usual. Some restrictions will be eased, but others - like fines for breaches - will be made harsher than they are now. While people are put back on public transport and in some workplaces, there will be strict social distancing to keep people two metres apart. People are likely to be advised to cover their faces, and will be told to use an NHS phone app that alerts youyouaposve come into close contact with the virus.  When will it all happen  Thereaposs lots of speculation, but no firm date on when lockdown will start to be relaxed. As for when the current rules end completely, that may only be in . What we do know is the roadmap will begin once the aposRapos number - the average number of people infected by each Covid- carrier - is low enough. Currently R is about . because so many people are out of contact with each other. Every time you relax a lockdown rule, R rises again. Ministers say they wonapost do anything that pushes the R number back above . The UK must also pass five tests before easing lockdown:The NHS is able to cope A sustained fall in deaths New infections dropping enough Adequate testing and PPE No risk of a second peak that overwhelms NHSBut Cabinet minister Michael Gove warned: Ultimately, unless and until we have a vaccine, then I suspect we’re going to have to live with some degree of constraint because of the nature of the virus. But we obviously want to, wherever possible, and consistent with our measures on public health, restore people’s lives to as close to normal as possible.    Arriving in the UK Ministers are actively looking at quarantining people who arrive into the UK once lockdown begins to ease. Nothing is confirmed, but reports have suggested people will be asked to isolate themselves for two weeks. If so, this would be a major blow to the airline industry and render most holidays to Britain pointless. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC: I think it’s important... that we ensure the sacrices in the sense of social distancing that we’re asking the British people to make are matched by anybody who comes to this country. So I am actively looking at these issues right now. So that when we have infection rates within the country under control, weaposre not importing. Schools Schools will reopen in a phased way, the government has confirmed - with some pupils going back first while others are told to remain at home. Ministers are looking at the idea of sending dferent year groups back at dferent times. Boris Johnson has signalled he wants primary schools to be the first to , while Walesapos First Minister has suggested Year  could be the very first year group back. Years  and  would then be the first back in secondary schools, according to one plan seen by the Sunday .  Priority could also be put on pupils with special educational needs. The Prime Minister must give schools notice in the next weekhe wants pupils tofrom June  - the first date head teachers have said could be acceptable. Schools say they will need time to put social distancing measures in place to ensure pupils are kept apart. Sources stress there is no final date and June may be put backthe virus is still too widespread. Universities The Sunday Times said at universities, arts students will be the last to , with students of medicine, dentistry and veterinary science prioritised in the autumn. Thirty-three universities are working on a contingency plan to fast-track students of the key sciences back to campus.  Public transport Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the number of trains will slowly rise as lockdown eases, to avoid overcrowding. Hand sanitiser and one-way systems would be placed on the network, with spacing at s and bus stops “clearly marked out” to keep people two metres apart. New timetables will be introduced as planned in May, even though trains will not run to them straight away. Firms would be urged to stagger workersapos start times to spread out the rush out. Meanwhile the government has hinted at more support for Cycle to Work, a tax break scheme where you can buy a bicycle over a year through your employer.  Workplaces and working from home Workplaces would have floor markings to ensure people are two metres apart, according leaked draft guidance. The guidance could also recommend staggered arrival times and breaks, fewer people in lts and regular deep cleaning, according to Sky News and the Sunday Express. However, it seems likely that not all workers would go back to the officethey donapost need to. Government advisors have previously said working from home could become the new normal until thereaposs a vaccine for coronavirus.Supermarkets Supermarkets would doubtless keep many of the social distancing measures theyaposve already put in place. And opening hours could be increased on Sunday to reduce overcrowding. Boris Johnson has said heaposs looking at relaxing Sunday trading laws to reduce queues on the weekend.  Picnics and going outdoors People will be allowed to exercise more than once a day, drive to the countryside and have picnics, according to the Mail on Sunday. Youaposd still have to be with members of your own household only, and keep two metres away from other groups.  No did not comment on the Mailaposs report. But ministers and scientists have repeatedly said outdoor gatherings look to be less risky than those indoors.  Building sites Building sites were never told to close under lockdown guidance - as long as two metres could be kept between workers. So the government is expected to make a renewed push for people toto work there. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said because the transmission rate of the virus outdoors is lower than indoors, there’s “more scope” for some jobs outside. He added: “Thereaposs more scope for people ing to work on building sites for example, or more outdoor leisure activities than is likely to be the case for indoor ones.”  aposBubblesapos of up to  people People could meet small bubbles of their friends and family under one idea to ease the coronavirus lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government was looking at the proposal as one possible way to relax restrictions on peopleaposs movement in the future. But she warnedthe idea does happen, itaposs got to be the same people day-to-day, week-to-week to prevent Covid- being passed on more widely. That means people would have to choose one bubble of friends or family - and stick with them, while continuing not to meet other people they love. Reports later said the idea was one being mulled by the UK government. But itaposs not set in stone.  Fines for breaching lockdown The government is considering raising the penalty for defying lockdown from £ to £ for a first offence. The fines would then double for each offence after that, just as they do already. And the maximum fine would rise from just under £, at the moment to £,. A senior government source did not deny these figures, reported by the Sunday , were under consideration. Covering your face The government hasnapost made a final decision on whether to ask people to cover their face in public. However, some kind of face covering advice is widely expected after Boris Johnson covering oneaposs face in some situations would be a useful tool. Itaposs understood thatface coverings are required, they wonapost be masks. The government doesnapost want to cause a shortage in personal protective equipment that should be available to the NHS. But coverings like a scarf could be recommended. And the government would provide guidance on what kind of material you can make such a covering from. Itaposs important that people donapost end up fiddling with their face covering in a way that means theyaposre actually creating more risk, by continually touching their face. Using a new app A new contact tracing app is expected to launch in around mid-May after trials on the Isle of Wight this week. The app, which is voluntary, will use Bluetooth to track when people have come into close contact with someone who, now or later, tests positive for coronavirus. It will urge someone who’s been in contact with a virus carrier to get tested and to isolate themselvesnecessary. It is part of the crucial “test, track and trace” strategy that is needed before the UK-wide lockdown can be relaxed. The idea is that this would allow society to partially reopen while keeping the virus at bay and sick people in isolation. For it to work properly, at least % or so of the population need to download it. It will be paired with an army of , human contact tracers to follow up on those who need further attention, or those who don’t download the app.  Pubs, grassroots sport, mass gatherings and other venues Pubs will be the last places to reopen as lockdown is eased, the Government has confirmed. Likewise, ministers have indicated that mass gatherings will be among the last things to reopen. But some local cricket and grassroots football could– as long as spectators can stay in the open air. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Jenny Harries said: “Outdoor environments are safer. Butyou go with a load of friends and sit in a pub… that’s not a good thing to do.” And Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told the No coronavirus update: “Transmission is signicantly less outdoors than indoors.” Meanwhile hairdressers and nail bars could remain shut for six months, sources told The Sun. A aposone UKapos approach Scotland and Wales have repeatedly set out plans ahead of, or slightly dferently to, the rest of the UK government. And itaposs true that the Scottish and Welsh governments have control over areas like schools and care homes. However, ministers have also stressed they want to keep the whole of the UK moving in the same way at the same time. And the government has distanced itself from claims that worst-hit regions, like London and the West Midlands, could have dferent rules to the countryside. NHS services Some routine operations and fertility treatment have already been restored as hospital inpatients fall for several weeks in a row. However, itaposs not yet clear when other services - including ENT therapies and dentistry, where staff are particularly at risk of transmission - will continue.

She always has a compact mirror and her lippy, and sheaposs particularly fond of Clarins. She also carries mint lozenges, reading glasses, a fountain pen, and one biographer also claims he once spotted her pulling out a sweetener for her coffee. But there are also a number of sweet additions to her bag, and they are good luck charms. She is said to carry a number of little trinkets her children have given her over the years, including miniature dogs and horses and family photos. One of the photos in her bag is of Prince Andrew, taken after his safefrom the Falklands. As well as looking great and being very practical, the Queenaposs handbags have another purpose - to send messages to her staff and ladies-in-waiting. A sht of the bag from one hand to another is an indication she is ready to move on from whoever she is speaking to.  If she wants to leave an event all together, the Monarch places her handbag on a table. If she canapost use her bag, the Queen uses her wedding ring to send messages to royal officials.

The Prime Minister is expected to explain his roadmap for easing restrictions in an address to the nation on Sunday. But he is not expected to relax the lockdown immediately - as the timing of his speech makes clear. Under current plans, heaposll give his address three days after the lockdown has to be reviewed by law on May . That suggests Mr Johnson will extend the lockdown for another three weeks this Thursday, perhaps with some minor changes, until the end of May. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon today said that, although real and signicant progress was being made, the rate of reproduction of the virus was still too high to alleviate lockdown measures. A review is due to be held on Thursday this week, and the First Minister said it is likely that lockdown measures will continue. She said that some work on a potential transition from lockdown will be published in the coming days. Ms Sturgeon said work would be done to ensure there was alignment with the rest of the UK, but ergence in measures could still be possible. As the UK awaits news later this week, the BBC looked at ways in which other countries have begun to ease lockdown. Schools Many are sceptical about social distancing being possible in schools, but Norway is attempting it. The country has children arriving at staggered times so there is no overcrowding at the gates. Parents are banned from entering the schools so that they do not group. Teachers are then putting the pupils in groups which they must stay in without changing. In France, schools are set to begin to open on May  with masks being compulsory for all students. Class sizes will be kept to  students per class and distance learning will remain free for those students who stay home.  Primary schools in England could be allowed to reopen as soon as June  under possible plans being discussed by Boris Johnson. It is not expected to set out firm dates, but part of that plan is the phased reopening of schools - where ministers confirm some pupils will be sent back first, with others kept at home for longer. Now Mr Johnson appears to have confirmed primary pupils could be the first to . The risk from Covid- is thought to be the lowest in the youngest children. The PM told the Sun on Sunday he wants primary schools reopened as fast as we can adding: Thataposs where we want to go. Itaposs about working out a way to do it.  Bars and restaurants In Lithuania, cafes and bars have opened but with the rule that they can only seat customers outside in terrace areas - and they must also ensure social distance. The mayor of Vilnius is handing over  of the cityaposs squares to hard-hit businesses. Italy and Spain have begun to allow restaurants to be open for take out only in the first phase of reopening.  aposImmunity passportsapos China rolled out an app where peopleaposs health status is being colour coded. In Wuhan, where coronavirus broke out, people are required to show their health status to be allowed on public transport. If their app shows green, they are healthy, but a red status means they should be in isolation. Chile is set to introduce a aposcerticateapos system where a document showssomeone has been infected with Covid- before. The UK is also exploring aposimmunity passportsapos as a way to get people out of lockdownthey have had the disease before. But health experts have warned about concerns over such documents, including the fact medics are still not % surepeople who are infected are definitely immune and how long they would be immune for. Face masks Germany, Taiwan and Poland have seen face mask vending machines popping up in cities. Countries which have made the wearing of a mask when in public mandatory include Venezuela, Vietnam, Slovakia, Columbia, the United Arab Emirates and Cuba. More recently, other countries to follow suit include Austria, Morocco, Turkey, El Salvador, and Qatar, Al Jazeera reports. Britain is reportedly stockpiling face masks to be used on public transport and in shops.  Michael Gove revealed that a domestic effort has been launched to slow the spread of coronavirus by producing masks that limit the droplets that each of us might be responsible for. His commitment comes after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gazumped the UK government in advising Scots to wear masks. Thereports that the government wants to delay an announcement on face coverings until it has stockpiled enough. Phone apps South Korea led on the use of a smart phone app to identyyou are near someone who has tested positive for the virus. Israel is believed to also be taking this approach, as is Australia. The NHS coronavirus app is expected to enter trials on the Isle of Wight from this week. The app is part of the crucial “test, track and trace” strategy that will be crucial in easing the UK-wide lockdown.

The two sides of the busy motorway, which links Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds, separate just before the farm house comes into view, snaking around the property before merging together again a few miles further on. For decades, urban myths have surrounded the white washed building that makes up Stott Hall Farm and the fields around it. The motorway was built in the s and rumour has it that the farmer it belonged to, Ken Wild, had refused to sell it when plans for the six-lane carriage way were approved. It is believed that planners had to come up with way round the problem and decided to simply build the road round it. Ken had been living there with his we, Beth, and their flock of sheep. But rather than being a rebel who was taking a stand against a huge new motorway, it seems that Ken was nothing of the sort. A documentary, filmed almost  years after the motorway was completed, has revealed the truth about why the farm is in the middle of a motorway.

Outside the noise is relentless but inside it’s as peaceful and cosy as any farmhouse. Ken and his we Beth had moved into the farmhouse in  and always insisted the motorway didnapost bother them. Although Beth did admit it made cleaning harder as the sheer number of cars speeding by meant it could get very dusty. Heartbreakingly though, the couple did witness a few fatal crashes while they were living on the farm. But the nearest they came to disaster was .am one morning when a ft lorry ended up overturned in their yard. Beth explained: “The driver climbed out through the windscreen. He wasn’t hurt at all.

John Davies set off for what was meant to be a fun-filled five days at Trecco Bay holiday park in Porthcawl, Wales with fiancée, Eleanor Rees and their son, Maxamus. However, soon after arriving Eleanor began to feel unwell, so the -year-old went to sleep, but never woke up. Now, one year on, John, who lives in Swansea, is speaking out for the first time about the tragedy of losing his partner of six years and bringing up his now three-year-old son on his own. The -year-old army veteran also opened up about how he is now helping others in the community.She was feeling a bit unwell, she suffered with mental health anyway and I gave up work to care for her, John told Wales Online.She was OK going there. She really wanted to go on the trip, she just didnapost want anything to eat. We put it down to her anxiety because she suffered really bad with it. She just wanted to go to sleep so I kept checking on her throughout the night. Then, on Tuesday morning, she didnapost want to get up, she just wanted to sleep. I put my son to bed around .pm and I went to check on her at pm, she was drowsy. John went back to check on Eleanor again to seeshe wanted anything to eat. But he couldnapost get a response.  He said: I turned on the light and I felt her hand and I realised how cold her hand was. I looked at her and she was blue in the face, her hands were going blue. I pulled her off the bed and began CPR when I was ringing the paramedics. I did  minutes of CPR but unfortunately she didnapost pull through it. An inquest into Eleanoraposs death is yet to be concluded. John says getting through the last year has been one of the hardest things he has ever had to face in his le. Itaposs been honestly quite horric the last year but Iaposve got to soldier on. I am ex-forces, he said. Iaposve sort of gone into military training. Iaposve got a three year-old, Iaposve had to keep going for him but itaposs been hard. My world had turned upside down, I lost my fiancée and we had just had a son. He added: When your child goes to bed, just look at them when they are sleeping. That will give you the encouragement to keep going. You can do it, I didnapost think I could to be honest. The army veteran says he always talks to his son, Maxamus, about his mother and that knowing he is the only person his son can rely on keeps him strong. Heaposs starting to ask questions about his mammy now but Iaposve got pictures everywhere around the place, he says. Iaposve got photos on my phone for him and videos of him and his mother when he was really young, we always talk about her. Iaposve got to survive with him. Heaposs doing well, my boy has given me so much strength, he is like a little rock. Itaposs been a bit of a challenge to be honest but it just comes from inside.  Not only does John have to deal with having lost his fiancée and his little boyaposs mum, he also deals with post-traumatic stress disorder from his days in the Army. And has flashbacks from the day Eleanor died. It was pretty bad, he says. I could be playing with my boy and have a flashback of me doing CPR. I get flashbacks from my service time and losing my partner. I get flashbacks from seeing her in the coffin and the noise of her taking her last breath. It can get triggered by seeing paramedics on the television. The flashbacks of me doing CPR are getting less now and more happier times are coming back into my flashbacks, which is a good thing.In the last year, John has decided to volunteer by running a food bank in a drop-in centre and he has set up a project called Menaposs Shed  in Swanseaaposs Blaenymaes which helps men struggling with their mental health.John even won Penderry volunteer of the year in  with Peter Harrison, who is also part of Menaposs Shed. Iaposve been doing some good and Iaposm benefiting from it, I fill my days with volunteering which has been great for me, he says. The thing thataposs been the hardest is going through Christmas, birthdays, the new year, Mothersapos Day then my sonaposs birthday. But itaposs good to to have this voluntary work to escape to. Iaposm doing all this in her name for mental health. My drive is to help people suffering with mental health. Iaposm giving something to the community so I am getting something out of it.

Sadie Inglisapos little boy, Arnie, was five months old when he was was struck ill with Kawasaki disease, which makes the blood vessels throughout the body become inflamed and the heart swell. The little boy from Prestatyn was covered in the telltale rash and spent a week in a hospital in , but his recovery took over a year, his mum told North Wales Live. So far, Kawasaki disease has left at least a dozen children in the UK in intensive care and could be a form of toxic shock. Now Sadie is warning parents of the signs to look out for as doctors find a potential link between the illness and coronavirus. Follow our live blog for the latest coronavirus news and updates  Many of the children showing signs of the syndrome have had  coronavirus, while some have not. Recalling Arnieaposs harrowing experience, Sadie said: “We were in London visiting family when Arnie developed a temperature and a lump on the back of his head. “I took him to Crawley Hospital and he was transferred to East Surrey Hospital straight away. “He was kept in for tests and we were told he had some sort of infection. “His heart rate was fast and his temperature kept on rising. “He also developed an awful rash all over his body including his hands and feet.” Doctors initially said Arnie had an infection in his head that was affecting his heart, his mum said.  The -year-old added: “He was put on antibiotics and a lumbar puncture was done to check for fluid on his brain. He underwent a heart scan and was put on a medication drip. “We were told the infection was around his brain and found he had secondary viral meningitis. “Later on, after more blood tests, they found out he has the Kawasaki disease as well as the secondary viral meningitis. That’s why he was extremely poorly. “I’d never been so terried.” When Arnie was discharged, he remained on medication for a full year afterwards and had to have regular check-ups at Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital. Sadie said: It took a good  months for a full recovery. Arnie is now  months old and has continuous ear infections, tonsillitis as his immune system was so low. Since Arnie was so poorly Iaposve suffered myself with post traumatic stress disorderas it was a very traumatic time for me and Iaposm going through counselling. Hearing about Kawasaki going round at the moment has really hit home, and has worried me for Arnieaposs as well as all other babies childrenaposs sake as I wouldnapost wish it on anyone.  What Iaposd say to parents is you know your own children andyou feel something is not right take them the doctors. Things to look out for are a high temperatures that wont come down with Calpol, a lump at the side of neck, a rash all over the body, cherry red-colour hands, feet, lips and tongue, and also the whites of the eyes go red. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, a case report from the beginning of April has resurfaced, detailing what’s believed to be one of the first-known cases of the virus-related illness, reports  The Mirror. The report explains that a six-month-old girl with the new coronavirus was diagnosed and treated for Kawasaki disease .    In their report, published in  Hospital Paediatrics, the authors wrote: “To our knowledge, this is the first described case of KD with concurrent Covid- infection.” The girl was admitted to hospital with a high fever then after four days started to show signs of Kawasaki disease, including a rash and red eyes. And on day five, she tested positive for Covid-. Now researchers are calling on doctors to be more aware of a possible link between Kawasaki disease and coronavirus. They added: “This case report may serve as a useful reference to other clinicians caring for pediatric patients affected by Covid- as understanding of the clinical presentation patterns continue to evolve. “Further description of the clinical course of pediatric patients diagnosed with Covid- remains necessary, particularly regarding the potential association with KD.”  What is Kawasaki Disease  Kawasaki disease - also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome - is a rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. The characteristic symptoms are a high temperature that lasts for more than five days, with a rash, swollen glands in the neck, dry, cracked lips, red fingers or toes and red eyes.

Experts said it is likely the UK will end up the highest death toll in Europe. Mr Johnson has said that Britain is now past its peak as confirmed cases and deaths trend down. The UK is entering the seventh week of its lockdown, but there are growing calls for the restrictions to be eased. The Prime Minister is expected to reveal a road map next Sunday, detailing exactly how restrictions will be lted in order for Britons to safelyto work. But the Government has also stressed that the nationaposs battle with coronavirus will continue after lockdown measures are eased. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said ministers are trying to source as many masks as possible in case they change the advice to recommend the public wears them. He told Sky News on Monday morning: Itaposs not the amazing thingyou wear a mask that no oneaposs going to get it but there is obviously this issue about human nature and interactionsyou go on public transport and wear a mask will you feel able to go back to work. At the same time, to anticipate should dferent rules be made around masks weaposre trying to source as many masks as possible as we speak and have been for the last few weeks. Mr Wallace said the public arenapost stupid when asked about hesitancy toto work when the lockdown is eased after weeks of strict stay-at-home messaging. He said: I strongly believe the public arenapost stupid. They read advice, they listen to the media. They took on board the Governmentaposs advice... and I think they will be perfectly able to read the Governmentaposs next stage when we get to it. Iaposm totally confident when it comes to the next step we will all together be able to move forward.  Mr Wallace suggested the two-metre distancing rule could be relaxed to allow people to go back to work. He added: You can look at shielding, you can look at how long you stay near people. The two-metre rule reduces the possibility of infection by a certain amount of time. If you halve that it still keeps people away from being infected but for a lesser time. The probability of being infected is much less. I think there are options about how we can do it. You can wear PPE, that could be a possibilityyou have to be in close proximity or indeed you could find other ways of doing it.

From garish colour schemes to drab interiors, itaposs clear that people have very ied options on what a home should look like. And it can be part of the fun, decorating your home and ripping out horrendous choices by previous owners.  And now a semi-detached house on the Isle of Harris in the Western Isles, Scotland, has left house hunters baffled and amused after a look inside. The £, three bedroom holiday cottage caused a stir online after being put up for sale on Rightmove. Images available online show the cosy looking house and the descriptions hints at the art deco detail that gives the house much character. A living room overlooking the sea loch on the rural island is filled with cosy details and colourful five foot  either side of the windows. But a second look at the picture hints that something very unexpected is set to come. If you focus on the kitchen, you can see some unusual decoration is about to come. And the next image shows the amazingly unusual decoration youaposd be living with every day.  Personally Iaposd not be able to relax due to always expecting a spoon to land on my head whilst I stir my pasta. And amid lockdown, thereaposs a lot of time spent in the kitchen cooking pasta. The unusual decoration has also crossed over on to the floor, just for extra confusion.  Itaposs fair to say that the artwork has ided people. One woman wrote: Very much enjoying this completely normal decor on the Isle of Harris on Rightmove. Another joked: Thataposs a scene from Inception, right. A third person added: I donapost know what they put in their tea, but spilling it on the floor is obviously not a good idea.  And one person asked the question many people were thinking: Why would anyone do that  They could fall off and land on your head. Another helpfully suggested the estate agents should add: Features nightly redecoration by poltergeists to the property description. One tweet said: Yikes! Do the particulars mention it at all  “Needs cosmetic improvement” “one quirky previous owner” But one fan defended the decoration - pointing out the potential lack of things to do on an isolated Scottish island in the Outer Hebrides. She wrote: Given enough spoons, enough glue, and nothing but sea and sky for alternatives, youaposd do it too, wouldaposncha  Online, the property description states: Kilda House was built by Lord Leverhulme in  as the original Doctors House.  It has been extensively refurbished and insulated to a high standard by the current owners. The inner doors are the original  doors and their art deco details set the style that gives the house its character, much loved by the regular guests. Professional artist Suzan Visser has used three- dimensional ‘trompe d’oeil’ painting techniques throughout on furniture, fireplaces and floors to great effect. On either side of the picture window overlooking the sea loch are a pair of stunning  foot tall ‘Moe¨t et Chandon’  paintings done in the Mucha style by Suzan, which are included with the property. Moving on through the house, many people were also taken by the bespoke beach themed decorated floor in the bathroom.  The sandy interior wasnapost for everyone with one unkind person writing: It looks like it needs a good sweeping. The colourful home doesnapost disappoint as you make your way virtually through the house.As one pun fan wrote on Twitter : It really bowls me over. Not something I would usually anticiplate! The rest of the house features other artistic details such as painted fireplaces and another painted bathroom floor. As one person joked: This is very mid aposs Changing Rooms. I keep expecting Carol Smiley to walk through the door and then one of the homeowners to burst in to tears.

Now these birds, which spend hours perched on a lookout before soaring to high altitudes, have made a comeback of late. Also known as the fish eagle, they are the UK’s largest bird of prey with a wingspan of up to . metres. They became extinct here early in the th century due to illegal killing. But thanks to Forestry England and the Roy Dennis Wildle Foundation, who are leading a project to reintroduce them, releasing a group on the Isle of Wight last year, they may become a more frequent sighting in the skies near you.They are currently GPS tracking four young birds making their first big trips. During winter, they were ­sedentary, but with better weather they have flown from their nests to Somerset, Kent and Norfolk. Two brave birds, G and G, have flown up as far north as Yorkshireto roost.Campaigners are appealing to people for sightings and photos. The birds have black-ridged tails, a hooked yellow beak and golden eyes with yellow legs and talons. Evidence from the ­Netherlands, where there is a small but growing ­population of white-tailed eagles, shows that the species will readily nest in densely populated areas, close to people. As a generalist predator, an animal that thrives in a wide iety of environments and scavenges on dead animals, white-tailed eagles favour fish in spring summer, with water birds in autumn winter, but also take rabbits and hares.

The four-bedroom home in Louisiana, US, was built in the s and has gained a spooky reputation, meaning no one has dared to move in despite not having to spend a penny to make it theirs. One former resident claims the home is haunted by her great grandmother, who is aposwell knownapos to stir cooking left unattended in the kitchen and move the pots around.Sylvia McLain, a co-owner of McLain Investments, took to Facebook to share snaps of the home in a bid to convince someone to move and restore the home so they could build new property on the land.However, it appears potential suitors were put off by a flood of comments below from ex-residents and visitors who reported the creepy goings-on they claim to have experienced. Sylvia admitted sheaposs heard aposall the storiesapos about it being haunted by an old woman and said former owners had even had ghost hunters in to banish her. But she remains hopeful the aposhistory of the homeapos can be saved, and itaposs free for anyone to take on to aposmove to another location for restorationapos. Former resident Dawn Vallot DeClout claims the house is occupied by the spirit of her great grandmother Adele, a ft in woman who lived until about  and was known for meddling in the kitchen. Dawnaposs family owned the -acre plot the house was built on from , and her great grandmother died in the front room in .  Dawn, whose family moved out in the s, said: We believe [Adele] is the ghost, but sheaposs not menacing at all. She was probably like ft in and weighed about lb. She lived to be almost  and she was always digging in the pots, like when you have something on the stove and someone goes and looks in the pot and stirs it around. She was well-known for that, and so when we lived there, we used to hear her all the time jangling the pots when we had something on the stove. You could hear somebody picking up the lid but there was nobody in the kitchen.  Sylvia said there is a lot of rumours surrounding the house, with apossome really cute stories about it being hauntedapos. One suitor had offered to take the home, but had a change of heart when they discovered it would cost about £, to move and reassemble.  Sylvia believesthe two-storey, , square foot property was kept close by, it would only cost about half of that. However, locals comparing it to a notorious house in Amityville, where a man shot and killed six members of his family, isnapost making it any easier.  The post on Facebook got hundreds of responses with one writing: Yes it is [haunted]. I experienced three things there that could not be explained and my friend that lived there had more than that. We actually experienced one together and we still talk about it. Another replied: Most likely the haunting will stay attached to the land and whoever lives in the new home they build will deal with it.

In just a matter of months, the pandemic has spread throughout the world, with families left heartbroken as loved ones die alone in ICUs and makesht wards. Economies are being brought to their knees with businesses shut and employment soaring, all while key workers continue to lose their lives on the frontline. The first death was reported on January  in Wuhan, China, after the virus emerged there in December, before quickly spreading to Europe by February. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  The unprecedented death tolls mean scores of dead bodies are being stored in refrigerated trucks in New York, mass graves are being dug at a cemetery in London and many around the world are being prevented from attending the funerals of those dearest to them. North America and European countries accounted for most of the new cases reported in recent days, but numbers were rising from smaller bases in Latin America, Africa and Russia. Globally, there have been , new cases over the past  hours, according to a Reuters tally that is based on official government data.  The loosening of restrictions in countries, including across at least half of the US, has proved controversial, as experts debate the best strategy to ensure there is no large second wave outbreak. Health officials have also expressed concern about the rising case numbers in countries where there is a shortage of testing and a lack of medical facilities.While the number of new cases has come off a peak of , reported in a single day last week, it is still at around , to , cases per day globally. Below is a summary of the situation in five of the hardest hit countries, including tolls and current position in terms of lockdown and easing. USA  In the United States, around half the countryaposs state governors ramped up the re-opening their economies over the weekend, while others, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, declared the move was premature. Over the past fortnight, several states had already started easing restrictions by opening stores, restaurants and other public spaces, despite federal guidelines calling for the number of cases to fall for  straight days before relaxing lockdown measures. Texas began lting restrictions on Friday despite reporting a single-day high in deaths.  Stores, restaurants, movie theaters, malls, museums and libraries were allowed to reopen but with limited occupancy - just  per cent of their capacity. The United States, with the worldaposs third-largest population, has five times as many cases as the next hardest-hit countries. It has so far recorded ,, cases of Covid- and , deaths. Spain  Over the weekend in Spain many ventured outside for the first time since the countryaposs lockdown began March  but social distancing rules remained in place and masks will be mandatory on public transport. Spaniards were yesterday revelling in a second day of freedom, heading outside in time-slots for age groups. Though Spainaposs appalling COVID- outbreak has shrouded the nation in mourning for more than , dead, there was much-needed relief on a sunny spring day as people at last headed back to the streets, hills and sea.  Joggers ruled the streets early on, before it was the elderly and then childrenaposs turn - all under orders to stay two metres apart under continued social distancing guidelines. One of the worst-hit nations, Spainaposs death toll climbed by  in the previous  hours to ,, while cases reached ,, according to latest health ministry data on Sunday. But the declining pace of deaths and infections has led Spain to start unwinding its stay-at-home order, with children allowed out under supervision from last weekend, and adults given permission to exercise outdoors from Saturday. Italy Italy is set to ease its lockdown on Tuesday and open bars and restaurants again in June after seven weeks of shutdown to curb  coronavirus.Seen as Britainaposs blueprint with an outbreak two weeks ahead of the UK, Italy will allow factories and building sites to reopen a week today and permit limited family visits. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte laid out his plan to end the lockdown last weekend, more than two months after the first case of COVID- appeared in a small town outside Milan.  Following weeks of lockdown and more than , deaths, Italy is looking ahead to a second phase of the crisis in which it will attempt to restart the economy without triggering a new wave of infections. Italyaposs official case number sits at , and its death toll is ,. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who battled COVID- last month, said on Sunday the country was over the peak but it was still too early to relax lockdown measures, which will likely remain until June.Mr Johnson is expected to unveil his roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions next Sunday, but is not expected to set firm dates. He is, however, likely to confirm the phased reopening of schools, while businesses and trade unions have been sent guidelines for how to make workplaces safe for ing staff. Current Government advice is for over-s, even without an underlying health conditions to be ‘particularly stringent’ in following lockdown rules. The PM has also said the government is looking at relaxing laws restricting supermarket opening hours.At yesterdayaposs briefing, Minister for the Cabinet Michael Gove confirmed , people have died with coronavirus in the UK - a rise of  on the day before, the smallest for weeks. The UK has , confirmed cases.France  Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said last week the country must learn to live with the virus, as he laid out plans to lt lockdown and stave off economic collapse. Secondary schools will reopen on May  with masks being compulsory for all students. Shops will also be allowed to open their doors once again but pubs and restaurants will remain closed.

The Queen was believed to have a personal furtune of £million in  with the majority of the British monarchyaposs wealth coming from inherited land and investments. This is in addition to the sovereign grant to pay for the royal familyaposs expenses, which comes from taxpayers. But that wealth pales in comparision to the coffers of the House of Saud, the ruling family in Saudi Arabia. The monarchy is said to worth more than £TRILLION - more than  times the wealth of the British royal family. And with that amount of cash, the royal family expect only the best. Private jets, luxury superyachts, helicopters, palaces, luxury chateaus, gold furniture in their lavish homes - and even a gold-plated tissue dispenser. Among one of the biggest spenders in the royal family is Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. On one wall in one of his Saudi Arabian royal palaces hangs a Leonardo Da Vinci painting worth £million. The crown prince, who is heir to the throne, is also said to have bought a £million superyacht, £million chateau in France, two homes in London and an entire compound on the southern coast of Spain. As deputy prime minister - his father King Salman is Prime Minister - the crown prince is said to be the power behind the throne. Along with his massive spending, he has also made some important cultural changes to Saudi Arabia, including removing the ban on women being able to drive. But with a personal fortune of almost £.billion he can certainly afford to splash the cash. Unlike the British royal family, the Saudi monarchy hasnapost gained its wealth from land - instead their vast fortune comes from the huge oil reserves in the Middle Eastern country. The crown prince also seems to have turned his attention to acquiring a football club and is believed to be heading a consortium who wants to buy Newcastle United. However, he refuses to be drawn on how large his vast wealth actually is.  In an interview with  CBS News, the Crown Prince insisted that his finances were a private matter.He added: I’m a rich person and not a poor person. I’m not Gandhi or Mandela. I’m a member of the ruling family that existed for hundreds of years before the founding of Saudi Arabia. His father the king, who came to throne in , is believed to have a personal fortune of £.billion. One of the wealthiest members of the Saudi royal family is Prince Alwaleed, who was said to have a fortune of £billion and was the th richest man in the world. But then he was arrested under the orders of the crown prince. He was one of the three members of the royal family to be arrested in November  as part of an anti-corruption drive by the government. He was freed a few months later and is believed to have made a financial settlement and fallen out of the Forbes rich lists. However, the prince still owns a huge superyacht which was used in the James Bond film, Never Say Never Again. He also has but a mere two palaces with a third currently being built. The Kingdom Palace is the residence the prince calls his main home. Worth £million the sand-coloured palace boasts  rooms, five kitchens, including one solely for desserts, a lagoon-shaped pool and a -seat cinema. In addition , tonnes of Italian marble were used in the palaceaposs construction and the floors are covered in silk oriental carpets. And thereaposs no chance of the prince ever getting bored when heaposs at home as the palace has  TVs. As well as his lavish palaces, Prince Alwaleed also owns the Kingdon Resort, which has three lakes and huge gardens. His third palace, which will be called Kingdom Oasis, will have its own private zoo. However, despite their lavish spending the Saudi royal family insist they plough billions into charitable projects every year. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has set up his own charitable organisation, Alwaleed Philanthropies, which he has given billions to. He said: Philanthropy is a personal responsibility, which I embarked upon more than three decades ago and is an intrinsic part of my Islamic faith. And when King Salman came to throne one of his first acts was to donate £billion to ordinary Saudi people.

The video, which has been shared on social media, shows a huge flock of sheep passing through the coastal town of Samsun. Ragip Soylu, a reporter for Middle East Eye posted the video on Twitter, which shows the farm animals quickly making their way through empty streets, with some taking a rest on the grass. Mr Soylu tweeted: Flock of sheep invades Turkey’s city of Samsun last night during the coronavirus lockdown. There were similar scenes closer to home in March, when a group of goats took over a Welsh town. A herd of goats were spotted running wild in the seaside town of Llandudno in north Wales. The naughty animals were first spotted on March , outside a pub near Trinity Square, where they began eating hedges. Video journalist Andrew Stuart filmed their antics and ended up calling the police to let them know of the amusing goings on outside his window. And despite being chased by a police car in the middle of the night, the goats were still taking over the town.  Meanwhile, the number of people who have died from Covid- in Turkey rose by  on Sunday, taking the total to ,. The overall number of cases rose by , to ,, which is the highest total outside Western Europe, the United States and Russia. Turkey recently extended the shutdown of its schools until the end of May amid the coronavirus pandemic. Education minister Ziya Selcuk said that the remote schooling system through television broadcasts and the internet would continue until May .Turkey closed down schools across the country on March , a day after it reported its first confirmed Covid- infection.Elsewhere, Turkey has plans to introduce a certicate for Brits to prove they donapost have coronavirus in order to be allowed to visit.  Turkey’s Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy said the normalisation phase in Turkey could begin as early as the second week of May. He told local media that holidaymakers will need an official document detailing their health status while new measures are also to be introduced across the tourism industry.

For me, the club was on its knees.“Not financially or anything like that but morale, the place was at rock bottom.“Everybody was trying to do everything to liven the place up and get us going and get it back to being a happy place for people to come to work.“I think now we are back in a situation where everybody feels part of it. At the minute it is a really good professional environment but there is more we can do to get better.”Despite taking caretaker charge of the final match of the previous season at home to St Mirren, McPake admits his first game as full-time boss at Raith Rovers, a - win in the Betfred Cup, was a big moment.“I was very nervous. It was my first real taste ofmy team – the St Mirren game wasn’t my team,” he said.“This was my first game, our new team’s first game and a lot of new ideas had went into that pre-season.“I was very nervous and probably only settled when the third goal went in.”The Dens boss would go on to miss a home stalemate with Peterhead a week later due to the birth of his daughter.Although it was tough to have to watch from afar, McPake knew he’d left the team in good hands with assistant Jimmy Nicholl and first-team coach Dave Mackay.“I watched the full game from the labour suite,” revealed McPake.“It wasn’t too dficult in the sense that I wasn’t there because, I’ll be honest, family is everything – whether it was a Dundee United game or anything, I was going to be at the birth of my child.“My worry was the baby would arrive when we were up at Coveand I would struggle to be there.“I watched the Peterhead game and I did try to get messages across to the staff, without being too intrusive.“We had picked the team before and for me to be texting from a labour ward and they are seeing the game in real time would’ve been wrong.“The messages I sent were very simple and we had Jimmy Nicholl # he’s played in two World Cups, managed a team that’s won our league and managed a team to a major trophy # and Dave Mackay had managed against teams in that league so we were in capable hands.“We just weren’t good enough on the day, simple as that, and were very flat. That gave us an early indication of what was to come – teams just came, let us have the ball and sit in.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee fc john nelms lifts lid spfl vote u turn","story":"Ever since his deciding ballot ended the lower-league season, John Nelms has been cast, by some, as a sinner in the SPFL vote saga.The Dens Park supremo was front and centre of the crisis that engulfed Scottish football this month after his ‘no’ vote failed to reach the SPFL’s email account and left him with the fate of the game in his hands.Five days later, he switched Dundee’s vote to a ‘yes’, passing the resolution that ended the   campaign in the bottom three isions.Speculation over what sparked Nelms’ change of heart has raged ever since, but the Dundee chief has remained silent.Until today.Finally, in a sit down interview with Tele Sport, Nelms has lted the lid on the events of the last month, and on his hopes for Scottish football’s future – and we are giving his story to you exactly as he gave it to us.George Cran: You stated at the start you were going to vote ‘no’ to the SPFL’s resolution, what were your thoughts on it to begin with John Nelms: From the beginning, I didn’t want anything to go out that would hurt anybody at all. We had very limited time to look at things. The document itself didn’t give much hope for reconstruction and didn’t do a lot of things. For me, I wasn’t just thinking of Dundee Football Club but other clubs who would be hurt in all of this. That was my main focus – I didn’t want anybody to get hurt.The change came after a lot of conversations with a lot of clubs and the appetite for reconstruction was greater than I first thought. There are other things, which I don’t want to get into, but we were trying to help these clubs who were going to be hurting. I was trying to soften the blow for everybody but also trying to use the time [between the deadline and submitting the ‘yes’ vote] to make Scottish football, through reconstruction, a better overall product that has more value going forward. That’s something we have been discussing for a long time, but we have the time now to really dig in and look at it. Getting to that stage, we had over % of the clubs vote a certain way so, in order to get going, so to speak, I changed my vote so we could get on to the next phase.As far as the Premiership goes, all we did was vote to put it into the hands of the board. They now have in their hands the chance to say what they want to do with it. They can try to play [the remaining matches] later. There are options they will have to weigh. We weren’t weighing those options.GC: What went through your mind when you saw the incomplete vote had been published JN: I wasn’t best pleased. I know there was a statement saying: “We had to put something out because we had a board meeting,” but the statement could have been as simple as: “We have an incomplete vote, there is a statutory  days and we have not received every vote.” By the way, it wasn’t just our vote, there were others that weren’t received either. They could have said it was an incomplete vote without any detail and that would have been more appropriate in my opinion.GC: At that point, you have said you weren’t aware it was your vote that was missing, what did you think then JN: I don’t know what happened, I have no idea. What they say is it got caught in the spam folder, which you have to believe. We did intend to vote a certain way and then changed it after I had more information. I talked with a lot of people. I pace when I talk on the phone. The Saturday, I walked . miles while on the phone, mostly inside my house. I averaged over the period before I voted over  miles a day, just on the phone.GC: What was the major part of changing your vote JN: The biggest thing was, the only way I could see, once we knew what was happening, that we could help anybody – it’s not just helping people but a longer-term, bigger picture – is reconstruction. Speaking with a lot of clubs, there was much more of an appetite for reconstruction than I understood going into this. That was the main thing.GC: Can you understand why other people saw Dundee as the bad guy JN: Obviously, people think we have handed United the league, Rangers think we have handed Celtic the league, although that is in the hands of the board, which they have a representative on. Over % voted for it and it was going to happen one way or the other – we represent % of that vote, total. The only way going forward would be league reconstruction. Yeah, I can see why I am the bad guy, but  or % of the league are also that same bad guy. The league did, in putting it out there, put us in a bad position.GC: The WhatsApp messages . Did that influence your thought process JN: It’s unbelievable. The way that was handled was not businesslike and was very poor. It has caused a lot of bad blood throughout the league, the way that was done, taking private messages and putting them out there. Of course, they have been taken out of context at some levels because you don’t know exactly what was going on and what the conversations were. There were a lot of conversations going on at that time, loads of them, so you don’t get the full context of it but you do get one view and that’s what they wanted.GC: You mentioned ‘handing’ Dundee United the Championship. Did that come into the thinking at any point JN: Obviously as Dundee Football Club, we don’t want to hand our rivals anything but, at the end of the day, it was inevitable that was going to happen. I had several conversations with Mal [Brannigan, Dundee United managing director] throughout this, several conversations with Rangers, with Celtic, with Hearts, I’ve had conversations with quite a few people. You could tell early on that there would be promotion relegation and there was no way around it because over % of the clubs wanted that to happen. Whether or not we wanted that to happen, it was going to happen. I’m not going to make a decision based on what happens to United – I have to make the decision on what’s best for Dundee Football Club and what’s best for Scottish football.GC: To make it clear, what was the benefit to Dundee in changing your vote JN: We were in the worst position possible – we were in third place. There’s not much benefit one way or the other that we could get out of this. When people ask me that – I ask what do you think we could we have gotten out of this  So, the best thing we could possibly get out of this is a proper conversation about reconstruction. That might not benefit us in the short-term, but in the long-term, it would benefit Dundee FC and all of Scottish football. That, for me, was the best thing we could get out of this. Does that do anything for us right now  No. But we need to look at it in a much bigger, broader picture as opposed to: “What does it do for me right now ”GC: After the whole process, are you happy with the end result JN: I’m not happy with the overall process, I’m not happy with where we are, I’m not happy football clubs are losing money, I’m certainly not happy people are dying of coronavirus in the wider world. We still don’t know what is actually going to happen. All of this might be for nought, we might be shut down for a long, long time and be having much dferent conversations in the future. You can never be happy in these situations, just be pragmatic and get through it as best as we can.GC: Are you confident reconstruction is going to happen and benefit the game in the long-term JN: We are having good conversations. We have to jump through a load of hoops and we have  clubs we have to satisfy, on some level. For me, the most important thing in this is that Scottish football – and, in turn, Dundee Football Club – comes out with a product that is better than we currently have. Sky Sports and our media partners need to be a part of this, too, and help us understand exactly what it is going to take in order for us to be a more attractive product, a more saleable product. We want to be on TV, we want more people to come to games, we need to make games have more meaning, we have to do things that might be outside of the box to bring viewers to the table – that’s the angle I come at it from. I can’t talk to you about the specics of what the group is talking about because we are trying to work through all of these things but the principle, from my point of view, is we have to absolutely make it a more attractive proposition for fans and for viewers. There are ways of doing it.What I want to get out of it all is a product that is better that, in turn, brings more money in that, in turn, makes the product even better and it turns full circle. For me, that’s the goal. It’s a long-term vision but we have the time right now to pay attention to that and work through these things. It might end up this scenario ends up being a change-stage process, whenever we get started again, for  , and then reconstruction might start in  .GC: Do you have a preference for which way the league might be set up JN: I really can’t talk about that because of the [reconstruction working] group I am in. A lot of the setups have merits, a lot have issues but as long as whatever format is setup makes it more valuable, more interesting, then I would be open to just about any type of system. At the end of the day, the top tier brings in the most money and that’s where the eyes are but we have to be conscious of down the leagues, they rely more on gate than TV money, and we have to make sure those games are maintained or even enhanced in some way. It is a balancing act, it’s not as simple as just I like this one or that one.GC: How confident are you we might get consensus at the end of this JN: I don’t know. We have only had two meetings so far. There has been a lot of work gone into those meetings. I thinkwe get to a proposition where all clubs benefit financially, the pie actually grows rather than just cutting it up in dferent ways, you’d have a better chance of getting a consensus. If the goal makes the product better and eventually the product is worth more, that makes more sense –you just change for the sake of it, it doesn’t make much sense to me.GC: Do you see it being better to make a permanent change or a temporary one like was suggested in Hearts’ first statement after the reconstruction talks were announced JN: I don’t know, that’s the problem. I don’t think it’s as simple as we can make one big change right away. I think it might be something that phases in over time. But like I said, we have to have all the stakeholders talking in order to see what that means. We have to make sure all the contracts are being satisfied and these conversations take time. It might be that we have a staged-process but at this point, we are so early in the process, I don’t know what that would % look like. We are still working through all the iterations.GC: Getting all the stakeholders talking – has that been made more dficult by the way things have happened over the past few weeks JN: I think within the group, it’s been fine. Everybody is professional. Honestly, there has been no animosity on the phone calls. Any time we run through anything like this, tensions run high and people say things and do things. For the most part, it’s just business and forgivable and off you go. There may have been one or two things that were done that will be more dficult for people to let go but, hopefully, we can all focus for the proper greater good of the game. If we have a proposition that is best for everybody, I would hope we look at the proposition and not really consider anything ."},{"url":null,"title":"fan reaction spfl vote u turn john nelms","story":"John Nelms says he understands the frustrations of Dundee fans after his voting U-turn saw Dundee United crowned Championship winners # but insists the decision was “for the best of the football club”.And he’s thanked “amazing” supporters who have already spent their hard-earned money on a season ticket for the next campaign despite not knowing when it will start or what it might look like.The Dens Park managing director was at the centre of the voting storm that engulfed Scottish football last month as the Dark Blues’ deciding vote swung from a ‘no’ to a ‘yes’ and allowed the SPFL’s resolution to end the   season in the lower leagues to pass.It also granted rivals United the league title and promotion to the Premiership. After an unclear club statement that later emerged to be Dundee’s notice of submitting a ‘yes’ vote, some Dark Blues fans reacted angrily to the decision.Askedhe understood the feelings of the supporters, Nelms told the Tele: “Absolutely. I don’t ever really say which way I vote, I give principles of what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.“The last daywe did a holding statement saying we’re not going to make a statement until we actually do something and then the next statement came out because we actually did something and voted.“But, people didn’t realise that we actually voted. So, we had to put out another statement.“You know how I am, I don’t talk about players# contracts, I don’t do things like that because I don’t think it’s appropriate at the time because you are negotiating. You can’t do that in the public eye because it’s not beneficial for the football clubyou do it that way.“We talked about it and I could see why the fans were concerned.“Honestly, I’m not surethe fans can see it or not but we are doing whatever we can do for the best of the football club, always. Not once in a while, not when it suits, always.“We will make decisions that might not be popular among the fans in the short-term but overall in the long-term it will benefit the football club. That’s the way we will run the business and I don’t think we’ve done anything but that. I’ll take the heat for it and that comes with the territory.”The club haven’t had any match income for over seven weeks due to the coronavirus shutdown.Nelms says Dundee are in a “stable position” but accepts there is no way of knowing what the future might hold.“At the moment, the way we have the business set up, with insurances and the way the“It is a new reality. Our business has changed from getting excited and ready for the next match to basically survival.“We are trying to prepare for when we come out of this but we don’t really know what is going to happen – we have nine dferent budget options for next year.“We don’t know when we are going to start playing again and that is the hard, frustrating part of it all.”Asked how much the club is losing per month, Nelms replied: “This is one of these things where I won’t talk about specic numbers.“Every club is going to be dferent – most clubs don’t have the insurance policies we have in place so they will be losing more than we will.“The government has really stepped in and helped out the mid-sized to lower-end clubs.“At the bigger clubs with the salaries the players are on, although the furlough helps, it doesn’t help a huge amount.“I would say Dundee Football Club and others around the size of our club are at a pucker point where it really helps us out and it helps out clubs below us but above it won’t help out as much.“We’re OK at the moment but we don’t know what is going to happen.”Despite not knowing when the next campaign will be, fans have already been putting money into the club by buying season tickets for  .An “amazing” gesture says Nelms.“You can’t thank people enough in a day and age like this where every day you are living basically day-to-day to see people step up and buy season tickets is amazing,” he added.“It’s incredible to see the number of people who have bought them with a big unknown going forward.“We will be playing football at some point in time, we just don’t know exactly when.“The fact they have faith in the club and desperately want to see their team is helpful – and also helps us build the team based on the support we have.“We know there are things that are way more important now than football butpeople want to dig in their pockets then great,not we’ll see you when we are all back together and have a good product on the park.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.15128408-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.15128408-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.15128408-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.15128408-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"the feelgood feed stories to lift your day","story":"Things are tough right now — but the power of community has never been more important or more obvious.In every walk of le, people are coming together to ensure that no one is left to fight coronavirus alone.

We are part of a big movement which has always worked to give back to the local community.“As a group we’re always looking to try and help so we had a think about what we could do.“We usually take Santa and the sleigh out at Christmas, which helps to spread some cheer. We figured it would be a fun idea to try to take him out to lt spirits during this dficult time, so Santa will be wearing his Hawaiian shirt, shorts and flip flops during his visit.“We’ve asked the public to put non-perishable items in a carrier bag and put it at the end of their driveway or the bottom of their garden path. We’ll then come around and collect them.”Donations collected during the visit will go directly towards The Trussell Trust and local churches in Ellon.Ellon residents will be able to track Santa’s progress via GPS, which will be made available nearer the time.George added: “This is the first time we’ve ever had an event this early, but usually we get a big response in the winter time. We raised just shy of £, last Christmas. We collect cash, knock on doors, hand out sweets and normally have a chat with people at their doors.“Obviously, given the current circumstances, we’ve had to make some changes.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering key workers in inveraray","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsInveraray#s war memorial was lit up blue this week in tribute to the work being done by NHS staff and other key workers during the coronavirus crisis.The tribute was organised by Inveraray#s branch of the Royal British Legion Scotland.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions.

Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

The Scottish and UK governments have already made it clear they see no major change to the current rules, so you may wonder what room there is for speculation. Acres and acres of it is the answer. With very little  on the news agenda other than coronavirus all those broadcasting hours must be filled somehow.The Sunday papers helped with the speculation game by sending lots of hares running about what le might be like once restrictions are lted. For a start, there are likely to be lots more queues, this time to get on a bus or train.As it turned out, the Minister for the Sunday shows was Grant Shapps, UK Transport Secretary and a man best placed to talk about such matters. Or so you might think.There are certain rules in the speculation game to which all players must adhere. On journalistsrsquo part this involves beginning a question by saying you donrsquot expect AN Other minister to give a precise answer, then asking them to do just that. A questioner might say, for example. ldquoI know you canrsquot tell usschools are going to be back in June, but are schools going to be back in June Since there is only so much of this a viewer can tolerate, the Sunday shows broadened their offerings by talking to a wider range of guests than in previous weeks.The Andrew Marr Show has always dipped its toes in the arts as well as politics, and yesterday the presenter spoke to former Python turned world traveller Michael Palin, and the actor Eddie Marsan, about le during lockdown.Michael Palin is among the contributors to a new book, Dear NHS. Adam Kay, author of This is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor, had the idea of asking famous names to write a letter of thanks to the NHS, with money from sales going to charity.The former Python said being in lockdown felt like ldquoenforced retirement and he was rather enjoying having an empty diary.Marr asked how travel might change for everyone in a post-virus world.ldquoYou can travel less and travel better, said Palin. ldquoIf we have to be confined to travelling the UK it is not a bad place to travel. Go to places and learn more about them, enjoy them more. Find out more about your own country.ldquoIt is going to be very dficult for people right across the world to travel again as they did before. Until they find a vaccine nobody is going to pack people into aeroplanes. Therersquos going to be no cheap and cheerful flights around the world.Palin was also asked about the possibility of people over  being told to stay in lockdown longer than younger groups.ldquoItrsquos a dficult call every time but yoursquove got to be more selective here, because there are a great deal, a great number, of people in their s who are very active, very thoughtful, whorsquove got lots of ideas, can contribute to our recovery.ldquoTo treat them all as people who have to be sort of kept out of sight is going to be very dficult and very wrong and very unfair on a lot of people who want to help.On Ridge on Sunday, Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, was similarly critical of ldquoage discrimination against the over s.ldquoItrsquos not OK to discriminate on grounds of gender, or obesity, or colour of skin, but everybody is saying, letrsquos think about somehow discriminating on the basis of age, she said.ldquoThis idea that just because someone is old that they are frail, theyrsquore vulnerable, they are not fit or they are not worthy of the same treatment as other age groups is utterly wrong.The travel industry is not the only business going through major changes, as Marrrsquos interview with actor Eddie Marsan showed.The star of Happy-Go-Lucky and  Grams can be seen on television later this week in one of ITVrsquos ldquoIsolation Stories, a series of short, -minute dramas filmed in actorsrsquo own homes by their families. The idea came from Jeff Pope, the writer of Philomena and Stan  Ollie.ldquoThe whole premise is to tell stories about whatrsquos happening in everyday peoplersquos lives but within the context of isolation and the dficulties that that brings, said Marsan. His story, showing on Thursday, is about a man on a ldquogarden visit to his grandsons.Marsan has worked with many directors, including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. This time, it was his we Janine behind the camera.ldquoShe was fantastic, said the actor. ldquoShe really took it on.

The Scottish Government has a deplorable track record in trousering the local government funding it gets from Westminster for its own ends. Over the last  years, Scottish councils have lost seven per cent of their funding despite rising demand. As a result they have drained their reserves, and now find themselves in a nightmarish situation where revenue is noseing with people defaulting on rent and Council Tax just as demand for their services is hitting an all-time high. Unlike charities and businesses, councils cannot furlough their staff but have to bear all the costs of the lockdown themselves.All this means that the people councils serve are not only facing more hardship than ever before but far more than they need to. We see that, for example, in the thousands of businesses who have yet to receive their emergency grants, or the countless children who lack the support and equipment to be able to benefit from home schooling.Councils are the frontline when it comes to helping people through this crisis, and deserve much better treatment from this niggardly Government.Linda Holt , Anstruther.I THINK that Kate Forbes is right to seek proper detailed analyses of local government financial issues before releasing emergency funding. A fund of pound million will not go far.Already you note that Edinburgh and Highland are ldquoclaiming poundmillion between them.I realise that local authorities are doing a good job in these strange times but there are many things that are budgeted for that they are not doing too. I donrsquot think we should reimburse councils for lost income like lower parking charges or leisure centre fees .Letrsquos see the accounts.Allan McDougall, Neilston.THEATRES and concert halls were amongst the first public buildings to close to the public when the lockdown was introduced and we expect to be amongst the last to re-open. Every indication of a timetable for ato a ldquonew normalcy is that we will most likely find ourselves at the end of the phased process and it is equally likely that a large number valued cultural institutions will be have been lost along the way.It is a devastating situation for so many providers of cultural activity in Scotland. However, we have no choice but to accept this situation and we wait to be told under what conditions we may be able to open again so that we can plan to provide performances and events in restricted conditions. Many theatres like the Tron have performances ready to stage this autumn while at the same time we are well aware that the delay to re-opening may be a lot longer.I assume this principle will apply to all such places of public gathering. However, I read today that the Catholic Church in Scotland is drawing up a strategy to re-open buildings and for masses toin the near future . I wish the church good luck in its discussions with the Scottish Government on this issue but I am confused by the rationale. We are all buildings where the public assembles to communally participate in events. If a special dispensation is given then we should be allowed to stage theatre shows in churches after mass has ended ... at least until our own buildings can open again.Andy Arnold, Artistic Director, Tron Theatre, Glasgow.I AM a   live-in carer dedicated to caring for elderly and disabled people.I am employed by an agency currently advertising on national television for staffThis week I phoned the office three times to ask for PPE to be delivered to the address where I am looking after a client with underlying health issues.

Buy one of Power a Lersquos mobile charging devices and, in , a child receives a solar light that enables them to do their homework after sunset in villages or towns with no electricity.Itrsquos a simple but le-changing idea, which makes this yearrsquos Impact Summit on May th the ideal space for Warner to exhibit his company. The annual event, which brings together some of the brightest business minds from around the world to exchange ideas, is normally held in Glasgow, but will this year be hosted online.This will be Warnerrsquos second visit to the summit. At last yearrsquos event, he announced the delivery of  lights to three primary and secondary schools in rural Zimbabwe. He and his team subsequently travelled there to hand out lights and get a measure of what dference they were making to the academic achievements of the children. The results were startling.ldquoKids in Zimbabwe are tested every two weeks in their core subjects of English and maths, explains Warner. ldquoFor those who received solar lights, there were improvements across the board. The biggest increase was in maths, where the class average tripled in just eight weeks ndash from % to %.ldquoIn Zimbabwe, children who get % in these core subject can graduate to high school. This is the le-changing bit ndash kids that go on to high school have higher earning potential, better health, more opportunities and are more likely to lt themselves and their community out of poverty.The idea of gting light was the result of weeks of research living with villagers in Senegal. Warner knew he wanted to make a dference but wasnrsquot sure exactly how to create it.ldquoWe went in with no preconceived ideas, a completely blank canvas. We sat in meetings with villagers to better understand their challenges and initially considered two or three dozen enterprises ndash from granaries to irrigation projects and healthcare.ldquoBut one of the biggest shocks to the system was living completely off-grid, so no charging facilities for our laptops or devices or no way of doing work when the sun goes down. Thatrsquos the reality for  days of the year. Electricity really is the great enabler, so it was a logical place for us to start.Power and light have provided that launchpad for Warner and his tight team of specialists who help him design and market the Power a Le range of power banks and mobiles accessories. However, he is clear-sighted about the opportunities Africa can provide ndash a continent just beginning to explore the potential of off-grid energy solutions powered by renewables.ldquoMini-grids, off-grids and solar farms ndash thatrsquos where we want to end up. What wersquore super excited about is that the gt of light for kids creates really big markets for us with follow on products.ldquoItrsquos no strings attached, wersquore doing this to empower the kids, so they can be safe when they come home from school and get better grades, but mum and dad might say thatrsquos quite a handy light, can you do a bigger one for us, so now wersquore looking at small home solar systems. It could have a signicant impact in helping power off-grid communities with renewables.Like just about every other business, Power a Le is having to cope with the impact of the pandemic. Itrsquos especially frustrating for Warner as the social enterprisersquos strategy of focusing on the BBmarket as opposed to BCndash launched at last yearrsquos Impact Summit ndash had reached escape velocity in sales terms.During , the companyrsquos power banks for mobiles and laptops sold in the thousands rather than hundreds as they broke into the corporate market, which resulted in a corresponding increase in the number of solar lights they can deliver to Zimbabwean schools.But the pandemic has halted air shipments to Africa for the time being, and sales have inevitably been hit. Father of two Warner, though, is optimistic. His business ambition was ignited by the last financial crash when, as a University of Strathclyde trained architect, he went to work building luxury houses in Singapore and south-east Asia.The lsquodream jobrsquo, however, turned somewhat sour when he became disillusioned with his rich clients and the contrast between their lives and those endured by the Bangladeshi migrant workers on site.ldquoThere was certainly a feeling that when the whole world was falling apart around us as the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor. I wanted to use the design skills I learnt at Strathclyde to power the poor and not the rich, he explains.Hence the buy-to-give ethos of Power a Le, a model that hits the spot with the younger consumer cohort that includes millennials and Generation Z. Warner also believes the greater sense of community engendered by the pandemic will only further enhance the prospects forsocial enterprises.ldquoWe had already seen an appetite among corporates to do good with their purchasing. I think the virus will really focus the minds of corporate customers who will want to support charities, the NHS or communities further afield through the likes of us.And that can only be good news for eager to learn schoolchildren in Africa. Power a Le has a stated aim to deliver , solar lights to the continent by .ldquoWe had some pretty signicant momentum, a real head of steam before the virus hit, so wersquore still going to do our utmost to get to that number, says Warner, before adding: ldquoLetrsquos say wersquoll aim for the stars to land on the moon.To see the full schedule of Impact Summit keynotes and thevirtual exhibitor marketplace,go to www.impact-summit.org"},{"url":null,"title":"uk-govt-propose-stricter-social-distancing-measures-workplace-get-people-back-work","story":"Leaked draft documents from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy say extra cleaning should be introduced in office spaces and the use of protective equipment should be considered where maintaining a distance of two metres between workers is not possible.For workers who have customer-facing roles, plastic screens should be erected to help protect them, while continued home working and staggered shts should also be encouraged, the guidance says.The proposals are among a list of guidelines in seven documents drawn up after consultation with executives, trade bodies and unions.Workers look set to have their temperatures taken when they arrive for work to seethey have the virus and firms will also be told to lay on more parking spaces so that staff do not have to rely on lts from colleagues.Under the plans, millions of companies will have to draw up a Covid- \"risk assessment\" before allowing staff toto work.The guidance also says social distancing will have to be maintained, whether on the shop floor, in shopping queues, or in communal spaces.A Government spokesman said: \"The Business Secretary[Alok Sharma] continues to work with businesses, union leaders and the science and medical community so we can ensure workplaces are safe for those who will go back to work once the measures are relaxed and give people the confidence toto work.\"Mr Sharma is due to take questions in the Commons this afternoon.The draft guidance comes as Britain enters its seventh week of the lockdown with the Government review due on Thursday although it is thought Boris Johnson will address the nation on Sunday to lay out his plan for the next phase of the lockdown.The Prime Minister is expected to hold telephone talks with Nicola Sturgeon and her Welsh counterpart Mark Drakeford in the next  hours to discuss the strategy for a gradual easing of some of the restrictions.Later today, Mr Johnson in a speech will describe the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine as the \"most urgent shared endeavour of our letimes\" as he calls on nations to \"pull together\" in response to the pandemic.The PM is expected to tell an online pledging conference this afternoon - co-hosted by the UK and eight other countries and organisations - that the sooner states share their expertise, the faster scientists will succeed in defeating the disease.He will say: ldquoTo win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people, and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine.ldquoThe more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed.

The Scottish Government hopes it can move to the strategy by the end of May.Officials have set out five key steps for the strategy ldquo to be delivered effectively. Before it can begin, the Scottish Government first requires an ldquoeffective disease surveillance along with ldquoearly identication and isolation of possible cases.:UK Govt to propose range of social distancing measures in workplace to get people back to workTo push ahead with the strategy, officials need ldquoearly and rapid testing of possible cases where the capacity can ensure that ldquoeveryone who needs a test can get one.In order to be implemented, ldquoearly and effective tracing of close contacts of a confirmed case will be needed, as well as ldquoearly, effected and supported isolation of close contacts.The Scottish Government believes it ldquomay need to provide sufficient tests for around % of the population and will therefore need to be able to deliver up to , tests per day when lsquotest, trace, isolate, supportrsquo is fully rolled out.It adds that ldquotesting and tracing will only have an impact on reducing transmission in the communityclose contacts of confirmed cases self-isolate.:Coronavirus in Scotland: Contact tracing capacity has been slow, professor warnsThe document states: ldquoWe will be asking most people who have been in close contact with a confirmed case to remain at home completely during this time, isolating themselves as far as possible from other household members.ldquoFor example, anyone in isolation should not be undertaking outdoor exercise or shopping trips. If they then develop symptoms, any close contacts, such as household members, would then be asked to self-isolate.ldquoTest, trace, isolate, support, along with other public health interventions to reduce the risk of transmission, is likely to be part of le in Scotland until a vaccination programme for Covid- has been delivered. Our approach will develop over time to reflect new insights into the disease, and learning about the delivery of test, trace, isolate, support in Scotland and around the world.In the document, Ms Sturgeon warns that ldquowe will test people in the community who have symptoms and use contact tracing to ldquoidenty the close contacts of those cases.:Coronavirus: Visitors to UK face two weeks in quarantineShe adds: ldquoWe will ask and support those close contacts to self-isolate, so thatthey do develop the disease, there is less risk that they will pass it on to others. And we will make sure that support is available to enable people to isolate effectively.ldquoHowever, it is important to stress that ldquotest, trace, isolate, support will be most effective when levels of infection are low ndash lower than now ndash and stay low, and that its success relies on all of us knowing and agreeing what to dowe have symptoms, and being prepared to self-isolate when advised to do so.ldquoThis will not be easy. In this next phase, we will be asking people to self-isolate, not for their own benefit, and not because we know for certain that they have contracted the disease, but in order to protect others in case they have. People may face self-isolation not just once, but on repeat occasions.The document sets out that the test, trace, isolate strategy ldquowill not be effective on its own: but will run in parallel with existing measures including social distancing, hand hygiene and use of face coverings.The strategy will start with ldquocontacts of priority groups including patients and health and social care workers - before the Scottish Government ldquoquickly broadens coverage as we continue to increase our testing capacity."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-giovanna-eusebi-shares-memories-cooking-grandmother-lockdown-recipe-series","story":"Enjoying a simpler time making fresh ricotta cheese with her Nonna is one of the childhood memories that has stayed with Giovanna, who runs Glasgow family deli and restaurant Eusebis.And as lockdown during the coronavirus outbreak has seen many of us slow our hectic lives down, Giovanna has taken the chance to take her cooking back to basics in the hope of inspiring others to have a go.Read more: Coronavirus in Scotland: Giovanna Eusebis lockdown family feast recipes for you to tryShe has shared family feast ideas and Eusebis tiramisu recipes with and now in the final week of the series, she has come up with a challenge - cheesemaking.\"Ricotta made with the seasonrsquos first sweet milk would herald the beginning of spring in my grandmothers kitchen in Italy,\" said Giovanna.\"I can remember her making the ricotta and I would be shelling broad beans.

In challenging circumstances, however, they are not helped by supply chains that are simply not operating fairly or equitably.“During a recent conference call with the cabinet secretary and islands minister, I raised concerns about the behaviour of some suppliers towards our island communities.

Folk can do this by picking a m stretch of road or path, or by walking through a local greenspace and counting the number of instances of dog fouling in that area. You can then submit this information to Keep Scotland Beautul. The data is to be used to increase awareness and drive action to tackle what the charity has described as one of Scotland’s worst environmental complaints.Paul Wallace, campaigns manager with Keep Scotland Beautul said: “It is extremely disappointing that the thoughtless actions of irresponsible dog owners means that our shared enjoyment of our local open and green spaces, and a brief escape from the stresses and strains of the current situation, can be ruined.“That is why Keep Scotland Beautul is calling on iniduals and families to take part in #TurdTag, helping to gather evidence from communities across Scotland to get an accurate picture of the scale of this problem – it is simple and easy to take part as part of the daily exercise allowed in guidance from the Scottish Government.” Results should be submitted to cleanup@keepscotlandbeautul.org by May , and shared using social media and the hashtag #turdtag copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The academic suggested that the next stages of coronavirus containment could be developed earlier in the islands # but onlya comprehensive testing strategy was in place.Orkney and Shetland’s parliamentarians, Liam McArthur MSP, Alistair Carmichael MP and Beatrice Wishart MSP have called on the Scottish Government to provide assurances that they will engage meaningfully with Professor Pennington’s proposals and be open to considering how they might be implemented safely.Mr McArthur said: “Public safety must be paramount as decisions are taken about how and when the current restrictions might be lted.“In that context, however, Professor Pennington’s suggestions, which have already attracted a great deal of interest in Orkney and other island communities, deserve serious and urgent consideration.“If the Scottish Government genuinely want to treat the Scottish public ‘as grown ups’ then suggestions like these need to be dealt with in a transparent manner.“I have already written to both the Health Secretary and the First Minister to make this point, and to seek clarity on what consideration is being given to a more localised approach for the islands.  It is important that all options to tackling the coronavirus remain on the table during this unprecedented time.”Mr Carmichael added: “I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with these proposals seriously. That engagement must, however, also include close cooperation and discussion with local communities to ensure public confidence in safety.“This is not a plan that can be run centrally. Local input and know-how is key and islanders should be at the heart of how we translate these proposals into action.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Russell’s comments come in the wake of the First Minister’s announcement of an expansion of testing.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “There is an increasing level of public interest in the proposals put forward by Professor Pennington and Dr Allyson Pollock in recent weeks that the islands could start to ease lockdown restrictions sooner than mainland Scotland.“Such a strategy could only be adopted, however,a rigorous and extensive system of testing, tracing and isolating was firmly established. The First Minister’s announcement today of a further expansion of testing perhaps paves the way for such a system being put in place.“Public safety, of course, remains the priority and must underpin any decision taken in relation to how and when restrictions are eventually lted. That is true of our island communities as it is other parts of the country.“However, ministers must not discount possible options without proper consideration. I therefore welcome Mr Russell’s assurances that the government will engage actively and constructively in the debate about whether and how our islands might safely take the lead.“This is unlikely to lead to any quick decisions, not least as the stakes are so high. It is encouraging, however, that Ministers are prepared to keep an open mind over the coming week.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. I invite readers to check my above points and judge for themselves.Have a nice day, boys.JT:#I won’t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic “Punch and Judy” food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. ##pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments,#Pot meet kettle. I see you exemplied my points too # namely numbers ,  and  of the right wing playbook. I see you signed off by patronisingly calling us #boys#. Rising above it eh No one attacked you John. Engaging your in debate is not an attack. Calling people who you disagree with pompous might have been though.Inspiring attempts at deflection from John Tulloch. Clap the NHS and public sector workers without remembering many are subject to racist abuse why don#t we Let#s not consider how society might be madebetter after this mess, let alone how the UK has got into it so deeply. #Now you clap for me#was a welcome call for some, but not, John Tulloch. As founder of Wir Shetland#s UKIP, John is something of a past master when it comes to #stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness#, but we aren#t allowed to talk about that, about the complex nature or history of racism in Shetland, or anything closer to home than China it seems.Inconveniently for John though, lessons can be, and are being, learned now.These are hard times, but hard times are good times to imagine how things can and should be made better.#Now You Clap For Me# had something powerful to say.John Tulloch, however, remains somehow both vocal, but as yet, completely disengaged.A rising chorus of #Shetland for the Shets# might refocus him,anyone is feeling creative enough to write it. It goes to the tune of #We shall overcome#.I most say that over the years I’ve never been one to comment on any stories here or where on news items, but holy hell Shetland Times , what are you doing Mr Editor or moderator  A whole positive story totally hijacked by the same, apparently educated peoplethat plaster your letters, any and all topics, with the same diatribe time and time again !Argumentative boys should really just take their handbags, go to the play park and dance around them, after the lockdown is lted of course !Well done Shetland NHS for all you do for us and all that you endeavour to do to help keep us safe and healthy !!You tell them Steven! 😉Was Carmichael right to call the government#s approach ideological  Who cares  There is no room for politics in any of this. Could have been betterthe testing kit had been in the isles  days earlier though.ClearlyMr Brown was equally refering to you as well Mr Hamilton.Fair point, but you do not need the censors to step in, simply don#t scroll down. I cannot be relied upon for sensible or relevant debate. That much should be clear by now.Yes Laurence, I think I got that. It will be interesting to see what this week#s Sunday Times has in store for Boris.I don’t read the Sunday Times Petrus, but I can tell you that there is a seat in the hall of linguistic fame for Johnson. He has given rise to a new noun: boris. It replaces an eight-letter, rather rude one, that begins with a “d “and ends with a “d”. Suggested usage: Don’t be a boris, stay safe, stay well.Carrie Symonds!! Love you Peter, such a star.Love you too Ian, good to see you, evenonly virtually while the lockdown is on.Not normally a fan myself Rosa, of The Sunday Times, but the  days Boris wasted got full front page coverage on the th. This means, for the purists, that the above good news story could have come a lot earlier.The increasingly tragic outcome, the delay and the ideology of this government of disaster capitalists are all directly linked.As for an eight letter word to describe superspreader Johnson, well frankly Rosa, I am at a loss. It is a letter short, but maybe #dullard# It would probably take someone with proper scientic training to know for sure.Led by the scientists indeed.Meanwhile, for those with a rudimentaryappreciation for creativity and the arts, I will offer the following, with an apology to those readers with more refined sensibilities: Ours us but to clap and cry.Another beautully poetic, uplting and helpful contribution has arrived, affording us the chance to step back and envision a better future.I think this touching poem as bedtime story is powerful enough to make most folk value the role of the creative arts in education and STEM the fixation that maths and science matter more.Not everything that matters can be counted and not everything that can be counted matters..."},{"url":null,"title":"seafood industry support welcomed by sfa ","story":"Shetland Fishermen#s Associationhas welcomed additional Scottish government support for #one of the most beleaguered segments of Scotland#s fishing industry#.The SFA also warned that seafood businesses should not be allowed to fail because of Covid-.A further £.m to help large sea fishing vessels was announced by the Scottish government on Friday, bringing seafood industry support to £.m.The latest scheme provides capped payments of up to £, per vessel to businesses with a vessel over  metres landing shellfish such as crab, lobster, scallop and langoustine # to help them meet fixed costs like insurance.

This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property.

Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist.Nuclear Energy does have its dangerous pitfalls, but we are already using this technology to generate electricity. I believe % of our electricity is produced by nuclear power  In France I believe this to be much higher  Although it may be dficult to assess the impact of solar or wind generators on the environment on a large scale, it would have to be balanced between the use of such technology to this of the environmental and eco-systems which maybe affected.I do not know how much land would be required to provide electricity to a city of several million, but I would hazard a guess it would be quite considerable  This use would also have to compete with farming and agriculture not to mention living space for housing etc etc.  from the shore would these wind turbines be  I suspect it would be quite close  Will our seashores be lined up with thousands of wind turbines I would also suspect the cost of such a scenario would be very high in adoption and maintenance.lol Hayden. Disturbing as it may be, I do not think we will have much option but to go nuclear. If it were a case of saving the environment and eco-systems, one may not have any choice We are already using this technology to produce electricity, andit is the case of minimizing our impact on the environment and eco-systems, then nuclear maybe the only way Cleaner energy may be, morally, more suited, but one must also take into consideration the impact on the environment and eco-systems and how this may change towards a negative once we realize the full influence of this compared to the potential benefits I cannot give any answers to what a large scale wind or solar scheme would be to power several millions homes, but I would suspect it would be considerably large in land area  One could use the same land for agriculture and farming and possibly housing  Shetland is suited for wind generating power schemes, but what would be the benefits to this of tourism, bird populations and property values, not to mention the visual impact of those people living near to such schemes and the consistent vibrating noise.Agriculture, farming and housing would not be adversely affected.

But with no likelihood of visitors coming to our place anytime soon, there is something slightly morose and sad about making the buildings and cabins look neat, well maintained and tidy.It all seems a bit soulless and Marie Celeste-like with no guests.While being locked down at home, being busy, fixing and decorating, and even dare I say it, having a good time with family, there is an emerging sense of frustration, even perhaps inadequacy.Others are out there being essential, being key workers and worthwhile, ‘fighting’ the virus, supporting the vulnerable, while I….make a patio.I think for many people, there is a need to feel useful, and it is perhaps why for me the motorbike ride is so important.While there is nothing heroic about delivering a few medicines, it gets me out of the house # we might have a big cabin, but it still induces a fever.Being part of a support network and involved in helping the community works both ways and fulfils a very real need in those helping.Perhaps everybody wants to feel essential.We can laud the NHS staff, care workers, shop assistants and delivery drivers, but no one is going to clap for the furloughed hospitality workers and idle outdoor instructors.As a volunteer, however, we can all feel that we are doing our bit.There is a huge grey area surrounding the concept of key worker and essential.At first glance, it may seem obvious as to who is key # doctors, nurses, carers and the like but then there are the people who support them.Key workers need paid, so require office staff. They need fed, so also use food shops.They need to get to work, so are likely to drive a vehicle, so they need fuel. Andthe car breaks down, they will need a mechanic.They need water and electricity and the internet, and might also need a treat delivered from a mail order company during their well-deserved down time.Then there are the people who support the people who support the people who support…and so on.And so there emerges a whole network of service providers, businesses large and small # a web of commerce and production.In order to provide for the frontline, a whole system of interrelated businesses exists, many which might not appear to be essential, but may provide a key element, a small cog in the big picture.In the short term key workers can perhaps get by, but society shouldn’t allow its critical people to just muddle through, as the lockdown period extends, then the need for this support becomes more evident and relevant, and so the web of essentiality widens.As more roles, jobs and links in society are realised and considered necessary, and indispensability spreads, recreation and tourism won’t get much of a look in.We could argue that people need to visit the Old Man of Storr for our economic well-being as much as for their own health and well-being, but for the time being the beds and hot spots will remain empty.So, in order to be relevant and useful, we should perhaps look to our other skills.If tourism is our only income then we have to be creative, not only to make provision but to keep spirit and self-actualisation alive.Economically,tourism is a second income, the icing on the salaried or pensioned cake, then perhaps we just take the hit, and revert back to a less affluent lestyle.Many tourist providers left skills and talents in a previous le, perhaps now is the time to revisit and reimagine those skills.As I understand it, Skye is still waiting.Perhaps by the time this column is online, the virus will be more evident, during this waiting game now more than ever we need to be physically distant, and careful with how we operate.But it is crucial that we also need to look after our mental health and well-being, and so delivering the prescriptions is really as important to volunteer as it is for the receiver.Humans are a social animal, and we need to be part of a community, because we are all essential.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/norrie-grandfather.jpg","title":"norrie t macdonald the cycle of the sea and island traditions of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAlthough Shinigeadh was our training pool as youngstersand probably today seems quite safe and relatively innocuous it was also my first introduction to the concept of ‘industrial’ fishing.was strictly for deployment only by the stronger adults.It consisted of a stf polefrom which was slung a netted hoop, around - feet in diameter.It was to our mini-bamboo rods, what the Broch purse-seiner was to the Scalpay ring-netter.There had obviously been a couple of nights where our amateur, one-at-a-time, efforts to procure a decent supper had been insufficient to adequately harvest the bounty on offer.I remember the bodach and both the uncles appearing with the borrowed ‘poc’, intrigued as to what purpose it could possibly serve.’.A couple of pocketfuls of just-about-right, newly boiled, potatoes were the secret weapon.The cuddies scattered as the ‘poc’ got lowered into the sea.Crushing a potato into small pieces and scattering on the surface elicited a frenzy of activity.The timing of the hauling of the ‘poc’ was crucial.A miss, and you could maybe only land a couple.A full hit and you might struggle to lt it out of the water at all, requiring a re-submersion.This could result in losing the lot, the elusive cuddy being much quicker than the second haul.It took the knotting of the legs and sleeves of one of the standard, adult, blue boiler suits to make a receptacle big enough to take that night’s catch home.It was the first time I observed the tradition of the ‘share’.Walking back through the village, it was like we were expected.Several caileachs came to their gate with a basin, each the recipient of half a dozen dozen fish, dependent on their familysize.It was a tradition Iain ‘Scud’ MacLeod, George ‘Baba’ Richards and myself continued as we graduated onto the big bamboo in Bayble School.They were my fishing buddies as we moved onto the next level in our adventures.The full bamboo rod required technique and balance.Especially when we moved further afield onto the more dficult fishing hot-spots. every night.We were careful not to take the prime spots lest we got a mouthful, but we were tutored and encouraged, warned about any pitfalls and certainly well chaperoned for our own education and safety.We moved further up towards the Tiumpan where the rocks were more daunting, each climb steeper and requiring a working knowledge of the way down.With a -foot pole and in wellies.’ were the favourites, not too tricky a climb and with deep water just off the inside-point. were reserved for night when we felt particularly brave or even simply when they hadn’t been claimed by the adults.They were prime locations, great fishing spots, but generally could only accommodate a single rod.’ were up at the Tiumpan itself and required the right combination of tides and prevailing wind to be accessible, safe and productive. .The big rod came with several dferent options.The flywhich mimicked sand eels, consisted of usually three, four or six hooks, depending on what you were after .It could be deployed with, or without, a weight on the end.’was an issue.In the deeper water, a ‘dandy’ was best. This involved far less effort, a simple up and down motion of the tip of the rod producing plentul yields.’, basin outstretched, every night we caught more than was our fill.We also, as we got more adventurous, took to a bigger, single, hook and a longer, single trace .Barring this, a rubber eel.We were moving up from cuddy to lythe.What a fright the first one gave me!Two pulls of almighty force, then ‘I give up’.Deadweight.The sense of yet another ‘graduation’ was palpable, but the lythe was no grand fighting fish.It marked another progression up whatever the fishing ‘ladder’ was.By this time we were regulars in the town and had had our introduction to Meg’s ‘Electro Sports’ shop.He had, to our limited experience anyway, a huge assortment of rods and tackle for us to gawp at.Naturally, we moved up to spinning rods, monofilament, lures, kosters and paternosters., in competitions to see who could be the first to ,  or even .Traumatised for an hour or so, they would get ed to the water as the sun began to set.With spinning rods we learned a completely dferent set of rules.What was deep  yards out and what was disaster for your tackle.How to tie a proper knot and which kit worked best for the conditions.How to unravel a reel-tangle with three mackerel on the line .The cost of losing gear was beginning to hit the pocket-money hard.The only real solution was to get better at making your own.You learned how to make your own trace # downy seagull feathers were better, but not as practical as sheep’s wool # and how to tie knots that never ‘slipped’.Graduating onto more ‘specialist’ fish and fishing became a challenge after years of cuddies, mackerel and lythe.Fancier bait lugworm, real sand eel, salted herring even, were meant to be great to entice the bottom feeders flounder, sole, gurnard, possibly haddock and lingyou could reach with a long cast.Ok, so we mostly caught dogfish and, like every single other thing we pulled up, handling one came with its own set of rules.Mackerel have a nasty wee ‘sting’ in front of their anal fin, a small protrusion of cartilage bone which can catch the unwary out.Gurnard require welding gloves and a lesser-spotted dogfish will try to wrap its tail around your arm and give you a nasty ‘Chinese burn’.Rub your fingers against the ‘grain’ of one’s scales next time you see one.It’s like rough sandpaper.Everyone’s ambition, however, was to get out on one of the village boats.We had grown up with Roddy Alec and ‘Saight’, the last proper village fishermen who plied their trade on the ‘Fisher Lass’ out of Portnaguran.The ‘Fisher Lass’ was a substantial wooden boat, somewhere between the privately owned ‘rowing’ boats # each one now had a Seagull, Mariner or Evinrude rather than rely on such menial propulsion # and the commercial trawlers.Hers was a serious purpose we just wanted some fun.Whilst the rocks could disappoint, we were brought up with the notion that being a quarter mile offshore must come with an assurance of plenty.There were boats on the Portvoller side as well.The trick was, in the absence of having a boat in the family, knowing someone who did and whose father uncle was prepared to take responsibility for you for a couple of hours.Three a side, with mackerel or herring running, was huge entertainment.It was, necessitated by space and safety, ato hand lines again and a degree of ‘back to basics’ which felt very raw..A fish meal factory, dependent mostly on locally caught sand eels, but which handled mackerel and pout when available it could stink out the entire town given the right conditions.My father would come home, not entirely fragrant, and I would rush to get the folded-up daily paper from his lunch box.There were days, especially in the height of summer, when I couldn’t get beyond the back page .Little did I realise, until many years later, the destruction caused by overfishing of the type to assault the senses so violently..Barryhad procurement of his uncle’s boat and we made an anchor out of an old engine, attached a buoy and plastic ring, then ran yds of mm, in a loop, to the shore.The rest, you might say, is piracy.All good fun until the fishery cruiser, possibly the ‘Minna’, I couldn’t comment, came along one morning and confiscated the net, cod ‘n’ all.Now this could have been a delicious irony.I referred last week to the passing down of genes through the generations.The son and ‘heir to fresh air’ was never a guy to show his hand early, certainly not while in school.We had no clue what career path he would decide on, his head, whilst not always in proximity, wascertainly edging closer to the clouds.“I’m going to sea Da, to do marine engineering”, he one day boldly announced.Luckily, no one had a feather handy.And that’s what he did.He qualied as a ship’s engineer.It shouldn’t have been too hard to figure out where this notion came from, however., MacIver was the Chief Engineeron the old Fishery Protection Vessel, “Minna”.It is indeed a tangled web.Years later I ended up, standing on several fish boxes in the mart in Stornoway, as a fish-salesman.In my apprenticeship, under George Prince Jnr, we oversaw the landing of tens of thousands of tonnes of sand eels to HBP.The fishery was devastated, almost entirely, by local vessels and a couplefrom Barra.But while the smell was awful, the money was fantastic for all those involved.As the years progressed, the main catch moved from fish to prawns.I could tell the dference between a dab, a plaice, a brill, a turbot, a halibut, a megrim and a witch, but saw increasinglyless and less of them each year.My good pal Stuart Keyte – the local fishery officer # and I bought a small, Orkney origin, ‘clinker’-built -footer to work some creels and have a bit of ploy.You can get used to two lobsters for breakfast.But only for a wee while.Despite HBP closing down and the fishery banned, the knock-on effects of overfishing, several stocks over several decades, were beginning to take their toll.I could go to the rocks for nights on end and catch nothing.As it was, I ended up on the rocks anyway.A spell clam fishing with John Murdo ‘Easdaidh’ MacLeod was my swan song.I loved it.We left the harbour every day at am and headed for, guess where Correct, the Tiumpan.As day broke we would haul the six dredges and he would get the frying pan on whilst I sorted the catch.I could see the lights in my house going on from half a mile at sea .We had two rolls each and a cup of coffee.A huge scallop, bacon, black-pudding and fried egg on each .“If they fit through the handle of the basket, throw them over” was the rule of thumb.I’m guessing we could have been inside ‘the limit’.I’ve never fished a Loch nor a river.Not remotely interested.Given my track record, I’d have probably used a bit of dynamite, certainly a bit of mono.Just for dramatic effect.Mother Nature, left to her own devices, is a truly wonderful thing.Stocks will, eventually, recover and, managed properly could give sustainable employment for years to come.Maybe even endless fun for kids who have got too accustomed and fed up, paralysed even, from the catatonic effects of lockdown.Remember what Dougie said to Para Handy ‘The herring in Loch Fyne comes in cycles’‘Ach man’, replied Macfarlane, ‘There wass herring in the Loch long afore the cycle was inventit’.Everything goes around folks.Remember it when you contemplate your next move.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh an gobha ruadh agus domhnall an oir","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine..

Otherwise they could have bill shocks and in the worst case could be left in debt as their payments do not cover the higher consumption.”He continued: “Recent usage reports indicate that households are using around a fth more energy as they stay at home during the lockdown.

Dr Abbie Hartestudied for six years to achieve her medicine degree, which she was awarded via her laptop screen in a virtual celebration last Tuesday amid the Covid- lockdown restrictions.A rite of passage for all university students, Dr Harte said the virtual ceremony was a memorable way to mark the end of her degree, despite not being the celebration she had dreamed of.Queen#s students due to graduate this year were informed of the change via email. The university has committed to holding further celebrations in the future to allow graduates to reflect on their achievements with family and friends.Dr Harte said: Although a traditional ceremony would be nice to mark the end of our medical degree and a lovely way to celebrate with close family and friends, I think that we are all extremely understanding of the current situation and why we weren#t able to have a traditional ceremony.It wasn#t the celebration we were all hoping to have, but it was a lovely day and I was able to celebrate with my close family to acknowledge the end of a challenging six years.It#s definitely a small sacrice to make, especially when you see how hard all key workers are working at the moment.Dr Harte will soon join the fight against Covid- as she takes up a post in the Belfast trust months earlier than initially expected. Final year medical students at QUB have been granted provisional registration earlier than normal to help ease the immense pressure facing local health professionals.She continued: Covid- has affected everyone, daily lives have changed and many plans and big celebrations have been cancelled.I am just grateful that myself and my colleagues have been able to graduate early and can start helping out wherever we can.It was lovely to see that the majority of final year students were happy to take up this position and will be starting over the next few weeks. It does seem very daunting to start working in such unusual circumstances, but I feel we will all be very well supported.Newly-qualied doctors will take up posts in the hospitals alongside other clinicians where they completed their most recent placement.This is because they have gone through the induction process and are familiar with the hospital environment, fellow staff and procedures.However, they will not necessarilyto wards where they have worked previously as many services have been reconfigured in preparation for the coronavirus pandemic.Legislation has also been developed to enable final-year student nurses within six months of registration to go into the NHS in a paid capacity.Meanwhile, QUB law student Kristina Sundin-Maheralsaid graduates deserve a traditional ceremony later this year to formally recognise their efforts.Donning a gown and hat and taking to the stage to collect your degree is a huge motivation for students as they study for their exams, the Canadian woman said.Everyone was really looking forward to graduation, Queen#s do it so well and it#s such a prestigious event, she said. Queen#s put on the nicest day, they do such a great job. However, it#s understandable, there#s no way with the current situation that it could go ahead in July with so many people.I was really happy to hear they are planning to do something in future.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Please can you let me know , after the five criteria are met, is being able to hug our closest family one of the first steps out of lockdown Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the question brought home the emotional impact of lockdown and that he hoped it would be allowed as soon as possible, although Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned that for some vulnerable groups, close contact with family may continue to be a risk for some time.Lara Crisp, editor of the grandparents# social networking site Gransnet, agrees lockdown has been particularly tough for grandparents as they#re more likely to be in high-risk categories and completely cut off from their beloved grandchildren.She says that the impact on grandparents# mental health is undeniable.A Gransnet survey found % of grandparents were concerned about their mental health during lockdown and even morewere worried about their children#s mental health.This is a tough time for all of us, but grandparents are finding it incredibly hard for a number of reasons, Crisp explains.What#s interesting is that worry about their children and grandchildren and maintaining those bonds supersedes concern for their own health.However, she believes many grandparents are finding novel ways to keep in touch with family and friends, often embracing new technology, and finding ways to support each other.Here, she outlines what grandparents are most concerned about during lockdown - and how they#re coping.Staying connectedGrandparents are working on new ways to stay connected, with % saying they#re speaking to friends and family more during lockdown and % stating they#re maintaining their social relationships well virtually.The positive side of technology has certainly proved itself in recent weeks through family WhatsApp groups, video calls, and online communities such as Gransnet. Of course, they aren#t a replacement for real-le hugs with your loved ones, but for now they are an excellent alternative for staying in touch, Crisp says.First-time grandparentsGrandparents who#ve been anxiously awaiting the birth of their new grandchild are now denied the opportunity to see the precious newborns.The exquisite joy of having a tiny hand wrap around your finger, or that new baby smell - these simple pleasures just can#t be conveyed across FaceTime. For now, grandparents are making do with regular calls and new parents are sending frequent photographic evidence of gummy first smiles and sleeping babes, says Crisp.ChildcareAlthough % of grandparents are concerned about the effect lockdown is having on their relationship with their grandchildren, this isn#t their only worry.In normal times, families rely on grandparents for childcare and grandparents are used to having this regular contact.Crisp reflects: Without it, many feel helpless. They can see how hard it is for their families to juggle working from home with trying to keep the kids up-to-date on schoolwork and feel they want to help in some way.She adds, however, that many grandparents are supervising their grandchildren#s schoolwork on video calls and taking part in bedtime routines by reading to their grandkids.This works bettergranny and grandchild have a copy of the same book they can read at the same time, she adds.Other suggestions include posting seeds and then sharing photos as they grow.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The former Ireland captain spoke to the Sunday Independent newspaper yesterday about le after the Lions - and histo the farm.We#re all in pursuit of a purpose in some shape or form, especially when you recently retire from rugby, he said.That purpose was very much the match and the training. And when you retire, there is a massive void to try to fill. I don#t think you ever fill that very quickly, Best told the newspaper. It#s the purpose of #what am I going to be # I am no longer Rory Best, the rugby player. Rory who studied agriculture while attending Newcastle University - enjoys his new agricultural lestyle.You know, it#s a nice routine, he says. You get up in the morning. You go out to the cattle. It is this time of year where we#re calving the cows and we#re trying to get everything out into the field. It#s a lovely feeling - to drop the cattle out of the trailer and they have spent the winter in sheds, confined. You give them these open spaces and you watch them take off. There is something very satisfying about that. So, there are a lot of rewarding times and the weather has helped.At the start of the Covid- crisis, his middle brother Mark and sister Rebecca both ed from London to the family home in Co Armagh. That meant mum and dad and them were staying together, Best said. They self-isolated for two weeks. So, then dad wasn#t really allowed out. I took over doing all the farm work and tried to fill that to get that done. For Rory and Jody, his we of  years, the lockdown le has opened up a wealth of new opportunities to enjoy le with their children.I raised the flowerbeds from some wooden sleepers we had at home, Rory said.We had fun as a family planting those. I think, in this crazy world, you don#t ever think you have time to do these simple things. When you put it into perspective and you put it into that context, I think we just have to get on with it. We know what is happening.We know it is for the best, to stay at home and to stay isolated and remain positive. Otherwise, you#ll send yourself mad.Belfast Most ReadNesbitt quits Stormont committee over lockdown infringementWe need answers, says family of Ronnie Falloon who died from coronavirus in Lisburn nursing homeIreland rugby hero Rory Best enjoying country le during cornavirus lockdownSocially-distanced plans for VE day across Northern IrelandMan in hospital after being stabbed in west Belfast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And in the process the big hearted Blueman has helped raise £, for NHS frontline heroes. The charitable initiative was kicked off late last month by the st Raven Linfield Supporters club, who encouraged their members to run or walk k for the medical teams who are risking their lives every day to help victims of the coronavirus pandemic.The club, based in east Belfast, had initially set a target of £, but soon found the donations rolling in.And when they were £ away from reaching their new goal of £,, a group of Glentoran supporters offered to meet the shortfall. But they added one condition - that they would only hand over the cashdyed-in-the-wool Linfield fanatic Stephen would do his k in a Glentoran shirt, shorts and socks. It#s the last kit I would normally wear, says Stephen.But the NHS workers have been so fantastic that I was happy to rise to the Glenmen#s challenge. But just this once.Stephen admits he got strange looks from people who know his football allegiances as he walked through east Belfast where he lives, in his borrowed red, green and black gear.He says: There was a lot of banter too but I made it clear to everyone that I hadn#t gone over to the dark side.I#m still blue through and though. Some people along the way to Stormont also wondered why I wasn#t running the k.But I#m hardly the picture of fitness soI#d run instead of walking, I would probably have put added pressure on the NHS because I might have needed some medical attention myself, erting the doctors and nurses from the real problems they#re facing.The Glentoran donation came from the Raven Glentoran supporters club, who meet in the same social club as the Linfield fans.Stephen Beattie, a member of the Glentoran club, said: People are always talking up the bad relationships between Bluemen and Glenmen but at the Raven club we all get on well.We were pleased to do our bit for the NHS fundraiser and it was made even more worthwhile by seeing Stephen dressed so well on Saturday.Sadly however, he turned down the chance to keep the kit.Belfast Most ReadNesbitt quits Stormont committee over lockdown infringementWe need answers, says family of Ronnie Falloon who died from coronavirus in Lisburn nursing homeIreland rugby hero Rory Best enjoying country le during cornavirus lockdownSocially-distanced plans for VE day across Northern IrelandMan in hospital after being stabbed in west Belfast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In a joint statement, the leaders of the Church of Ireland, Methodist Church in Ireland, Catholic Church, Presbyterian Church and the Irish Council of Churches, said they accept that now is not the time for a fullto collective worship in our Churches.However, they asked for the issue to be reviewed regularly.The issue of church buildings being permitted to open for inidual visits and private prayer, where this is desired locally and can be done so safely with appropriate social distancing in place, is however a dferent and a separate matter, they said.Where the medical and scientic advice indicates that this limited step is possible, we would urge the Executive to consider easing this particular restriction sooner rather than later.Last week, Stormont minister Edwin Poots suggested there could be a phased reopening of churches with the capacity to implement social distancing. He said any changes would only be made in line with medical and scientic advice, but that ministers were aware of the negative impact the rules were having on the public. Mr Poots, who attends a church with  seats, said: If we can facilitate social distancing, can we do it  That#s a reasonable question to ask.Speaking yesterday, new Church of Ireland Primate Archbishop John McDowell said Churches did not want to have any special treatment, but would like to be considered on their own merits. There are lots of things impacted by what is going on right now, and things of course need to be thought through properly at every stage. But faith is very important to people and one of the things that is clear at the moment is that the clergy are still in close contact with people, he said. Of course that contact is not the same as it was with people coming into churches and clergy going to see them, but people are still ringing around and the clergy have a strong feel for how people are. There is no doubt there is quite a lot of frustration. Not just because of restrictions around attending church. In some very serious scenarios of course, there are even people in abusive situations, and all of it is very dficult.In their statement, which followed a video conferencing meeting on Friday, the Church leaders told how the current restrictions were challenging but also for the good and the protection of everyone across our island.Archbishop McDowell added: We recognise that on the one hand we#re citizens that need to respond positively to what is being asked of us by governments and public health authorities.And at the same time as leaders of faith communities, we like to think of ourselves as people of hope. There are tens of thousands of people who look forward to going to church every Sunday, and some who go even more frequently than that. This is a very serious emergency we#re in, and none of us can quite see our way through the fog. Whatever happens next is going to be slow and gradual, and the nature of the disease will dictate the nature of the reaction. But at some time when these decisions are being made we hope we will be treated on our merit as Churches and responsible people to do everything required in terms of social distancing or whatever other measures may be needed.Belfast Most ReadNesbitt quits Stormont committee over lockdown infringementWe need answers, says family of Ronnie Falloon who died from coronavirus in Lisburn nursing homeIreland rugby hero Rory Best enjoying country le during cornavirus lockdownSocially-distanced plans for VE day across Northern IrelandMan in hospital after being stabbed in west Belfast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Elected representatives from across the north west have called on the Executive to sign off on a medical school at Magee and match funding for Derry’s City Deal. The Executive will meet today and SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin today said that with three weeks to get it over the line it must be top of their agenda. “I urge all Executive Ministers to make a call this week. Let’s get it done, together,” she added. googletag.cmd.push An Ulster University spokesperson stated that it is steadfast in its commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point, and to future proof care provision across Northern Ireland. “The University’s completed Outline Business Case was submitted to the Department of Health on st October and we are hopeful that it will be reviewed by the Minister as soon as possible. “We continue to work with the General Medical Council to gain full accreditation. The GMC’s Stage  process can only be completed when it recommends progression to Stage , and that is only possible when a funding decision is confirmed. googletag.cmd.push “To complete the next stages with the GMC in preparation and readiness for a  intake of students, confirmation of a funding commitment is required by the end of May.” The department of health is readying its own business case for medical expansion in Northern Ireland but gave no assurances that a medical school will be based in Derry. Meanwhile, another government department, that for the economy, has told the Derry News that Ulster University’s business case for expansion to , full-time students requires ‘signicant work’. Long-running plans for a medical school at Ulster University’s Magee campus have been plagued by set-backs. A revised timeline targeted student enrolment in . The Derry News asked the department whether it expects the medical school to be approved and for medical students to enrol at Magee next year. In response, a Department of Health spokesperson said: “The establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. “The Department of Health has been clear that there are two separate business case processes in relation to the development of a Graduate Entry Medical School. “The first process, which has been under way since , has involved signicant assistance from departmental officials on the development of Ulster University’s own business case. “Ulster University has been grateful for this assistance, which has ensured that their business case meets the standards within government financial guidance.” He added: “The second process is the development of the Department of Health’s own business case which will outline the need to be addressed by any expansion of medical education. “That business case will be formally submitted to the Minister very shortly. It will be appreciated that the department’s immediate and overriding priority has been the local response to the Coronavirus pandemic. “The Department of Health must ensure that any proposal represents value for money for health and social care. It is for the Executive to collectively decide on the best approach for Northern Ireland as a whole.” COMMITMENTS There was renewed optimism in January of this year when a deal was agreed by Northern Ireland’s political parties to restore devolved government three years after it collapsed. The New Decade, New Approach document contains firm commitments to a Magee Medical School from both the British and Irish governments. It states: “The Executive will expand university provision at Magee in line with commitments made by the previous Executive, including through the establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School.” Furthermore, under the section outlining the UK government’s financial and economic commitments to Northern Ireland it says: “Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project.” While the Irish government adds that it is ‘willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government.’ The commitment made by the previous Executive was for , full-time students at Magee. In   there were , full-time students enrolled at Magee – , overall. Five years previous,  , there were , full-time enrolments – , overall. In a statement to the Derry News, spokesperson for the Department for the Economysaid it is committed to engaging with Ulster University regarding expansion of its Magee campus, including taking account of priorities set out in New Decade, New Approach. “The university confirmed in correspondence to the Department in September  that it has remained committed to securing expansion of its Magee campus, and at the same time confirmed that the business case required updating prior to any consideration by the Department or Executive. “The Department also recognises, however, that the business case requires signicant work.” The Department of Finance voiced its support for the establishment of a medical school in Derry saying it is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister, Conor Murphy hosted a meeting with representatives of the North West on April  to discuss the Magee Medical School, City Deals and the Inclusive Future Fund. Following the meeting, the Minister said: Today’s meeting was a continuation of positive engagement I’ve had over recent months with the North West. I’ve already expressed my support for the City Deal  Inclusive Future Fund which will be discussed at the Executive.

Elected representatives from across the north west have called on the Executive to sign off on a medical school at Magee and match funding for Derry’s City Deal. The Executive will meet today and SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin today said that with three weeks to get it over the line it must be top of their agenda. “I urge all Executive Ministers to make a call this week. Let’s get it done, together,” she added. googletag.cmd.push An Ulster University spokesperson stated that it is steadfast in its commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point, and to future proof care provision across Northern Ireland. “The University’s completed Outline Business Case was submitted to the Department of Health on st October and we are hopeful that it will be reviewed by the Minister as soon as possible. “We continue to work with the General Medical Council to gain full accreditation. The GMC’s Stage  process can only be completed when it recommends progression to Stage , and that is only possible when a funding decision is confirmed. googletag.cmd.push “To complete the next stages with the GMC in preparation and readiness for a  intake of students, confirmation of a funding commitment is required by the end of May.” The department of health is readying its own business case for medical expansion in Northern Ireland but gave no assurances that a medical school will be based in Derry. Meanwhile, another government department, that for the economy, has told the Derry News that Ulster University’s business case for expansion to , full-time students requires ‘signicant work’. Long-running plans for a medical school at Ulster University’s Magee campus have been plagued by set-backs. A revised timeline targeted student enrolment in . The Derry News asked the department whether it expects the medical school to be approved and for medical students to enrol at Magee next year. In response, a Department of Health spokesperson said: “The establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. “The Department of Health has been clear that there are two separate business case processes in relation to the development of a Graduate Entry Medical School. “The first process, which has been under way since , has involved signicant assistance from departmental officials on the development of Ulster University’s own business case. “Ulster University has been grateful for this assistance, which has ensured that their business case meets the standards within government financial guidance.” He added: “The second process is the development of the Department of Health’s own business case which will outline the need to be addressed by any expansion of medical education. “That business case will be formally submitted to the Minister very shortly. It will be appreciated that the department’s immediate and overriding priority has been the local response to the Coronavirus pandemic. “The Department of Health must ensure that any proposal represents value for money for health and social care. It is for the Executive to collectively decide on the best approach for Northern Ireland as a whole.” COMMITMENTS There was renewed optimism in January of this year when a deal was agreed by Northern Ireland’s political parties to restore devolved government three years after it collapsed. The New Decade, New Approach document contains firm commitments to a Magee Medical School from both the British and Irish governments. It states: “The Executive will expand university provision at Magee in line with commitments made by the previous Executive, including through the establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School.” Furthermore, under the section outlining the UK government’s financial and economic commitments to Northern Ireland it says: “Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project.” While the Irish government adds that it is ‘willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government.’ The commitment made by the previous Executive was for , full-time students at Magee. In   there were , full-time students enrolled at Magee – , overall. Five years previous,  , there were , full-time enrolments – , overall. In a statement to the Derry News, spokesperson for the Department for the Economysaid it is committed to engaging with Ulster University regarding expansion of its Magee campus, including taking account of priorities set out in New Decade, New Approach. “The university confirmed in correspondence to the Department in September  that it has remained committed to securing expansion of its Magee campus, and at the same time confirmed that the business case required updating prior to any consideration by the Department or Executive. “The Department also recognises, however, that the business case requires signicant work.” The Department of Finance voiced its support for the establishment of a medical school in Derry saying it is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister, Conor Murphy hosted a meeting with representatives of the North West on April  to discuss the Magee Medical School, City Deals and the Inclusive Future Fund. Following the meeting, the Minister said: Today’s meeting was a continuation of positive engagement I’ve had over recent months with the North West.

Taking to Twitter the Sinn Feacutein Vice-President said: Delighted that the Executive has agreed to match fund Derry  Strabane City Deal Inclusive Future Fund of pound million transformative for Derry and the NW  goes some way to redress decades of underinvestment after years of hard work by political, community  business leaders. In a statement to the Derry News over the weekend Derry City  Strabane District Council said that ‘all project proposals’ have been submitted to the government at this stage. googletag.cmd.push It is a year since it was announced that the Derry region will receive pound million from the UK Government. Last week, deputy chair of the Northern Ireland Assembly’s economy committee Sinead Mclaughlin asked Minister Diane Dodds for an update on Derry’s City Deal. The Minister said the North West deal is ‘still being worked on’ and she ‘hopes Heads of Terms will be signed off in May or June’. She added that ‘signicant work has gone into it’. Heads of Terms is a document which sets out the terms of a commercial transaction agreed in principle between parties in the course of negotiations. googletag.cmd.push In November of last year the local council stated that this document would be signed-off within weeks. The package - pound million for the Derry and Strabane City Deal and poundm for the new Inclusive Future Fund - aims to boost the economic potential of the city and wider region. Once it is signed, work will progress on the preparation of a portfolio of outline business cases for the full range of projects, a process which will take - months. Alongside this, confirmation is needed of required revenue funding to support capital investment, in particular in relation to the proposed Graduate Entry Medical School. A spokesperson for the local council said it is continuing to engage with partners and stakeholders to progress with a pathway and timeline for bringing forward the City Deal to the next stage. All project proposals have been submitted to government at this stage and Council continues to work with Government to advance with the signing of the Heads of Terms. She added: “Much has already been achieved in terms of the scaling and prioritisation of projects, the proposed governance structures and the processes and timelines involved since the initial City Deal funding announcement. “Discussions in relation to Northern Ireland Government ‘match funding’ to the UK Government poundm Future Fund element of the funding package are continuing.” In terms of the Graduate Medical School and the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus, the council spokesperson said that these are ‘key catalyst regeneration projects’. They have been described as critical to achieving growth and prosperity for Derry and the wider North West City region. “The Mayor last week led calls for the immediate sign off on the approval and long-term commitment of funding for the Graduate Entry Medical School at Ulster University’s Magee campus. “The project has cross party support and there is widespread acknowledgement that it is a hugely important project for the city and wider North West region. “Derry City and Strabane District Council has voted unanimously on a number of occasions in support of the project, acknowledging its signicance to the North West and to Northern Ireland as a whole. “The development of the Medical School and the expansion of Magee are intrinsically linked and will contribute to the overall growth of the City Region alongside the City Deal proposals.” Meanwhile, the Department of Finance voiced its support for the establishment of a medical school in Derry saying it is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach.

Taking to Twitter the Sinn Feacutein Vice-President said: Delighted that the Executive has agreed to match fund Derry  Strabane City Deal Inclusive Future Fund of pound million transformative for Derry and the NW  goes some way to redress decades of underinvestment after years of hard work by political, community  business leaders. In a statement to the Derry News over the weekend Derry City  Strabane District Council said that ‘all project proposals’ have been submitted to the government at this stage. googletag.cmd.push It is a year since it was announced that the Derry region will receive pound million from the UK Government. Last week, deputy chair of the Northern Ireland Assembly’s economy committee Sinead Mclaughlin asked Minister Diane Dodds for an update on Derry’s City Deal. The Minister said the North West deal is ‘still being worked on’ and she ‘hopes Heads of Terms will be signed off in May or June’. She added that ‘signicant work has gone into it’. Heads of Terms is a document which sets out the terms of a commercial transaction agreed in principle between parties in the course of negotiations. googletag.cmd.push In November of last year the local council stated that this document would be signed-off within weeks. The package - pound million for the Derry and Strabane City Deal and poundm for the new Inclusive Future Fund - aims to boost the economic potential of the city and wider region. Once it is signed, work will progress on the preparation of a portfolio of outline business cases for the full range of projects, a process which will take - months. Alongside this, confirmation is needed of required revenue funding to support capital investment, in particular in relation to the proposed Graduate Entry Medical School. A spokesperson for the local council said it is continuing to engage with partners and stakeholders to progress with a pathway and timeline for bringing forward the City Deal to the next stage. All project proposals have been submitted to government at this stage and Council continues to work with Government to advance with the signing of the Heads of Terms. She added: “Much has already been achieved in terms of the scaling and prioritisation of projects, the proposed governance structures and the processes and timelines involved since the initial City Deal funding announcement. “Discussions in relation to Northern Ireland Government ‘match funding’ to the UK Government poundm Future Fund element of the funding package are continuing.” In terms of the Graduate Medical School and the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus, the council spokesperson said that these are ‘key catalyst regeneration projects’. They have been described as critical to achieving growth and prosperity for Derry and the wider North West City region. “The Mayor last week led calls for the immediate sign off on the approval and long-term commitment of funding for the Graduate Entry Medical School at Ulster University’s Magee campus. “The project has cross party support and there is widespread acknowledgement that it is a hugely important project for the city and wider North West region. “Derry City and Strabane District Council has voted unanimously on a number of occasions in support of the project, acknowledging its signicance to the North West and to Northern Ireland as a whole. “The development of the Medical School and the expansion of Magee are intrinsically linked and will contribute to the overall growth of the City Region alongside the City Deal proposals.” Meanwhile, the Department of Finance voiced its support for the establishment of a medical school in Derry saying it is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. Finance Minister, Conor Murphy hosted a meeting with representatives of the North West on April  to discuss the Magee Medical School, City Deals and the Inclusive Future Fund. Following the meeting, the Minister said: Today’s meeting was a continuation of positive engagement I’ve had over recent months with the North West. I’ve already expressed my support for the City Deal  Inclusive Future Fund which will be discussed at the Executive.

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at. Now, you can reframe it as an opportunity to work on something to get better at and when we do get backyou are a better player.” Inidual work would be aerobic fitness, increasing strength and acceleration, as well as working on technical skills. Its about getting your weak side up to a level you can use under pressure and speeding up the execution of skills. It could be something as simple as rehabbing an injury. What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement. It is something you can control and work on and measure. “There are so many things about this situation at the minute, and this is le in general, that we dont have control over. We dont know when it will end. “We have control over the small things, like washing our hands, but we have no control over when sport happens again and le gets back to normal. “It is about the things you can control right now...working on things like your touch, on your acceleration – you have complete control over these things.” “It is hugely important as we manage our emotions, as we go through this. If you are focussing on things you cant control...you are going to feel anxious, down and all those negative things.” CONNECTIONS Aside from the competitive streak, the sporting environment is one of inclusion. Dressing room banter and the slagging around training breeds a team spirit. After a stressful day at work, exercise and collective training is a welcome release. Without the regular bond, it presents a mental strain. “For our own mental health, it is so important to stay connected to people we normally connect with,” Brick stresses. It is important for team environments to still foster that togetherness, evenit is an articial way, via video conferencing. “You are apart from each other, you are doing a bit of training together but separately. That connection is massively important. “We all take part in sport because we love taking part, but we also enjoy the company of the people we take part with. Keeping that companionship and connectivity is so important. “We are physically distancing and socially isolating, but through that, it is important that we dont completely socially disconnect from other people. It only has benefits and one is for our own mental health.” To conclude, Brick highlighted an non-sport theme he has noticed with many of his students and clients. “People are taking the time to slow down to a certain extent, to reconnect with what is important in le and spend time with family. “That is a positive. We get wrapped up in our work bubble or our sport bubble, we forget about the important things.” RELATED - Derry GAA doctor on the importance of exercise. Click here...

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at. Now, you can reframe it as an opportunity to work on something to get better at and when we do get backyou are a better player.” Inidual work would be aerobic fitness, increasing strength and acceleration, as well as working on technical skills. Its about getting your weak side up to a level you can use under pressure and speeding up the execution of skills. It could be something as simple as rehabbing an injury. What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement. It is something you can control and work on and measure. “There are so many things about this situation at the minute, and this is le in general, that we dont have control over. We dont know when it will end. “We have control over the small things, like washing our hands, but we have no control over when sport happens again and le gets back to normal. “It is about the things you can control right now...working on things like your touch, on your acceleration – you have complete control over these things.” “It is hugely important as we manage our emotions, as we go through this. If you are focussing on things you cant control...you are going to feel anxious, down and all those negative things.” CONNECTIONS Aside from the competitive streak, the sporting environment is one of inclusion. Dressing room banter and the slagging around training breeds a team spirit. After a stressful day at work, exercise and collective training is a welcome release. Without the regular bond, it presents a mental strain. “For our own mental health, it is so important to stay connected to people we normally connect with,” Brick stresses. It is important for team environments to still foster that togetherness, evenit is an articial way, via video conferencing. “You are apart from each other, you are doing a bit of training together but separately. That connection is massively important. “We all take part in sport because we love taking part, but we also enjoy the company of the people we take part with. Keeping that companionship and connectivity is so important. “We are physically distancing and socially isolating, but through that, it is important that we dont completely socially disconnect from other people. It only has benefits and one is for our own mental health.” To conclude, Brick highlighted an non-sport theme he has noticed with many of his students and clients. “People are taking the time to slow down to a certain extent, to reconnect with what is important in le and spend time with family. “That is a positive. We get wrapped up in our work bubble or our sport bubble, we forget about the important things.” RELATED - Derry GAA doctor on the importance of exercise. Click here...

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

Her death on Saturday morning at Altnagelvin Hospital has left a profound sense of sadness among her friends and neighbours in the street, which she called her home for so many years. As her remains were brought to Long Tower church on Sunday evening, neighbours stopped to remember a special lady, known for her warm generosity and heart of gold. It was a journey that Bridget Carroll had made thousands of times before, to a church that became her second home. googletag.cmd.push Affectionately known as ‘Wee Bridget’ to all her family and friends, Bridget was a daily Communicant until chronic illness took hold several years ago. At every Benediction service, Holy Hour, Parish Retreat, and Stations of the Cross, Bridget could be found in her familiar seat at the back of the church. Indeed she was a particular devotee of the yearly parish retreat and loved getting the traditional new outfit for the last day. Born in Kilkenny on July , , Bridget came to live at Nazareth House in Fahan as an infant, and received her education at Nazareth House in Bishop Street. googletag.cmd.push Her first job was working in the Nazareth House care home where she loved caring for the elderly residents and listening to their stories. Bridget moved to Dublin to work in the Mater Hospital with her best friend Kathleen, and stayed in the Fair City for  years. However Bridget missed the sense of home she felt in her adopted Derry, and ed to the city where she settled into le working at a number of cafes in the town, becoming a familiar face to many. For many years she lived in the iconic Rossville Flats in the Bogside, and she was delighted when she was relocated to her new home in Bishop Street when the flats were marked for demolition. Bridget’s many friendships formed the centre of her le, always staying in touch with her childhood friend Kathleen Smith who is now living in Dublin, Rita McDaid, Monica Gransha, and Kathleen Doherty from Sunbeam Terrace. You knew she had come for a visit when you heard the doorbell ring, the door open, and her familiar voice shout out – ‘It’s only me!’ The  year old loved to have a chat and always kept up with the local news buying every local newspaper each week. Bridget was a member of many groups often giving her time as a volunteer in Termonbacca, with Cursillo, St Joseph’s Young Priests Society, as a regular chapel cleaner and a parish reader. Bridget also loved travelling and was the first to sign up for any bus runs in the parish. Her favourite run without question was to the pilgrimage site of Knock, but her trips also took her as far as Lourdes on six occasions, Fatima, Buncrana, and Lough Derg. She spoke often of her devotion to the Blessed Mother and Padre Pio, it was this faith that helped her in recent years as she battled her deteriorating health. Several years ago she moved from her flat at the bottom of Bishop Street, to Alexander House at the top of Bishop Street. Here, Bridget found a new sense to the meaning of home. She formed new friendships with the staff and fellow residents, and received dedicated and loving care around the clock. Bridget Carroll will be remembered for her straight talking, unforgettable laugh, loyal friendship and beautul spirit. She often said that even though she was not born here, she felt that she was a Derry woman at heart. Many will miss chatting to her and giving her a wave as she made her way to and from the city centre for her shopping. Bishop Street will never be the same again without her.

Tracy Morroi, who is a teacher at St Patricks Primary School in Pennyburn, was contacted by a friend who noticed the striking resemblance to her, but at first she thought it was just a coincidence. googletag.cmd.push I said Im not old enough to be in a black and white photograph, said Mrs Morroi.

The -strong group managed to raise pound, after abseiling down the Tower Museum building in Derry in the inaugural charity event at the beginning of March. Money raised from the event will go towards the pound million per year cost associated with running the le-saving Helicopter Emergency Medical Service . HEMS paramedic Jason Rosborough was among those who took part in the event and said the funds were vital to the running of the service. “As a service we rely heavily on charitable donations to keep us in the air, delivering critical care to patients who have suffered trauma throughout Northern Ireland,” said the Eglinton native. googletag.cmd.push “With the sponsorship raised for taking on this exciting challenge, we have all done our bit to raise much needed funds for Air Ambulance NI.” Earlier this year Jason told the County Derry Post why the HEMS service was so important. He said: “The helicopter means we can deliver critical care interventions to patients that they wouldn’t get unless they were in a hospital department. “We bring the hospital department to the patient and deliver those interventions that have the potential to save le.” The service operates for  hours per day,  days a week and aims to reach anywhere in Northern Ireland within  minutes. googletag.cmd.push Regular donations allow AANI to better predict income levels to keep the helicopter flying and public support for the service is vital. Deputy Chair of AANI, Ian Crowe, has encouraged people to support their membership scheme. He said: “We are so grateful to everyone who took part in the Tower Museum Abseil, I put my fear of heights aside to join in. “The event was a brilliant success for the charity and something we will run again when the time is right. As a charity we rely on the support of local people to keep our helicopter flying. “With the current absence of fundraising events such as this one, I urge anyone who can to donate online or sign up to become a Club AANI member.” Anyone interested in becoming a member can contact AANI via email at info@airambulance.org or visit the website for more information.

A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America. The important markers in the career of one of Derry’s famous sons. RELATED - Gerry McElhinney - the greatest showman. Click here...

The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America. The important markers in the career of one of Derry’s famous sons. RELATED - Gerry McElhinney - the greatest showman. Click here...

The response to the classes has been brilliant and I have kept it on, even though I am teaching PE full-time in Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.ldquoObviously with COVID- I am off work now and with no GAA or fitness classes I have more time on my hands.ldquoI put out the idea on social media on Friday morning and then spent the weekend putting together the first class to upload Monday morning.ldquoI honestly didnrsquot know what to expect really. I was thinking maybeI managed to pull in a hundred people at pound each, pound would be a reasonable target.But I have really been overwhelmed by the response.Members of her usual weekly classes in Pilates for Paula responded immediately, but her school quickly weighed in behind the effort and her many acquaintances in GAA and camogie.Despite her organisation of the fundraiser, in her words being ldquoa bit last minute, her target was realised eight-fold and she presented a cheque for pound, last week.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe it really. When I saw Instagram stories of Sophie Colgan in New York taking part, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside [the Slaughtneil camog], who has been in New Zealand for the past year, signing up, and Sarah Donnelly, the Tyrone footballer in Australia, it just shows you that the people you meet through the GAA will always support each other.Paula last year captained Clonduff to the All-Ireland club title and she has played for Down and Ulster over many years, while her husband Darren is the Down football captain.ldquoThe GAA camogie community is absolutely fabulous. They rallied around my family after Christmas and provided a lot of comfort and again the response has been phenomenal.ldquoCOVID- has challenged the family once more. Clodaghrsquos parents, my brother Darren and his we Carol, live in Coleraine and it has been very dficult for us as a family to support them. What has happened over Easter week has given us all a huge lt and we are very thankful for all that support from our GAA family.ldquoI have got a lot of messages since the last class on Friday and everyone seems to have enjoyed them. A lot had never done exercise like that and now want me to provide more classes online and keep it going for as long as we are all prevented from going back to work.ldquoI think plenty of people are finding the lockdown very tough mentally and I got that back in the messages too, about how they felt a lot more positive after doing the exercise, a lot fresher and ready to face the day.She added: ldquoThe people who supported the fundraiser have helped themselves, helped Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI Research and really supported the Gribben family.You can still contribute to Leukaemia Lymphonania Research by searching for Carol and Darren Gribbenrsquos fundraiser in aid of Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI on Facebook or follow this link https:www.facebook donate  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Delamont.jpg","title":"Delamont remains closed in lockdown  ","story":"DELAMONT Country Park outside Killyleagh is to remain closed to visitors.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has confirmed that the gates to the stunning park on the shores of Strangford Lough will not reopen, despite last weekrsquos decision by Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots to reopen Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks.The decision not to allow visitors into Delamont was taken by the leaders of the local councilrsquos main parties during a meeting held via Skype last week and has been welcomed by local councillors Billy Walker and Dermot Curran.Cllr Walker said all the party leaders agreed that is it too soon to reopen Delamont, confirming that the closure decision will be reviewed next month.ldquoThere are real concerns that allowing the public to access the country park could lead to a major surge in visitors which is not what anyone wants at this particular time. The last thing we need is for family picnics and hundreds of other visitors arriving at a time when coronavirus remains a very real and present danger, continued the Rowallane councillor.Cllr Walker described the decision to reopen forest parks as ldquopremature and said Newry, Mourne and Down Council deserved praise for keeping all its country parks closed for the time being.He added: ldquoThe closure decision is being kept under review and I believe that there is still some way to go before council-owned parks will be open to the public.ldquoThere will be people upset that Delamont remains closed, but we all have to adhere to the public advice we have been given in relation to social distancing and, where possible, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Cllr Curran said he supports the decision to keep Delamont closed and praised what he described as the local authorityrsquos ldquocourageous decision.He argued that the big danger with warmer weather and clearer evenings now here is that reopening the country park could lead to a major influx of visitors and that enforcing social distancing measures would be particularly dficult,not impossible.ldquoThere was perhaps a temptation to reopen Delamont given the decision to allow people to access Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, but the local council has stood firm, putting the safety of people front and centre and is to be applauded for doing so, said Cllr Curran.ldquoErring on the side of caution is the right thing to do at this time. It would be an awful situation to reopen the park and for someone to contract coronavirus as a result. The park will reopen at some stage, but not just now. Peoplersquos health and safety must come first.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said despite the decision by Mr Poots to reopen parks managed by the Forest Service all those that the local authority is responsible for, including Delamont, will remain closed.Council officials say that the decision to close Delamont taken on March  remains in place for the time being, but will be reviewed as public health advice guidance develops.ldquoMembers decided that it was too soon to consider reopening parks at this time, said a council spokesman.In addition, he said it was felt that reopening local authority-owned country park would encourageresidents from outside the district to make a non-essential journey to these facilities for exercise, thus increasing the volume of traffic and congestion at these locations and increasing the risk of further spread of COVID- across the district.ldquoThe focus of the council at this time must be the safety of our citizens and implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, said the spokesman.ldquoThe council continues to advise our citizens that the single most important action they can take is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Doreen.jpg","title":"Doreen to step down after 20 years as leader at Leitrim playgroup  ","story":"A LEITRIM woman, who has been the driving force behind a local playgroup for almost  years, is stepping down.Doreen Shahmohammadi is a familiar face around the village, especially to young people as the leader of Leitrim Community Playgroup.Doreen, her Iranian husband, Reza, and twin sons, Michael and Colm, settled in Leitrim a few years before she began the playgroup in January . She soon experienced a strong sense of community and friendship that has kept them there ever since.She started the playgroup with the support of the local GAA club, Liatroim Fontenoys, which offered her use of their premises to begin with.ldquoIn the first year we went from having five children to  children, she said. ldquoWe had no funding in the first year, but the Fontenoys were very good to us by covering the cost of heating and telephone charges.ldquoBy the second year funding was made available by the Southern Education and Library Board for  pre-school places and it wasnrsquot long before we secured funding to build a purpose-built playgroup which sits within the boundary of the Fontenoys club.ldquoWithin a few years and thanks to additional funding enrolment rose to  places. Depending on the birth rate it has usually remains around the same number each year.Doreen loves to have children around her. In fact, Reza reminds her all the time that she is a magnet in attracting them wherever she goes.Doreen is a very proud mother. Her sons, now , graduated as doctors five years ago and both are working on the frontline during the COVID- pandemic. Colm is working in intensive care, while Michael works between cardiology and intensive care.ldquoOver the years, I have loved, cared for and educated every child that has come to the playgroup as though they were my own children, he says.ldquoI am going to miss them all very much, more than you can ever imagine. I hope Irsquom not to be a stranger to the playgroup after my retirement.Doreen says the current playgroup team, made up of deputy leader Michelle McCabe and temporary assistant, Danielle Clarke, have worked well together over the past few years. Other long term members of staff were Janet King, Tina Owens and Diane Baxter.ldquoThe playgroup has been my le and I have enjoyed welcoming hundreds of children to their pre-school year experience. It is a lovely learning environment to be part of, she continued.ldquoWe are blessed with the children and their families in the community who have entered our setting and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and committees past and present, children, grandparents, childminders and, of course, the wider community who have supported me and who have been so generous over the years.ldquoMost of all, I would like to thank the trustees who have supported me for all these years and provided me with the opportunity to establish an excellent learning environment for pre-school children, not forgetting my sincere thanks to the Fontenoys for all their support and encouragement.She added: ldquoI wish my successor every success and I hope they will enjoy and appreciate every single minute they spend with the children as I have done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Life.jpg","title":"Ex Drumaness man praises Kiwis as country comes out of lockdown  ","story":"A FORMER Drumaness man who has been living in New Zealand for the past  years has this week revealed what le in lockdown has been like Down Under.Barry Brennanrsquos adopted homeland has been praised for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the country this week emerging from a strict five-week quarantine which included the strictest constraints paced on New Zealanders in modern history.The countryrsquos prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, hailed New Zealanders for their incredible work to ldquobreak the virusrsquos chain of transmission which has allowed the country to downgrade its highest alert level from four to three, with amendedrestrictions expected to be in place for around two more weeks.The move means that many shops have reopened while public gatherings of  people are now permissible for weddings and funerals, with schools also set to reopen. In addition, Kiwis can now fish, hunt, surf, swim and play golf.New Zealand has suffered only , confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths after moving quickly to impose a lockdown last month, with the easing of quarantine measures paving the way for around , people toto work under a more relaxed regime.Barry mdash who specialises in home renovations and employs several people mdash has not ed to work yet, but is more than happy in the idyllic rural setting of Mangawhai in the North Island just five minutes from the beach, where he lives with his we, Sian, and children Sean, Danny and Liam.The New Zealand government is still asking citizens to stay at home and to practise social distancing, with Barry hoping that it wonrsquot be long before the country again enjoys some sense of normality.And he has the praised prime minister for her approach to COVID-, with Arden arguing that a drastic short-term action would benefit the countryrsquos economy in the long run.On Monday, it was confirmed that there is no widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand, with Ms Arden warning that the country was not yet out of the woods.ldquoWhen you look at what happened where in the world in relation to coronavirus, the prime minister did a good job, said Barry, who headed to New Zealand with his friend Barry Armstrong in .ldquoI was a qualied carpenter and Barry, who lived just up the road from me, was a bricklayer who had a contact in New Zealand so we headed off on a -month visa to Auckland. Barry stayed for  months before heading home but I am still here, married with three boys.ldquoThe coronavirus has had a worldwide impact and while many people were wondering what would happen in New Zealand, I always had a feeling that the prime minister would go at the pandemic hard and fast and that is exactly what she did.Barry revealed that New Zealanders were told to prepare for lockdown on March  and that two days later a series of strict measures were introduced.ldquoClearly the prime minister had a look at what was happening in other parts of the world before the virus got a hold here and she moved to minimise its impact. I think that she has done an amazing job to be quite honest.ldquoFour and a half weeks after the lockdown measures were implemented, there was only one confirmed coronavirus case in New Zealand at the start of this week. Indeed, the government knows exactly where every case is in the country.Barry said anyone arriving in the country and is suspected of having the virus is quarantined and believes thatthere was ever to be another pandemic in the future, countries would do well to take a close look at what New Zealand did to halt its deadly spread.ldquoEverything really happened so fast here and we did not have that much time to think about what was going in, he continued.ldquoI played golf with the principal of the school my youngest boy attends and he said he did not think NewZealand would go into lockdown. Forty eight hours later we were told it was happening.Barry said the country rightly decided that it wasnrsquot taking any chances and locked everything down, apart from supermarkets, with strict social distancing rules in place.ldquoWe have gone from a level four alert to level three but I am still not back at work as there a lot of iables that I need to consider, explained the former Drumaness man. ldquoIn my line of work I would be close to homeowners so I will just wait until the restrictions ease a bit more.Barry relocated from Auckland to Mangawhai six years ago and home is now a three and a half acre plot where he built a shooting gallery and what he describes as a ldquobit of a golf course. He also looks after a few animals.With no immediateto work on the horizon, Barry is keeping busy mowing lawns and feeding his animals, with a little help from his sons.With his parents, Sean and Mary, still living at the family home at the Cumber Road in Drumaness, Barry says he is in regular contact with them. He said his dad is good with Whatsapp and regularly tells him that New Zealand lamb is cheaper in Ireland than down under.ldquoWe have lots of contact with my parents and are in touch once or twice a week. I also have an older brother, Seamus who lives in Auckland. We both played for Loughinisland GAC. I also keep up-to-date with what is going there via social media and stuff, he continued.ldquoMy brother, Mark, is a former Loughinisland club chairman who was involved in the plans for building the new clubhouse. I also keep tabs on Down GAArsquos fortunes.As Barry waits for the right time toto work, he said that during the lockdown, New Zealanders mostly did what they were told.He added: ldquoThey were sensible and the approach has worked as things are slowly ing to normal, but we know that we have a little way to go yet..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 29%2C 1980  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash A new library for Newcastle is to be given priority soon by the South Eastern Education Board, it was claimed this week.The claim came from Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, who said she believed that Board members realised they had made a bad mistake and are now prepared to reverse their attitude.Mrs Smyth, addressing a meeting of Down councillors on Monday, explained that she had recently asked the Board for an undertaking that the Newcastle Library project would be given a priority rating for new capital schemes.ldquoI think the whole Board realised they made a bad mistake and they are quite willing to go ahead and get something done quickly, said Mrs Smyth.Mrs Smyth made her surprise announcement after Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue attacked the Boardrsquos attitude over a new library for the seaside town.Mr OrsquoDonoghue claimed that an original Board decision to put Newcastle on a low priority rating was taken without consulting the Boardrsquos chief librarian who was in favour of early attention for Newcastle.He called the lack of consultation and criticised the Board for not responding fully to points raised by a council deputation several months ago.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce is beginning to draw up plans for another trade week ndash and such was the success of the last venture that itrsquos been decided to extend this yearrsquos event to ten days.The dates being set aside for the trade week are Thursday, June th to Saturday, June st, and it is hoped that the townrsquos traders will offer many bargains to help attract business.Last yearrsquos trade week was a major success and most businesses in the town have reaped the benefit since. New customers were attracted to the town and quality goods and competitive prices have encouraged many toon a regular basis.The growing stature of the town as a shopping centre has been helped by the introduction of new shops, particularly in the Dromore Street area, and by the good car parking facilities on offer.Market Day every Thursday brings hundreds of people from the surrounding district flooding into the town ndash and with two Market Days cropping up in the new extended trade week this year, the Chamber is hopeful that shopping will hit a new peak in June.QUOILE ndash A concerted effort is being made by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Down District Council to make the -mile stretch of the Quoile River into a fishing paradise.Regarded as one of the best fishing waters in the province, the Quoile is hardly known nationally, and itrsquos the aim of the Tourist Board and the council to make it as popular as the Fermanagh Lakelands, the current number one fishing haven.The joint effort to put the Quoile on the fishing map is being spearheaded by Ian Heaps, the former inidual world champion angler and current member of the English international team, who has been carrying out a survey over the past ten days.And his report could influence the Tourist Board to pump more money into publicising the Quoile to world-wide anglers.Already Heaps has spent ten days fishing the Quoile and its ancillary waters ndash and his expert opinion is that itrsquos one of the best that Northern Ireland has to offer.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Vikings ed to invade Killyleagh this week ndash but this time it was a more peaceful visit.The invaders, instead of arriving by longship to pillage and plunder, came to look over youth provision in the area and they left totally impressed by the friendly reception they received.The unlikely invaders were a group of youth workers from Norway and Spain, who visited the area as part of a five-day study of youth work and facilities in the province.Local stops were at the Seaboard Sailing Centre in Killyleagh, Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Castlewellan and Downpatrick Folk Club.Tuesday afternoon and night was spent in the area, with the first stop for the Norwegians being at the Seaboard centre.STRANGFORD ndash The recently formed Strangford Village Improvement Committee is to seek public support to have an order enforcing the one-way system in the village revoked.The committee discussed the system at their monthly meeting on Thursday and, after hearing of the failure of a meeting between the Department of Environment officials, traffic police and RUC representatives to have something done about it, they decided that the support of the public is needed.The committee chairman told members that the top level meeting had fallen on deaf ears and that nothing could be done about the situation.They had discussed the possibility of altering the system, the ious proposals which the committee had made as alternatives to it, and the fact that the majority of residents did not want the system.Unfortunately the Department rejected all the committeersquos proposals and insisted that the system, in its present form, would have to remain, said the chairman.The chairman had askedthe one-way system would not be made permanent until all attempts to accommodate the residentrsquos wishes had been made but the Department replied that the systemis already permanentand had been made so by Government order.

The online sales are set to continue as marts across the province begin to reopen.Cllr Lewis said the marts have a crucial role to play, allowing farmers to buy and sell livestock, at what is a traditionally a busy time of the year for them. Crucially, he said reopening marts will help with their respective incomes.He said there was ldquosignicant concern when the marts closed last month, with farmers expressing concern that they could find themselves overstocked with animals, particularly store cattle and ped calves.ldquoNews of the gradual reopening of local marts is an important development and will be widely welcomed across the agricultural sector at this time, said Cllr Lewis.The Slieve Croob councillor said DAERA was to be applauded for its decision, particularly given the key role farmers play in supplying the local food chain.ldquoIt is essential that in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public, he continued.ldquoAt this time of year, many farmers are seeking to purchase stock for the grazing season and obviously others are selling their stock through the marts. Dairy farms will also find themselves overstocked with dropped calves that they would normally be selling.Cllr Lewis said there were farmers wishing to sell and buy livestock and it was ldquovital in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public.A DAERA spokesman said farmers were key workers and were continuing to provide food for everyone in ldquovery challenging circumstances with part of the food supply chain the ability to trade and sell animals.ldquoStaff within the department have maintained regular contact with livestock mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements, he continued.ldquoFarmers, like all businesses, are facing financial dficulties as a result of COVID-.

In many ways, itrsquos strange to think that by staying home I can save a le.My sister, Martina, loved le, but she was only  when she passed away in . Seasonal flu was the culprit which overwhelmed her body. COVID- is a frightening virus for the world to contend with. But it is especially frightening for people like me.Martina and I were born with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle wasting condition which robs people of the ability to walk, eat and breathe.I now live an active, productive le, thanks to many interventions that started in my childhood. I had a tube ed into my stomach to ensure that I could get the nutrients I could no longer eat as half of the muscles I use to swallow became paralysed. I also began using a non-invasive ventilator.COVID- has been on our radar since the beginning of January. I could do little but watch and wait. The plans would not be much dferent than my usual flu-time plans which ensure that I am in protective bubble, which allows my family to do everything it can to maintain an infection-free environment around me.Sure enough, almost  days ago, it was time to take action, with the Hollywood lockdown coming almost two weeks before it was implemented for everyone . And within a few days of the official lockdown beginning, I was also furloughed from work at a leading charity for people with conditions like mine.This has been one of the most emotionally and mentally dficult parts of the pandemic for me personally. Since I was  I have been working with and for this charity to improve lives. But within a few short days my le had drastically changed.Last September, I took eight flights in three weeks as I was selected for an Emerging Leaders programme by the US State Department for my work with disabled people and for a national conference for people with conditions like mine in London.Now, I have to stay within the bounds of my driveway. I can only go outside because my neighbours are all so far away. A small mercy.It quickly became obvious that getting food and other essential supplies was not going to be easy. Large supermarkets only started offering registration to extremely vulnerable customers a few weeks in to the lockdown.Before lockdown began few,any supermarkets offered a dedicated shopping time to extremely vulnerable customers, making getting food dficult during a time when it was flying off the shelves in panic buying.Crossgarrsquos SuperValu store got us through those first few weeks as it was able to deliver some essentials, while Gordons Pharmacy in Downpatrick has been delivering to us for some time now. But the pharmacyrsquos willingness to collect our preions has been a huge weight off our shoulders.I have now been able to register the family with Sainsburyrsquos for deliveries of other items we need to keep us ticking over, while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos food delivery package service has been much more successful than those in other parts of the UK.The one that we have received included food that I could eat ndash something many of my friends in the rest of the UK are not so lucky with. The parcel is one small, yet very important part of the support our government is offering that it has got right, even though it has only been in place for us for three weeks.It took us several weeks to set up everything we needed, but I know that many others are still trying and are having to take drastic, le-endangering measures to keep it going.However, COVID- is not just a negative in the lives of disabled people.Virtual concerts, musicals on YouTube for all and even online quiz nights have become the new normal of socialising.Many jobs and educational institutions have moved staff to work from home and online, something that some disabled people were often refused when they asked for it. Even the community spirit and volunteering has left us feeling overwhelmed with offers of help.It is my hope that we can use this opportunity to see what our future can be.A more accepting and inclusive society, where disabled people can fully take part. Creative thinking mdash both economic and social mdash have taken a cannonball to the social infrastructure that was a climbing wall and turned it into an accessible lt.I want us all to realise how positive this can be for society and act upon it, even when the pandemic is over..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Laura.jpg","title":"Laura takes chair  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN woman Laura Devlin is to become the districtrsquos new first citizen.The Mournes SDLP councillor is set to take over at the helm of Newry, Mourne and Down Council when the local authority holds its annual meeting next month.Cllr Devlin will replace Sinn Feinrsquos Charlie Casey in the council hot seat, while two Ulster Unionist councillors mdash Robert Burgess and Harold McKee mdash are in the running for the councilrsquos deputy position.She was chosen as her partyrsquos nomination for the top council post last week, with the councilrsquos Ulster Unionist members set to confirm shortly their preferred choice for the vice-chairmanrsquos position.Cllr Devlin has been a member of the SDLP since  and is a highly respected politician who was co-opted to replace Eamonn OrsquoNeill on the former Down Council in .With her position as the new council chairman confirmed, all eyes are on the UUP to see which councillor the party will pick to be her deputy.Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis and Slieve Gullionrsquos David Taylor have ruled themselves out of the running for the post due to work commitments, leaving it a straight fight between Cllr Burgess and Cllr McKee, two of the UUPrsquos most experienced councillors.Cllr Burgess is a former Down Council chairman and is also the current chairman of the Ulster Farmersrsquo Unionrsquos Co Down Branch, while Cllr McKee was a former South Down MLA and member of Newry and Mourne Council.The annual meeting is traditionally held in the debating chamber at the local authorityrsquos Downshire Civic Centre in Downpatrick, but alternative venues are currently being examined to comply with social distancing guidelines in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.The council debating chamber is not large enough to ensure that the districtrsquos  councillors, council staff and the media can safely stay two metres apart.The Recorder understands that several options are being explored on the way forward, with a formal announcement expected shortly.Down Leisure Centre, which is currently closed to the public, has been touted as a possible base for the annual meeting, with proceedings taking place in the expansive four court sports hall on the first floor.It is being suggested that the large area would allow councillors, officers and the media to comfortably comply with social distancing legislation.An alternative suggestion which some councillors believe could be a potential runner is an annual meeting attended by just the leaders of the councilrsquos main parties and the leader of the Independent members.Ahead of the AGM, the main parties have already selected which councillors will be appointed to the local authorityrsquos ious statutory committees and who will fill the top two positions on each.And, in keeping with public health advice to maintain social distancing, it is understood that the formal ceremony to present the new chairman with the chain of office will also not take place.

Unfortunately after all of the hard work of labour, I had to have a C-section and James Patrick was born at .pm on Tuesday. Ryan was allowed into the recovery room with me for two hours, but after that he didnrsquot see me or the baby until Thursday afternoon when we were allowed home.Prospective parents have been told that only one birth partner is currently allowed into the delivery ward, but onlythey are well and show no signs of coronavirus.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoApart from the labour and the C-section, it was a positive experience. I think I was more anxious in the days coming up to the birth as I didnrsquot know what the restrictions would mean. In hindsight, it wasnrsquot that bad and it was probably worse for Ryan sitting at home. He rang his sister who has four children and asked when she thought he could do and she said clean the house.Baby James Patrick was only one day overdue, but Mrs Lawlor was delighted that he decided to make an appearance when he did. A clue to his birth weight may be due to his mother being ft  inches tall, while dad Ryanis ft  inches.While Mrs Lawlor did not have to wear a face mask during her labour, but the midwives who attended her afterwards were masked.She said: ldquoI suppose as this was an all-new experience for both Ryan and I we have nothing to compare it to.ldquoI remember waking up the next day, not that I slept that much in the night, and thought, lsquoOh no, I have a whole day by myself in here with this brand new babyrsquo. But the nurses and midwives are coming that often to do a iety of checks that the days went quite fast.ldquoHowever, I remember that I felt the second night in hospital was awfully long and I really struggled with dealing with James. Normally,you have a bit of help during the day and night, you can manage better to get a bit of sleep.ldquoThe strangest thing was seeing quite a few of the staff with masks and visors on. While they were all lovely, you lost a bit of the personal touch and connection with them because of the masks. Sometimesthey were maintaining social distancing and werenrsquot close to you, you couldnrsquot actually see who it was. The staff were all wonderful but you didnrsquot know what they looked like.As a sportswoman, who used to play for Loughinisland GACrsquos senior ladies and at county level, Mrs Lawlor is recovering well after the birth. Her husband is also well-known in local sporting circles as hersquos on the executive committee of Loughinisland GAC.They are becoming accustomed to the lsquonewrsquo normal at home of being first-time parents amid the lockdown.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoWe have had visitors to the house looking through the window at the baby. Itrsquos still hard for everyone as my sister is itching to get a wee cuddle and all our family members want to hold him. That canrsquot happen for very good reasons and I donrsquot know when that will change. Thatrsquos one of the strange things about having a baby in the lockdown.ldquoHowever, the simplicity of le today is quite nice. I think itrsquos possibly the best time to have a baby. We have plenty to keep ourselves busy with James Patrick in the lockdown and therersquos nothing  to distract us. Ryan is a self-employed plumber andit wasnrsquot for the lockdown, he probably would have been ing to work sooner so itrsquos good for us to have this time together..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Not.jpg","title":"Paddy Mo’s greatest Down side of all time  ","story":"p.pp.pspan.s Paddy Doherty was a key member of the historic Down All-Ireland-winning team of . In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry athlete takes lockdown in her stride  ","story":"CIARA Mageeanrsquos Olympic ambitions may have been put on hold owing to coronavirus, but shersquos taking the lockdown in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig.

Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room!

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Enormous enough to make it fairly easy to persuade businesses to close down, flights to remain grounded, schools and universities to shut until the autumn and millions of people to stay inside for ‘however long it takes’. And for the first few weeks a combination of novelty and surprisingly good weather, along with promises from the government to pay salaries and pick up the other tabs, was enough to fuel a sense of calm and reassurance.But within a couple of weeks it was becoming obvious that prolonged confinement was taking a huge physical and psychological toll. Most of us live in an average-sized house with an average-sized garden fine and dandy for most of the time, yet claustrophobically small when the entire family is stuck in them  . People exercise on a seafront promenade in Barcelona at the weekend after the Spanish government eased its lockdown restrictions \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Social media, Skype, mobile phones, TV box-sets, Netflix and computer games provided distraction at the start of the lockdown but when distraction becomes the norm it raises all sorts of other problems. Those distractions were the go-to for previous periods of boredom, but what do we do when even the distractions have become boring  Other worries also begin to set in. We all need space and we all need down-time. When we are denied them then anger and irritation take hold. Usually healthy relationships are put under tremendous stress. Adults grow increasingly concerned about their jobs. University students miss their le away from home. Younger children miss their school friends. All of them miss other aspects of their le which used to be taken for granted. Bundle all of that stress into one package in a small house and you can understand why mental health experts believe that millions of us are dealing with real anguish right now – and unable to find an outlet for it.That’s why governments are desperately trying to find a way of allowing people outside again as soon as is possible. The paradox they are dealing with is a particularly dficult one. The death rate is much lower than originally predicted, so people are asking why they are still confined to home. Butyou let too many people out, too soon, those death rates could soar. Yetyou continue to keep people indoors and most businesses remain closed then the chances of economic collapsealso soar. So, what does a government do Most of them seem to be opting for the bit-by-bit approach, with each new bit depending on the success of the bit that preceded it. A few days ago Leo Varadkar set out a timetable for easing the lockdown in the Republic and Boris Johnson is making a similar announcement later this week for the United Kingdom. But Varadkar’s proposals are still quite cautious and evenall goes according to plan some of the restrictions associated with lockdown and social distancing will remain in place for an unspecied period.That’s because all governments are terried of a‘second wave’ in a few months time because they know that once you ease restrictions and allow people to ‘ to normal’ complacency will set in. Which means that the mask will, quite literally, slip. A few weeks ago the vast majority of us were either terried or, at the very least, genuinely concerned about the risks associated with CV-. We believed it could kill us or seriously debilitate us. No surprise, then, that we hid from it and did what was necessary to avoid coming into contact with it.I’m pretty sure the majority is no longer terried by it indeed most people are probably no longer even genuinely concerned by it. We don’t fear it anymore and we don’t feel the need to hide from it. So being told that it could be still be weeks before most of us are allowed toto something resembling normalis going to be a very hard sell.The other key problem governments face is what they dothe bit-by-bit approach fails and the second wave still comes in a few months time – threatening to overwhelm health services, forcing businesses to close again and requiring millions of us to accept a lockdown which may be even more restrictive than the present one . There is a lot to be said for building hope and providing people with a light at the end of the tunnel. But  hope, built on maybes, is a dangerous path to tread. Making it easier for people to leave their homes for longer periods is important, but should not be done until there is a very clear strategy for mass testing and monitoring. Also, we need fairly cast-iron guarantees that complacency can be controlled, social distancing enforced and restrictions reimposed very quicklynecessary.Three other problems: there still isn’t a vaccine ready to roll out there is no certainty that once you’ve had Covid- you won’t get it again and, so far, there is no guarantee that a second wave is actually avoidable. One thing we do know, though: it will still be a long time before we can talk of le being ‘normal’ again. Personally, I think what we’ve learned from this experience means that the old ‘normal’ has gone and we’ll learn to live with a new ‘normal’. Which, to be honest, is maybe no bad thing.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...I like to think that family le in the wider sense in Northern Ireland is treasured. Being of the baby boomer generation I do remember – just about – those years after the World War Two when my mother’s greatest treasure was her ration books or a visit from a spinster aunt who brought the treats we couldn’t otherwise afford. My aunt, , may have longed for a family of her own but we never knew or asked why she hadn’t married. I wish she was around today because her attention to us taught me, even though I was very young, the value of close family connections and the fact that our parents weren’t the only ones who loved us.I have several nephews and nieces now and I’ve tried to be a caring aunt, but it’s been dficult since I was a full time working mum and had to concentrate on my own children whilst not at work. By the time my children had taken up careers in other countries I tried to concentrate on the nephews and nieces but time was still always against me and they too were scattered to the winds.I have had to wait to what I call my ageing period to make any inroads into my relationships with them and being able to see them even only occasionally is a pleasure. But not now, with this lockdown thwarting me all the way. Family visits are out of the question as my sister reminded me in the early lockdown days when I was sure the odd visit wouldn’t matter. I’ve been fully in lockdown now for what seems an age.I’m certain that is what has revived my old back pain, my occasional bouts of insomnia and has left me looking much older than I should. Definitely. You see it’s not entirely family I’m missing - it’s the hairdresser, the chiropodist, the dentist, the dog groomer , my friends who live near and far, going to the shops and the prospect of not being able to pay a visit to my children and grandchildren - all of whom live in Europe. Boat or plane, it doesn’t matter, neither is available to take me there and equally they can’t come here. I think loneliness may be setting in.Himself is showing signs of impatience – that’s not how I describe myself – because, at this time of year, he would be preparing his boat for the summer sailing season. It sits, alongside a few dozen other boats, wonderingit will get it’s bottom scrubbed and anti-fouled this year before being released into the water amidst cheers of ship-ahoy and back slapping from the launching team.Being deprived of this ritual as, at the time of writing, marinas and harbours throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland - north and south, are closed, is seriously bad for the old-salts brigade. All they can do is look out to sea and pray.We are well warned not to rush out of lockdown but a surprising number of people have run out of patience – not my generation I’m certain – with a sense of entitlement that puts everyone  at risk.One newspaper headline this week declared that ‘lockdown for a year would be a crippling economic blow’. The experts tell us it could cause a second ‘large and deadly peak’. Not attractive choices at all. We can do without those scenarios.Maybe it’s lethargy setting in, but I haven’t got round to ordering food on line as I’m happy enough with our corner shop, I’ll have to leave my hair to grow in its own unwieldly fashion and I don’t intend to fall out with the dog over grooming. The gypsy look will have to do.--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with.

This will highlight the importance of community testing and support the containment of emerging coronavirus infections as and when restrictions are eased.Launching the framework, the First Minister said: ldquoOur approach to date has been one of lockdown. We have taken unprecedented steps to protect everyone, but particularly those most at risk from serious illness.ldquoThis has helped the NHS prepare and cope with coronavirus and, even though we have sadly seen more than  people die, it has helped to save many more lives. But this strategy comes with its own costs to peoplersquos wider health and wellbeing and long-term costs to our economy.ldquoWe are keeping these regulations under constant review. We know coronavirus will be with us for a long time yet but we want to see whether there are things we can do while we continue to tackle the virus and while the search for better treatments and a vaccine continue.The framework ndash and the seven questions ndash will help determine when the time is right to relax some of the stay-at home regulations.The seven questions are:bull Would easing a restriction have a negative effect on containing the virus bull Does a particular measure pose a low risk of further infection bull How can it be monitored and enforced bull Can it be reversed quicklyit creates unintended consequences bull Does it have a positive economic benefit bull Does it have a positive impact on peoplersquos wellbeing bull Does it have a positive impact on equality The Chief Medical Officer for Walesrsquo office has developed the Wales-wide programme of surveillance, case identication, and contract tracing.It will have four main strands ndash improved surveillance of cases of coronavirus effective identication of cases and contact tracing learning from international experience and engaging with the public.Dr Atherton said: ldquoAction to ease the lockdown restrictions will need to be supported by a comprehensive public health response, which will need to developed quickly and at scale.ldquoAcross the UK, we have worked and put in place unprecedented measures to contain and delay the spread of coronavirus. We have also worked to reduce the overall impact of the virus by strengthening essential services, including healthcare.ldquoWe are now working towards a new recovery phase to lead us out of the pandemic but only when the conditions are right.The First Minister added: ldquoCoronavirus is not going to disappear ndash it is likely it will be with us for a long time. We will need to have some sort of restrictions in place for some time yet to continue to control the spread of the virus and reduce community transmission. This framework will help us determine what is right for Wales.ldquoThere is a long road ahead of us towards recovery to pre-pandemic levels, butwe continue to work together, I hope we will be able to make changes to the restrictions and see a gradualto something resembling normal le.The Welsh Government has worked closely with the rest of the UK throughout the pandemic and has shared the development of the framework with the Scottish, Northern Irish and the UK governments. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...
