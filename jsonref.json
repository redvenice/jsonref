Mr Freeman arrives for the case management hearing at Wimbledon Magistrates\u0027 Court todayBut the letter was not received until more than the legal time limit of two weeks after the alleged offence on January 23, Mr Freeman said.The court heard the letter, which was dated February 2, was not received by Bentley until February 7.

I accept the date on it is the 2nd. As I understand it that\u0027s the date it was printed. Not the date it was served.\u0027Mr Freeman added: \u0027What I\u0027m saying is the notice is defective because it arrived out of time.\u0027  The court was told a stamp to indicate receipt  was dated February 7.          David Beckham is pictured driving a Bentley car (not believed to be the one involved in the incident in January) through West London with his 19-year-old son Brooklyn last monthSimon Maughan, prosecuting, said: \u0027I\u0027m accepting of the letter, I\u0027m accepting of the date on the letter, I\u0027m accepting that the seventh has been stamped on the letter.           Beckham (pictured in Monaco last Thursday) did not attend the court hearing today\u0027There can be no issue with the date on the letter.\u0027 Beckham, of Holland Park, West London, allegedly broke the limit while driving on the A40 flyover in Paddington.District Judge Barbara Barnes said: \u0027I will fix the trial date on September 27.\u0027Referring to the punishment if Beckham is found guilty, she said: \u0027I think we\u0027re in unlimited fines territory.\u0027She added: \u0027Service of the intended prosecution should be received within 14 days. The defence say it was outside 14 days.\u0027Asked whether Beckham would be present at the trial, Mr Freeman said: \u0027I don\u0027t anticipate it.\u0027He added: \u0027If the case goes against him and if the result is disqualification then I will make it absolutely clear.\u0027          David Beckham, pictured with his wife Victoria before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding in Windsor in May, denies the speeding charge which dates back to JanuaryBeckham also did not attend an earlier hearing at Lavender Hill Magistrates\u0027 Court in Battersea on August 28.According to the charge sheet on that date, he sent his not guilty plea by post on August 17.Beckham made his name as a midfielder at Manchester United in the 1990s before going on to play for Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain.He also earned 115 caps for the national side. He retired from playing in 2013. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/14/4F7F06EB00000578-0-Emotional_Kim_broke_down_in_tears_as_she_accused_Coleen_of_makin-a-16_1536152559883.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER unfortunate minutes TV turned witch hunt","story":"    Emotional: Kim broke down in tears as she accused Coleen of making her life \u0027hell\u0027 and bullying her during their time in the CBB houseJANET STREET-PORTER: Kim, Coleen and me and how an...How Lynda Bellingham begged her husband to marry again:...Share this articleThe abuse that Coleen has endured has shocked even me - someone who can give as good as she gets. Coleen’s crime - if you can describe it as that - was to appear on Loose Women a week ago alongside her nemesis from Celebrity Big Brother, Kim Woodburn, to try and settle their differences. I reluctantly agreed to mediate - and, (unwisely, in retrospect) - agreed to emulate Judge Rinder and put on a black robe.It was supposed to be a light-hearted bit of fun, and Kim was happy to come on the show, for which she received a decent fee. To put the record straight, Kim Woodburn and I have never fallen out - she’s not everyone’s cup of tea, and (like me) she isn’t afraid to speak her mind. During her last appearance on Loose Women, we got on fine.          Two-faced: Things had escalated on the show, as the pair discussed their past together, with Coleen admitting: \u0027I think Kim\u0027s right I was two-faced with Kim in the house,\u0027This time, however, the chat got off to a rocky start, with Kim immediately accusing the totally innocent Linda Robson of siding with Coleen. What followed, was unreal - in all my 40 years of television, I’ve never encountered someone like Kim who defies all reason, who started ranting, convinced she was being attacked, and would not draw breath. I could do little to stem the tirade - if you watch the show that’s obvious. I’m hardly colluding in verbal abuse. Kim eventually stormed off after deciding to introduce her troubled childhood into the discussion. Coleen (who also, by the way, had an extremely difficult childhood) barely said a word.          Shocking: Kim Woodburn and Coleen Nolan proved their feud was still going strong as they had an almighty row during Wednesday\u0027s episode of Loose WomenAfterwards, we sat in a meeting room in total shock. The breakdown in communication between the presenters and our guest was bad enough - but what followed on social media was truly insane, and didn’t reflect (in my opinion) what actually happened. Coleen has been accused of being a bully, of gloating (and worse). She’s received death threats and has been trolled by small minded idiots who say they hope she dies of cancer like her sister Bernie. Even more bizarre, a petition has been launched to try and get Coleen sacked from Loose Women, signed by thousands who haven’t even watched the interview.I’ve been told I am a bully and that my reputation is in tatters, and slagged off by high minded newspapers like the Guardian - who seem desperate to join in the storm. The effect on Coleen has been devastating - a day afterwards, she texted me to say she’d been crying non-stop. Yesterday she appeared on ITV’s This Morning, still barely able to talk through the tears.  Shocked: The pensioner went on to accuse the audience of \u0027laughing\u0027 at her, as she spat: \u0027Look you folks can laugh all you want. I\u0027m going to tell you something now and then I\u0027m going to leave\u0027As Coleen has said, this storm is truly shocking - and hard to understand. She (and all the Loose Women) have fronted well-received campaigns to highlight mental health and body confidence, and the show won Best Entertainment show at the Mind Media Awards. Last year, Coleen, Linda and I stripped off for a billboard campaign to persuade other women that whatever shape you are, it’s OK. When I joined Loose Women seven years ago, Coleen was a friendly face. It was a challenging experience, a bit like starting at a new school. Trying to find a way to fit into a gang of old mates, who had been around for ages wasn’t easy. Coleen extended me a warm welcome and was always supportive.To see her go through the recent breakdown of her marriage, and still go on screen being a strong woman who is there for other women, has been inspiring. She represents everything I am very bad at - close family relationships and empathy, laced with a strong dose of down to earth common sense and life experience.          TRASH! Shaking her finger at Coleen, Kim then angrily shouted out \u0027She is trash\u0027, as she stormed out the studio, ignoring Janet Street-Porter call out \u0027She\u0027s not trash\u0027Coleen and Kim have never seen eye to eye - but Coleen is not a spiteful or revengeful person, all of which makes her current predicament so incomprehensible. A woman who has publicly talked about her grief over the death of one sister and is coping with the serious health issues faced by another is hardly unsympathetic. A woman who has talked candidly about a violent father who sexually abused her sister Anne. Coleen understands the tough side of life - and, at the age of 53 - has decided to go back on tour - alone. She says she wants to ‘take control’ of her life, to reassess things, now that she’s a single woman again.To put the record straight, Coleen Nolan is not a bully - and neither am I. I’m proud she’s my friend, and shame on those people who want to hurt her. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/19/4F7767D900000578-6135549-image-a-9_1536172902949.jpg","title":"Greggs release Pumpkin Spice Latte bid rival Starbucks","story":"    Greggs is hoping to rival is hoping to rival Starbucks autumnal supremacy by releasing a cheaper version of the beverageThere is even the opportunity for people to try the new drink for free if they register on the Greggs Rewards app.At £2.20, Greggs’s drink is nearly a pound cheaper than the Starbucks version, with its venti size PSL going for £3.15 in the UK. Greggs’s larger 16oz drink will go on sale at £2.50.In regards to the flavour, Greggs says that the beverage will be made from freshly-ground coffee, steamed milk and ‘sweet pumpkin flavour syrup’ topped with cream and a shortbread crumb.The original Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte recipe included Starbucks Espresso Roast, pumpkin pie-flavoured sauce and steamed milk, topped with whipped cream and pumpkin pie spices including cinnamon, nutmeg and clove.However, there is a new Starbucks version for 2018, which caters to vegan requirements. The company’s beverage can now be made with almond and coconut milk instead of cow milk, and its baristas claim the change doesn’t alter the taste.          Starbucks already released their PSL in the US, which many thought was too earlyAnother difference between the two companies drinks is the calorie count. According to the Sun, Greggs’s regular Pumpkin Spice Latte comes in at 240 calories while Starbucks’s hits 383 calories.Greggs is releasing its PSL version on the same day as Starbucks rolls its own out across Europe.However, Starbucks, which has already released the Pumpkin Spice Latte in the US, has also introduced an iced version of the beverage for those who think the weather is not quite autumnal just yet.Stand Up to Cancer Telecast 2018: When is it, how can I watch and which celebrities are involved?Shakira net worth revealed as she resumes world tourSerial podcast season 3: Everything you need to knowEngland vs Spain - UEFA Nations League match: Everything you need to knowMiss America 2019: When and where is it, preliminary winners and moreGame of Thrones prequel filming to start in February 2019South Korea debates whether bands like BTS should be exempt from military service Celebrity Big Brother final: All you need to know about the 2018 CBB finaleUS Open 2018 women\u0026#8217s semi-finals: All you need to knowIs Mike Pence the Trump administration senior official who authored the New York Times op-ed? Strictly Come Dancing 2018: What is the Strictly curse?Who is Chris Young?

However, when he turns 19, he will undergo a physical examination which will determine whether or not he is suitable to enter the military.After two years of conscription, they are placed on the reserve roster and will have to attend a few days of annual military training for six years. South Korea currently has one of the longest military service providers in the world.However, rules put in place in 1973 state that athletes who have won medals in the Olympic Games or gold medals in the Asian Games are granted exemptions from the military service and only required to do four weeks of basic military training, in addition to 42 months worth of sports.They are then put on the same roster as a civilian and they are able to continue with their career during their duty. The 2012 Summer Olympics bronze medal-winning football team, 2008 Olympics gold medalist badminton player Lee Yong-dae, swimmer Park Tae-hwan, 2014 Asian Games gold medalist Hyeon Chung and 2018 Asian Games gold medalist footballer Son Heung-min are all exempt.      However, in 2017, an opposition lawmaker said that the exemptions that are in place at present unfairly exclude the achievements of bands such as BTS, saying: ‘If you win a classical music competition such as in violin or piano, military exemption is granted.‘However, winning a pop music competition, such as the Billboard albums chart, gets you nothing.’ According to Korea Boo, in May 2018, an amendment was made to the South Korea Military Service Law that meant that any male who is 28 and older cannot delay their enlistment for any reason.In addition to this, men who are between 25 and 27 must receive permission to travel outside of the country and each male can only obtain five of these foreign travel permits, each permit allowing up to six months of overseas travel.These new laws will result in a lot of problems for the music business, especially for BTS if they decide to embark on another world tour, for example. Alongside this, groups like BTS, EXO and GOT7 will enter the military sooner than planned and having to put their careers on hiatus much earlier.The BTS members are already 25 or will turn 25 soon, which will mean that they will not be permitted to travel as freely as they have done so before and could mean that they may not be able to appear on television or at award ceremonies as often because they choose to use up their travel allowance for tours.Stand Up to Cancer Telecast 2018: When is it, how can I watch and which celebrities are involved?Shakira net worth revealed as she resumes world tourSerial podcast season 3: Everything you need to knowEngland vs Spain - UEFA Nations League match: Everything you need to knowMiss America 2019: When and where is it, preliminary winners and moreGame of Thrones prequel filming to start in February 2019South Korea debates whether bands like BTS should be exempt from military service Celebrity Big Brother final: All you need to know about the 2018 CBB finaleUS Open 2018 women\u0026#8217s semi-finals: All you need to knowIs Mike Pence the Trump administration senior official who authored the New York Times op-ed? Strictly Come Dancing 2018: What is the Strictly curse?Who is Chris Young?

Valery Starchenko, 66, is the uncle of one of the Novichok poisoning suspects Alexander Petrov          CCTV images of Petrov and Boshirov the day before the attack at the train station Theresa May claimed both Petrov and Boshirov are GRU agents and that their mission to plant novichok at the Skripal family home in Salisbury would have been approved at the highest levels in the Kremlin.There is also evidence that Petrov made a trip to London from 28 February to 5 March 2017, claimed Fontanka based in St Petersburg.With Boshirov, he also made previous trips together to Europe, according to flight records.\u0027From September 2016 to March 2018 they visited Amsterdam, Geneva, Milan and went several times to Paris.\u0027Boshirov and Petrov are known to have non biometric passports with almost identical numbers, suggesting they were issued two years ago at the same time.Petrov is believed to have been born in June or July 1979, making him 39.Boshirov is said to be born on 12 April 1978 making him 40.He appears to have a job - possibly his cover - as an employee of Microgen, national manufacturer of immune and biological medication.Microgen reports to the ministry of healthcare and was established in 2003.It is unclear if such a role would give him any expertise in the dangers of novichok, a nerve agent manufactured in Soviet times as a chemical weapon which was used in the Salisbury attack.Russia accuses Britain of \u0027dirty tricks\u0027 over CCTV Gatwick...Assassins\u0027 European tour: Russians named in spy poisoning...Face-off at the UN: Russian ambassador accuses UK of...Share this article    Yulia Chopivskaya, from Ukraine, aged around 30, was the only Facebook friend of Boshirov          Chopivskaya said she met the Russian for about half an hour at a cafe in Prague around five years agoThe secretive Boshirov had only one friend on a Facebook account, it appears, a glamorous Ukrainian woman.She has spoken of the \u0027nightmare\u0027 caused by the revelation from London that he is a suspected spy who poisoned the Skripals.Yulia Chopivskaya, from Ukraine, aged around 30, said she met the Russian for about half an hour at a cafe in Prague around five years ago.He then set up a Facebook account with her as his sole friend.She denies having seen him since but today has been inundated with demands to know if she is close to the spy.\u0027This is a nightmare,\u0027 she said.\u0027I haven\u0027t stayed in touch with this person and I don\u0027t know him.\u0027I deleted him from my friend\u0027s list.She said: \u0027I don\u0027t know if this is a real last name or not.\u0027In 2013 or 2014 I met a guy who introduced himself as Ruslan, it was in Prague.\u0027Then he asked how to find me on Facebook and added me there.\u0027We chatted for half an hour maximum and said goodbye to each other at that very cafe.\u0027Since then I haven\u0027t seen him.\u0027His Facebook only has a street scene from Prague.She did not recognise him from the picture released by police in London, she said.She claimed: \u0027I don\u0027t know the person in the photograph.\u0027Boshirov like Petrov has not spoken on the British allegations.Anonymous social media channel Nezygar also surmised that Britain had a high-ranking mole inside the GRU, the military intelligence identified by Theresa May as sending two agents to Salisbury to launch a chemical weapons attack.          Novichok poisoning suspects Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov are shown on CCTV on Fisherton Road, Salisbury at 1:05pm on 04 March 2018Citing an intelligence source, Nezygar claimed the most likely explanation of the poisoning in Salisbury was a mafia operation or a British provocation to undermine Russia.\u0027Theresa\u0027 May either publicly disclosed information about British intelligence having a high-rank mole within Russian military intelligence who passed confirming information or it is a simple assumption, manipulation, a game of coincidences,\u0027 stated the channel.The visibility of the Russian pair in Britain and the bungled attack \u0027clearly raises suspicions about their professionalism and qualification\u0027, suggesting they are not GRU.\u0027The look of the \u0027officers\u0027 is more like members of an organised crime community.\u0027Russia has accused Britain of tinkering with CCTV images of the two alleged spies.Pictures showed Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov separately walking up steps at Gatwick Airport.Yet both images are timed at the same moment - 16:22:43.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zhakarova said: \u0027Either the date and the exact time were overlaid on the image, or the staff of the Russian GRU learned to walk simultaneously - but their images are captured in two different photographs.\u0027The pictures released by the Metropolitan Police were being mocked on Russian social media.One said: \u0027Yes, the corridors (at Gatwick Airport) are different.\u0027These are corridors at border control.\u0027But what an amazing synchronization of the GRU\u0027s staff.\u0027\u0027Don\u0027t worry it happens - people will swallow such \u0027evidence\u0027,\u0027 said a social media comment mocking Britain over the pictures.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/06/14/4FC7F07200000578-6138031-image-a-2_1536241871759.jpg","title":"Thailands cave boys centerpiece mall exhibition","story":"    Cave expert Vernon Unsworth, 63, and his wife Woranan Ratrawiphukkun, 40, attended an event called United As One today in honour of the young boys he helped to rescue          The young Thai football team whose terrifying ordeal in a flooded cave captivated the world earlier this year recounted their memories of their rescue (pictured with some of the ing experts who saved them)          Cave expert Mr Unsworth (left) poses with a guest during the United As One event in Bangkok  Members of the Wild Boars soccer team pose for a group photograph with Thai Culture Minister Veera Rojpojanarat, center left, following a public discussion in Bangkok, ThailandMr Unsworth, whose advice and experience were considered crucial to the rescue operation, had previously criticized a well-publicized effort by Musk to lend a custom-built mini-submarine to the cave rescue effort. Mr Musk responded on Twitter with comments strongly implying that the Briton was a pedophile.The matter was revived last week, with Musk - when asked about the threat of a libel suit - doubling down on his accusations.\u0027I\u0027ll sue him in ALL three countries!\u0027: British caver...Share this articleHe suggested in emails to the news website BuzzFeed that Unsworth was a \u0027child rapist\u0027 and had moved to northern Thailand to take \u0027a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.\u0027He provided no evidence for his allegations.Experienced er Mr Unsworth from St Albans in Hertfordshire described Mr Musk’s allegations that he had a child bride and had moved to an area notorious for child sex trafficking as ‘100 per cent’ untrue.   Mr Musk (right) had accused Mr Unsworth (left) of being ‘a paedo’ during the rescue of 12 schoolboys from the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex. The matter was revived last week when Mr Musk suggested in emails to BuzzFeed that Mr Unsworth was a \u0027child rapist\u0027          Some members of the team went through a reproduction of the cave with simulated sounds of water dripping while equipment used by rescuers and other memorabilia are on display          Thailand\u0027s military government, eager to share the glory of the good-news story, has trotted the boys out for public appearances and interviews since their dramatic rescue.

This image released by the Royal Thai Navy shows some of the boys wrapped in protective foil blankets‘I’ve been told to be very careful because this guy may do anything to make my life difficult,’ he said.Mr Unsworth’s girlfriend, Woranan Ratrawiphukkun, 40, yesterday said she was ‘no child bride’. She met him seven years ago, when she would have been at least 32.          All members of the team were found alive within the cave complex at Tham Luang cave in Khun Nam Nang Non Forest ParShe runs a nail salon and lives with Mr Unsworth in the countryside at Chiang Rai – near the scene of the cave rescue.Musk, whose seemingly erratic behavior on other matters have drawn concern from investors, also in coarse terms told BuzzFeed that he hoped Unsworth sues him.In Bangkok, deputy government spokesman Weerachon Sukhondhapatipak, who has been organizing many of the events with the boys, responded with concern to Musk\u0027s comments highlighting Thailand as a destination for sex tourists.\u0027When there is this kind of perception we shouldn\u0027t overlook it. This reflects our image, which we have to fix. \u0027We won\u0027t blame him and say Oh, he said all those bad things,\u0027 he said. \u0027We should take this information and use it to make changes.\u0027  They spoke at an exhibition about their ordeal of being trapped.

They are carefully guided by a Thai government committee set up to control who has access to the boys as they draw attention from filmmakers and the media.At least five of them at Thursday\u0027s forum said in more or less the same words that \u0027my life is the same, but more people are approaching me.\u0027The boys have already detailed much of their adventure in a news conference after they were released from hospital observation following their rescue, and in interviews with the U.S. television network ABC.

Adul Sam-on admitted that the area they were staying in the cave stank of urine - the matter of body excretions had been a subject of much speculation on social media.The boys appeared unaware of the government\u0027s advice to avoid talking about their ordeal.Adul said he was surprised when he met officials such as American diplomats, but was not asked about what happened in the cave.

Customers were promised refunds but some are still awaiting payment.The closure was the result of a dispute between Sports Direct, which bought House of Fraser out of administration last month, and the warehouse operator, XPO, which is understood to have been owed about £13m when the department store collapsed.Suppliers said stock began flowing into stores on Wednesday night after an agreement was reached between XPO and Sports Direct. Under the deal, XPO’s Milton Keynes warehouse will deliver goods for House of Fraser until November when it will close with the loss of about 300 jobs.Another warehouse in Wellingborough will remain open until at least March, but a further 300 jobs remain at risk there as industry insiders suggested it was likely that Sports Direct would distribute House of Fraser’s goods from its own warehouse in Shirebrook in future.Alan Costello, an organiser for the GMB union, which represents workers at the Milton Keynes site, said: “GMB is disappointed by the fact that XPO and Sports Direct are clearly only interested in the stock in the warehouse. They couldn’t care less about our members or their livelihoods.“This whole standoff, during which our members have been left in limbo, has been about commodities, not people.”One of House of Fraser’s major suppliers, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, this week withdrew its brands, which include Jacques Vert and Jane Norman.Mike Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct, is expected to visit one of House of Fraser’s stores in Glasgow on Friday with the chain’s chief executive, Alex Williamson, as he attempts to secure new deals with landlords across the country.Sports Direct and XPO did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e47cf325f63413a71fa610985f3506bbfd0b49a/0_8_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a145a23165b477c79ab9dc7730044116","title":"india lgbt homophobia section 377","story":"“History owes an apology to the members of this community and their families … for the ignominy and ostracism that they have suffered through the centuries. The members of this community were compelled to live a life full of fear of reprisal and persecution.” With these words, Justice Indu Malhotra, one of the judges of the Indian supreme court, held that section 377 of the penal code, which criminalises consensual sexual acts between adults of the same sex, was unconstitutional.As one of the lawyers involved in a previous constitutional challenge to section 377 before the Delhi high court and the Indian supreme court, I know how important today’s judgment is. By ruling against the colonial-era law, the court delivered a powerful riposte to institutionalised disgust and contempt aimed at the LGBT community in India.Disgust and contempt have been central themes of section 377 since its inception. In 1830 Thomas Macaulay, the main drafter of the penal code, called homosexual sex “odious” and “revolting”. In 1884, a court in north India ruling on the prosecution of a hijra (a member of South Asia’s traditional transgender community), commented that a physical examination of the accused revealed she “had the marks of a habitual catamite” and commended the police’s desire to “check these disgusting practices”. In 1934, a judge in Sindh (now Pakistan) described a man who had consensual sex with another man as “a despicable specimen of humanity”. In 2003, the government of India said that decriminalising homosexuality would “open the floodgates of delinquent behaviour”. And in\u0026nbsp2013 a supreme court ruling on an earlier challenge to\u0026nbspsection 377 (overruled by today’s judgment) held that LGBT people constituted a “minuscule minority” who bore only “so-called rights”.This contempt had and continues to have real consequences. In the 1990s, the HIVAids epidemic arrived in India, linking homosexuality in the public mind with disease and contagion. In 1992, the Delhi police arrested 18 men in a park as part of a “clean-up” drive. The allegation was not that they were having sex but “were about to indulge in homosexual acts”.Out of context, the words used in today’s judgment, like privacy, dignity and equality, can seem anodyne. In fact, they lie at the core of what it means for our communities to survive. Earlier this year, a lesbian couple jumped to their death. In notes left behind, they are reported to have written: “We have left this world to live with each other. The world did not allow us to stay together.” Today’s judgment makes it possible that people may no longer see fear in the future, but hope.• Mayur Suresh is a lecturer in law at Soas, University of London.

Cutting public spending, voters were told, might make the UK a bit meaner. But if there was a social price to pay for this less generous approach to public spending, it would be easily\u0026nbspoutweighed by the benefits of making the UK into a leaner and more prosperous place.With the upcoming conference season sure to be dominated by Brexit, the question is when, if and how\u0026nbspthe reckoning that is urgently required with regard\u0026nbspto these decisions is going to take place. Universal\u0026nbspcredit, the flagship welfare reform of the coalition and brainchild of former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, is a disaster. This week the\u0026nbspResolution Foundation\u0026nbspthinktank issued a stark warning that unless\u0026nbspthe timetable for migrating claimants to the new system is relaxed, the whole thing\u0026nbspcould collapse. Following a highly critical National\u0026nbspAudit Office report highlighting official intransigence as well as flaws in delivery and design, the question must now be asked whether this hugely expensive project should be abandoned altogether.Meanwhile, mounting chaos in the justice system is finally attracting public attention. Last month the government stripped the private contractor G4S of responsibility for Birmingham prison, admitting that officers there had effectively lost control. This followed an announcement that the partial privatisation of probation services has failed and will be reversed. This week MPs debated a review of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act amid rising concerns over the impact of legal aid cuts, including the phenomenon of “advice deserts” in parts of the country where services have virtually ceased to exist. A growing sense of crisis in the courts themselves is ably documented in the new eponymous book by the Secret Barrister.Now council leaders are warning that children’s services face a tipping point, with 90 children entering care every day but repeated appeals for additional funding from the Treasury rejected. Only a safeguarding catastrophe will propel these most vulnerable members of society to news headlines. Mostly these distressed, frightened and neglected young people are hidden from sight.Universal credit is due to be rolled out to more than a million tax credit claimants. Its failure carries a significant political risk. But mostly the political calculation appears to have been that people will not notice as spending on jails, support services for vulnerable families and legal aid is whittled away. Or that if they do notice, perhaps they won’t much care. Often, those whose tribulations go unnoticed are the same people: so the children who grow up in foster care because their parents couldn’t manage face a statistically far higher chance of ending up in the criminal justice system, or suffering poor health leading to reliance on benefits.Current and former ministers as well as the MPs who voted through legislation must be held accountable for a litany of failures that amounts to an abandonment of their responsibilities to some of the most vulnerable people in the UK. Some ameliorative measures have already been taken, for example in adjustments to the legal aid rules. Politicians can be mistaken. Now is the time for them to change course."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b90a364f0c1b7f91080fee966281c8cc52cfd54b/0_139_2736_1642/master/2736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae37bdca09cba290f76e6d96f7437658","title":"life victoria wood celebrated bury exhibiton","story":"Show in comedian’s home town includes original scripts, song sheets, photos and costumesAn exhibition celebrating the life of Victoria Wood opens in her native Bury on Saturday.The show at Bury Art Museum includes original scripts, song sheets, photos and costumes, including the yellow beret she wore playing one of her most-loved characters, the lost girl looking for her friend Kimberley. (“She’s really, really tall and really, really wide. If she had a suitcase on her head she’d look like a fitted wardrobe.”)There are three versions of the lyrics to The Ballad of Barry and Freda, her tribute to middle-aged love-making (“Stop pouting  Stop shouting  You know I pulled a muscle when I did that grouting”). Edits reveal she originally intended the song to be called Let’s Do It but changed her mind before going on stage.Also on display for the first time is backstage footage of the filming of Victoria Wood’s All Day Breakfast, her Christmas Day BBC special in 1992, and a recording of a rehearsal of Dinnerladies before a live audience.There is also a script she sent to the BBC while a student at Birmingham University, rejected by the broadcaster and returned to sender, as well as an even earlier Wood original: a story she wrote for Bury grammar school’s magazine in the 1960s, called Pardon?The items were selected from Wood’s literary estate, a treasure trove in London maintained by her old agents after her death aged 62 in April 2016.Susan Lord, the curator of the exhibition, said the show was “a behind-the-scenes look at Victoria Wood’s creativity. It gives an insight into her thought process. She was a very lateral thinker who loved to take ideas and play with words.”Wood’s brother, Chris Foote Wood, who has written a biography of his sister and will give a speech at the opening of the exhibition on Saturday, said he was looking forward to better understanding how she worked. “She would write, rewrite, write again and rework her scripts,” he said. “Actors would complain that they turned up for rehearsals and learned all their lines, only to come in on the Saturday to find Vic had been up all night rewriting them all. She was adamant that the audience should be given the best.“When she was making Dinnerladies she would write more episodes than would ever be broadcast so that the weakest one could be thrown away.”Foote Wood has raised money to have a statue made of his sister, which will be erected in Bury next year. He said she would have mixed feelings about being celebrated in her home town.“Victoria had a double view of fame. She always wanted to be famous, ever since she was a little girl. But she just wanted fame to enable her to do new things. For example, if she won an award she would say she was pleased to receive it but saw it just as confirmation that she was doing a good job. Then she would come home and put the award in a cupboard. They weren’t on display on the mantlepiece but for her a means to an end.”Her Baftas and her OBE have been dug out of the cupboard for the Bury exhibition, which opens on Saturday and will run for a year, admission free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e479d16982f6fd675158cfce5b0fe7ff68aa307f/0_356_5400_3242/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a956ff606443f1add8ed6b83fed5341c","title":"global soft drink firms back plan to eliminate packaging waste","story":"Industry makes biggest commitment yet to ending its use of throwaway plastic bottles Global soft drink companies have made their biggest commitment yet to eliminating the use of throwaway plastic bottles, in an action plan presented to parliament.In a report sponsored by the likes of Danone, Suntory and Nestlé, the companies give unequivocal backing to a government-implemented deposit and return scheme. Their ambition is for zero plastic packaging to be sent to landfill or escape into the natural environment by 2030, and for packaging to be made entirely from recycled or renewable materials or both.Thursday’s report, produced by the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, said: “Achieving this vision requires all stakeholders in the bottled water and soft drinks value chain to commit to eliminating plastic packaging waste as a strategic priority.”It comes as the government considers imposing a tax on single-use plastics that could see plastic straws banned by next year.“Leading bottled water and soft drinks companies understand that coordinated action is required across the value chain to address the challenge of plastic packaging waste from bottled water and soft drinks and to help create long-term sustainable solutions,” the report said.It calls on government to reform the producer responsibility scheme – a formula through which companies are supposed to contribute towards recycling their products, but which has been heavily criticised.And the firms want all revenue from a new scheme and a deposit return system to be reinvested in recycling and reprocessing of plastic packaging. They say a significant shift in consumer behaviour is also required.Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner for Greenpeace, welcomed the move. “Some of the world’s largest food companies now recognise the huge environmental impacts single-use plastic bottles are having on our marine environment,” she said.“And it’s positive to see major businesses backing a fully comprehensive deposit return schemes for drinks containers and acknowledging that they should also cut the amount of throwaway plastic they churn out. What we need to see now is real investment in the solutions and ambitious targets for plastic packaging reduction and reuse. With nearly 500bn plastic bottles being produced globally every year and just a few of them being recycled, action cannot come a moment too soon.”Annual consumption of plastic bottles is set to top half a trillion by 2021.

The animals are known to live in suburban areas in the region, but these are isolated and at risk. “If we get lots of winter flooding, during hibernation, you potentially wipe out a large area of hedgehog population, and if there is not a local population that can repopulate the area, you get an area that is desolate,” Williams said.Badger numbers have roughly doubled since 1992, when they gained increased legal protection, although the population is probably still lower than in the historical past. But the new data suggests that badger numbers would have to rise sixfold from current levels to wipe out hedgehogs completely. “Badgers and hedgehogs can, and do, coexist, as was the case historically for thousands of years,” said Williams.Hugh Warwick, at the British Hedgehog Preservation Society, said the research showed the value of back gardens as a refuge: “This fascinating piece of research reminds us of how vital a habitat our back gardens can be and one we can easily improve with a few small actions. The most important is to ensure that hedgehogs can get into your garden, and a small hole – 13cm – will do.”While the intensification of agriculture since the 1950s has seen much habitat destroyed, more than 30,000km of hedgerows have been planted or restored in the last 20 years, according to the National Farmers’ Union. Pesticide use, which can kill the invertebrates that hedgehogs and badgers feed on, has been declining since 1990, the NFU says.Williams welcomed these changes, but said it could take 20 years or more before they led to an increase in mature, valuable habitat: “It is likely we are not seeing some of the benefit of these changes immediately.”He added: “However, I think there is a wider societal issue. Farmers get quite a raw deal and are blamed for lots of the habitat loss, whereas as a society we have decided we want lots of fairly cheap food and and we are not prepared to pay a premium for food that is farmed in a more environmentally way. As a society, we have to choose if we are prepared to pay that premium so we can have food alongside the benefit of a good environment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bda4675ee35a0a6b6ebdfdcb5acf982d07d4a69d/80_1_2708_1625/master/2708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a813acb10f436922aacad0f10e7e9248","title":"if anyone can maga it is nasa how first man put a rocket up the politics of space","story":"The moon-landing movie has sparked a furore for failing to show the planting of a US flag. But Hollywood has a long, complicated relationship with the final frontierA giant leap for mankind or purely an American achievement? Nobody much cared at the time, but half a century later the moon landings have unexpectedly become a political litmus test. Blame the Neil Armstrong biopic First Man, directed by Damien Chazelle and starring Ryan Gosling – in particular, the moment when (spoiler alert), after a lifetime’s training and tragedy, Armstrong finally sets foot on the moon. We see him descending the lunar lander, we see the astronaut roaming the lunar surface, we see him turn to look back at Earth, but what we don’t see is the precise moment when Armstrong planted the US flag. Many have decided, even without having seen the movie, that this is one small step too far.“This is total lunacy,” tweeted the Republican senator Marco Rubio. “The American people paid for that mission, on rockets built by Americans, with American technology \u0026amp carrying American astronauts. It wasn’t a UN mission.”The actor James Woods weighed in: “Omitting the seminal moment in the midst of mankind’s greatest achievement seems a purposeful denigration of the 400,000 Americans who accomplished it.” The conservative columnist Bill Kristol called it a “foolish and pernicious falsification of history”. Even Buzz Aldrin, Armstrong’s Apollo 11 crewmate, tweeted two pictures of himself standing on the moon next to the stars and stripes, annotated with hashtags including #proudtobeanAmerican, #freedom, #honor and #onenation.Inevitably, the news was relayed to Donald Trump, whose response raised the affair to full-on culture-war level. “It’s almost like they’re embarrassed at the achievement coming from America I think it’s a terrible thing,” Trump told the Daily Caller, a conservative news site. “When you think of Neil Armstrong and when you think of the landing on the moon, you think about the American flag. For that reason, I wouldn’t even want to watch the movie.” Wait till he finds out Ryan Gosling is Canadian.Chazelle’s omission of the flag-planting was deliberate, but not politically motivated, the director said in response. “My goal with this movie was to share with audiences the unseen, unknown aspects of America’s mission to the moon – particularly Neil Armstrong’s personal saga and what he may have been thinking and feeling during those famous few hours … This film is about one of the most extraordinary accomplishments not only in American history, but in human history.”Chazelle was supported by Armstrong’s sons and James R Hansen, author of the nonfiction book First Man, from which the movie was adapted. In a joint statement, they said: “We do not feel this movie is anti-American in the slightest. Quite the opposite.”In the same week that Nike’s sponsorship of NFL knee-taker-in-chief Colin Kaepernick compelled some Americans to set fire to their trainers, Chazelle’s movie is another illustration of how polarised US life has become, especially when it comes to the flag. Depending on which end of the political scale you are, First Man is either being wilfully interpreted as political when its stated agenda is the opposite, or it is another case of liberal Hollywood trolling conservatives, rewriting history and generally making America less great.If Chazelle had intended to go full liberal, he would surely have called the movie First Person, but the director may have had other reasons for ditching the flag-planting scene. With awards season approaching, First Man was always going to be an Oscar shot, especially given Chazelle’s near miss in 2017, when the best picture award was mistakenly handed to La La Land, rather than Moonlight.In the current climate, overtly patriotic movies do not tend to go down well with the Academy, whereas tacitly anti-Trump films do – such as Steven Spielberg’s The Post last year. Its account of the Pentagon Papers affair invited comparisons between Richard Nixon’s White House and Trump’s assault on press freedom and earned it a clutch of nominations. Even last year’s best picture winner, The Shape of Water, conspicuously cast white government males as the villains and brought the marginalised figures of US society to the centre: women, gay people, disabled people, people of colour, immigrants (albeit of the aquatic fish-man variety) – groups Trump has vilified, in other words.A similar ersification has been going on with space movies. Historically, space has been overwhelmingly white, male and American, in real life and in film, as seen in “serious” space films like The Right Stuff, Apollo 13 and Clint Eastwood’s Space Cowboys. Incidentally, Eastwood was first in line to make First Man. He acquired the rights to the book in 2003, before its publication. Hansen even engineered a meeting between Eastwood and a reluctant Armstrong. According to Hansen, they did not hit it off: “Neil didn’t like the violence in Clint’s movies and Clint apparently appreciated space cowboys more than he did real engineer-astronauts.” As something of a corrective, Hidden Figures (2017) portrayed the real-life African American women whose mathematical calculations helped put Nasa in space in the early 60s, even as they contended with discrimination in pre-civil-rights Virginia.Mindful of its global audience, Hollywood has been steadily de-Americanising space. For example, Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity, the big Oscar-winner in 2013, focused on white American astronauts Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, but also incorporated the International Space Station and China’s Tiangong-1 space station (and was made primarily by Mexican and British film-makers). Ridley Scott’s The Martian, set in 2035, also envisaged a spacescape in which the Chinese came to the aid of Nasa, loaning them a rocket to rescue stranded Matt Damon. Nothing says “the future” in a sci-fi movie like a erse, multicultural crew.When it comes to real-world politics, the US has always sent out a mixed message. Fifty-six years ago, in his famous Rice University speech that sought to persuade Americans to go to the moon, John F Kennedy told the US: “The eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace.”That flag was always envisaged as being the stars and stripes – and it has always been a bit of both: part “flag of conquest”, part “banner of freedom and peace”. As well as professing lofty sentiments about conquering space for all mankind, in the same speech Kennedy characterised the Apollo missions as “part of a great national effort of the United States of America”. That effort was to beat the Soviet Union at all costs. After all, it had already produced the “first man” of space exploration: Yuri Gagarin.Politically, the US’s space programme has been one of the few areas of continual bipartisan agreement and cooperation, although the militarisation of space has never been far from its leaders’ minds. Jimmy Carter’s 1978 space policy was full of sentiment about maintaining the freedom of space “for the security and welfare of mankind”, but it also decreed the US would “pursue activities in space in support of its right of self-defence”. Ronald Reagan’s ill-fated Strategic Defense Initiative – “Star Wars” – was proof to many that he had been watching too many movies. Now we have its 21st-century equivalent in Trump’s much-derided “Space Force” proposal.Viewed through the Trump prism, the 1969 moon landings are surely the ultimate “make America great again” touchstone: a moment of incontestable US supremacy that occurred within many of his voters’ lifetimes. The fact that the moon landings still represent the pinnacle of human, and American, accomplishment in space nearly 50 years later fits into the Trumpian narrative. He recognises that if anyone can Maga, it is Nasa.While the Trump administration has burned bridges or slashed funds at most government departments, it has increased Nasa’s funding (although its budget is still a fraction of what it was in the Apollo days). As part of his Space Policy Directive unveiled last December, Trump has pledged to return astronauts to the moon: “This time, we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprints – we will establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars, and perhaps someday to many worlds beyond.” Space exploration is one of the few areas where Democrats and Republicans are broadly in agreement.When it comes down to it, perhaps this litmus test is about whether we see the US flag more as Kennedy’s “banner of freedom and peace” or a “flag of conquest”, hostile or otherwise. Chazelle has clearly chosen the former. First Man consciously makes its key visual symbol the view of the Earth from the moon, not the planting of the flag. On a more practical level, Armstrong did not plant the flag by himself Aldrin helped him. In the photos of the moon landings we have all seen a million times, it is Aldrin who is standing next to the flag, not Armstrong. “We’re not doing the Buzz Aldrin story, or the Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong story,” Chazelle explained to Variety. “We’re doing Neil Armstrong subjective, emotional, thinking about his past on the moon in a sort of surreal, emotional way. That was our priority.”What would Armstrong have said about all this? Probably nothing. His brand of heroism is invariably appended with the word “reluctant”. Armstrong was unimpeachably a patriot who loved and served his country, but he was also tight-lipped. He barely made any public statements about his experiences on the moon – or anything else. He did, however, make one concise, very famous proclamation about it being a giant leap for mankind. Perhaps, in that transcendent moment, he wanted us to be more than a planet of warring tribes, nation states or political factions. And we are, right?First Man is released in the UK on 12 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e15c8c329b8faabbe59a315debb66465dc522065/0_1903_4039_2423/master/4039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b56f640139172c7837a247a62c82f57a","title":"joe wicks recipe chicken orzo bake post workout","story":"This healthy post-workout recipe will keep you feeling full for longer – and it tastes great, tooMy rat-a-tat bake is perfect for a family meal or sharing with friends, and I think it’s great for autumn.

In short, this is the kind of game even Wales manager Ryan Giggs might turn up for, rather than pull out with one of those mysterious niggles that invariably used to be diagnosed by his personal physician Dr Ferg around international break-time when he was a player.Having failed to make the Ethics World Cup following their excellent showing at the previous Euros, Wales will be eager to exact revenge on an O’Ireland side that ruined their chances and who went on to be hockeyed by Christian Eriksen, since replaced in the Denmark team by a part-time barman, in a two-legged qualifier for Russia. Wales have played three friendlies on foreign soil under Giggs, but his reign really begins in earnest before an expectant home crowd in Cardiff.

The mind goes back to the 2014-15 season, when Chelsea won the Premier League title during Mourinho’s second spell there. I had just written a column for the BBC praising José for bringing a spark back to the club and, as our paths crossed at the training ground at Cobham, he gave me a big hug and thanked me for the kind words. There was a smile on the manager’s face and a twinkle in his eye.Fast forward to the following season and around the time the Eva Carneiro affair was taking hold. Once again José and I crossed paths at Cobham he was leaving the media room as I was entering it to do some media for Chelsea TV. “Hi boss,” I said as we met. Mourinho practically blanked me. No words this time, no pleasantries, and the type of look that screamed: “What are you doing here?”In my view, when things are going well for José and people are saying nice things about him he becomes the most likable guy in the room. But when the pressure is on and things are starting to go badly a completely different person comes across – an edge takes over and, as we are seeing currently, he resorts to reminding everyone of his past success in a bid to deflect from current failures. Or perhaps, to put it more accurately, to remind everyone how great he once was.Mourinho in this moment seems insecure and during his time as a manager that insecurity has led to some real Jekyll and Hyde behaviour. Now it’s the turn of those at Manchester United to experience it. It can be entertaining but also damaging, for Mourinho as much as anybody because by constantly banging on about what he achieved in the past he is bringing into sharp focus the fact he is not doing it now. Imagine if every time Manchester City lost a game Pep Guardiola went on about what he won at Barcelona? It would get very tedious very quickly, and that is what is happening with Mourinho at United.Saying that, I think the club should stick with him and Mourinho can show, for perhaps the first time in his career, he is the type of manager who can withstand a stormy period. The next few weeks are going to be interesting, especially if the pressure around the manager does not subside. That can happen in two ways – if the team keep winning and he calms down. For United’s sake, both of those things need to take place as quickly as possible.Thinking back to how it fell apart for Mourinho at Chelsea, I do have some sympathy for him. At most clubs it is the manager who determines the long-term stability of the players but at Chelsea it seems very much the other way round.On the whole the players are good guys - humble, keen to succeed – but they are also sensitive to managerial styles and when one gets stale, or simply no longer suits, there develops a real agitation for change.Take, for example, the way Eden Hazard told Mourinho he was injured and had to come off in the defeat at Leicester in December 2015 that led to the manager being sacked, or the way the same player made clear last season he was not happy with Antonio Conte deploying him as a striker against Manchester City. The big players historically hold a lot of influence at Chelsea and while I would never doubt their attempts to win matches for the club, their levels undoubtedly change depending on how they feel about a manager at the time. They’re either having him or they’re not, and once they’re not it spells borrowed time for the guy in charge.That’s why I’m reluctant to form firm conclusions on how successful Maurizio Sarri will be at Chelsea. He’s had a great start, with four wins in four games, and there are clear signs of him imposing his fantastic, forward-brand of football at the club, but in part it’s working because the likes of Hazard and David Luiz are buying into what he is trying to do. They had problems with Conte and have now decided, with a new man and a new way of playing, to go again. How long that will last is hard to say.Being a former Chelsea player I wish them all the best for the season. On a broader level I hope someone provides Manchester City with a fight for the title. Frankly, it was embarrassing to see how much better they were compared with the other teams in the ision last year.Liverpool were the only club to ruffle City’s feathers last season, and have started this one well, so I can definitely see them challenging for the title. Their front three were phenomenal for last parts of last season and it will be interesting to see whether Mohamed Salah can go again and reproduce 30-plus goals.I’d also like to see Tottenham be serious contenders but I have my doubts they can be. Spurs have an amazing team, a world-class striker in Harry Kane and an amazing manager, but they appear to be a club associated with winning games but never winning any trophies.Regardless, I’ll be watching on with interest from Turin, where I’m continuing to adjust to a new life in a new city. The experience has so far been great. Turin is as Italian as it can get but the language continues to be a challenge. Picking up words is one thing but constructing sentences is a whole other difficulty. But I’m determined to improve and fully embrace this new chapter in my life.It’s great being part of Juventus. As expected, there’s a real family feel to the club, alongside a big desire to win as often as possible. I feel very much at home, having developed a good camaraderie with my teammates already. Training is also fascinating – I’m learning things on a technical level that I have never learned before. Aged 31, I feel like a kid again.Unfortunately, I am yet to bump into Cristiano Ronaldo. Saying that, I have seen Cristiano Jr, his son, who plays for the youth team. They train at Vinovo, where we train, so … you never know.• Eni Aluko’s column will appear weekly"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0b9658e296fa98b01d58f6d6d89d5222c591806/14_78_3126_1876/master/3126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b5ae9c000920284502e7660d816fe0d","title":"wales v republic of ireland germany v france and more nations league live","story":"43 min: Declan Rice, if you’re reading this, please feel free to drop us a line to share your thoughts on the game...40 min: For those asking, Wales’ record victory over the Republic of Ireland before today was ... 3-1. They do have an 11-0 victory on their record but that was against a pre-independence Ireland in the 19th century. I believe Jon Walters came on as a second-half substitute.Ampadu nudges Walters off the ball in midfield, glides forward 20 yards and then offloads to Ramsey, who shots low into the net from the edge of the box. So simple and so deadly from the Welsh against an increasingly ramshackle Irish side! 36 min: Ireland do get their act together, for a moment at least! Coleman swaps snappy passes with Hendrick down the right and then cuts the ball back from the byline for Robinson, who lifts his shot a yard over the bar from 10 yards. 34 min: Davies curls in a sweet cross from the let. Roberts darts between the Irish centreback and heads over the bar from eight yards! The fact that both Wales’ fullbacks were at the end of that Welsh move is representative of how the hosts have approached this game. They’re comfortably the better team here and could rack up a humiliating score if Ireland don’t get their act together. “Over in Germany the spirit of eleven-man defence is alive and well and being given a good outing by the French team,” observes Charles Antaki. “Did they really win the Word Cup this way? On the other hand, accentuating the positives, they are making Germany look almost dynamic.” Sounds like Paul Pogba will have to wait till he gets back to Old Trafford to play exciting football on the front foot. Right?30 min: Wales rip forward on the counter-attack, Brooks leading the charge. HE then feeds Lawrence on the left. He cut in-field à la Bale and rifles off a shot from 20 yards. Randolph gets down low to push it away. There’s a pleasing verve to this Welsh side.28 min: Cyrus Christie’s inclusion at right midfield was presumably intended to help Coleman to subdue Bale. But it is not working because (a) Bale is too good and (b) Bale moves all over, appearing on the left as often as the right. Given how predictable all that was, O’Neill really should have started with a proper attacking wide man such as Horgan or Burke. 26 min: Bale collects the ball in the same position as he was in when scoring his goal. This time Ward does not allow him to cut on to his left foot - at least not until reinforcements arrive. Bale is crowded out. Wales fans seem to be singing a chant intended to taunt “jammy bastards”. Harsh, really, as their team deserve this lead.GOAL! Norway 1-0 Cyprus (Johansen 21) Time for Cyprus to switch to Plan B if they’re going to avoid another defeat by Norway.21 min: While I - and hopefully Messers O’Neill and Keane - try to figure out how in heck Ireland are going to stop this bleeding horror show, here’s a report explaining why Wales will have it tougher on Sunday.It’s a Bale special! He trapped a long crossfield ball on his chest wide on the right, then sashayed in-field and curled a sumptuous shot into the top corner from 20 yards! 17 min: Ampadu has been very impressive so far. He’s running the show in midfield, mixing expansive passes with neat short balls. He’s looking like an old hand in central midfield, helped by the fact that Ireland are failing to put him under any pressure. Cyprus are holding Norway to 0-0 so far, a result they would be content with given they have never avoided defeated against the Norwegians. “I believe some of today’s fixtures are meaningless friendlies and others are semi-meaning-imbued Nations League fixtures,” reckons Peter Oh. “It must be hard to deal with such a confusing mix of meaninglessness and meaning.” Isn’t that what MBMs were invented for?13 min: The early exchanges in Germany have been surprisingly low quality. Germany are the more muscular side and France quite coy but both have been imprecise.10 min: Brooks brings a cheer from the crowd with a foxy piece of skill to elude Ward. He lost possession straight after but the first bit was a sign of the audacity with which Wales aim to play.9 min: Lawrence takes advantage of hesitation by Coleman to nick the ball off the Irish captain and lope forward again. But he loses control of it and allows Ireland to recover. So far, however, this has been a very vibrant performance by Giggs’ teams, whereas Ireland are looking shabby. Ampadu ks a ball from the centre cirlce wide to the right. Wales build from there and Allen then slips a cute ball through for Lawrence to run on to and fire past Randolph! That’s a nice move and finish but Clark needs to reflect on how Lawrence was able to dart past him unnoticed before latching on to Allen’s pass.3 min: Brooks makes a strong early impression with an enterprising run down the right and a good deep cross for Bale, coming in on the far side of the box. Bale collects the balls and then faffs about a bit before flicking the ball off to no one. 2 min: Ampadu’s first involvement sees him give away a freekick for a foul in Irish territory. His second, however, is a nice pass to Ramsey to get Wales moving forward with purpose. Ireland fold back into a back four. Christie seems to be operating at right-midfield.1 min: We have kickoff in Cardiff and across Europe.The band strikes up the first notes of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau and then stops to let the home supporters to take over ... and they do so with gusto. As Han Solo might have put it: that’s no crowd, that’s a choir! O’Neill: “We’ve got some players who haven’t been playing regularly but we’re trying to go as strong as we possibly can given the circumstances.”Bad news for ambitious Danish futsal players: word is that Denmark will be able to field their strongest team against Wales on Sunday after players agreed to suspend their boycott while negotiating a resolution in their image rights beef with the country’s FA.Here are the lineup for those friendlies:As for Irish permutations, it’s really not obvious how O’Neill’s men are going to line up. It could be a 3-5-2 with Coleman or Christie in a daring Kyle Walker-style right centre back role. Or maybe Stephen Ward in an even more daring left-centre back role. Or, going on previous form, it could be a 10-0-0 from O’Neill. One thing’s for sure, Giggs is going to be guessing just like the rest of us until we see what’s what. “Where will Giggs play Joe Allen?” demands-to-know Joshua Reynolds. “Will he be further forward as he is at Stoke or in a more defensive role?” I’m guessing he’ll be slightly more withdrawn than for Stoke but with instructions to get his box-to-box costume on. “Second, it says something that I find myself hoping ex Stoke player Jon Walters is part of the winning team rather than either of the current Stoke players who take the field for the Welsh.” Does it say you’re Irish? Or a fan of the Stoke team of yesteryear rather than the current version? If the latter, what do you make of James McClean? Here are the starting lineups. As you can see, the world champions do not appear to be resting on their laurels. The prospect of sticking one on their dear neighbours is obviously an enticing one. You get the feeling Joachim Löw’s position can’t withstand many more embarrassments. He’s decided against starting Leroy Sane, however. Giggs has opted to throw David Brooks and Ethan Ampadu straight into the fray. And why not? Both are highly talented and Brooks has made an excellent start to life in the Premier League following his move from Sheffield United to Bournemouth. There’s also some lad called Gareth Bale in Wales’ starting lineup, a notable change to the last time these countries met. Meanwhile, Connor Roberts starts at right-back.  For Ireland, Callum Robinson makes a first competitive start. He’s an ex-England youth international so no doubt the Irish fans lambasting Declan Rice will have words with the Preston forward. All things considered, Wales should win this. Martin O’Neil would be very happy to take smash-’n’-grab, you suspect.We already have a couple of results in, so if anyone ever asks you who won the first ever Nations League match, you can correctly answer Georgia, thanks to a 2-0 victory in Kazakkstan. And wow your friends by adding that the first scorer of a goal in the competition was Giorgi Chakvetadze, five minutes before Sergei Maliy became the competition’s first scorer of an own goal. So that’s Kazakhstan 0-2 Georgia. Elsewhere, Henrikh Mkhitaryan ensured he is unlukely to ever be entrusted with penalty-taking duties at Arsenal as he had a spotkick saved by Liechtenstein’s keeper. But Armenia still overcame their pesky opponents to win 2-1. Marcos Pizzelli and Tigran Barseghyan got the goals for the home team, while Sandro Wolfinger netted for Liechtenstein who’ll take encouragement from that given that their record in their last World Cup qualifying campaign was: Played 10, Won 0, Drew 0, Lost 10, Goals For 1 Goals Against 39. (But they did beat Qatar in a recent friendly so if they make it to the next World Cup, watch out, host nation!)  Hello and welcome to a new-fangled take on international football, as Uefa’s Nations League kicks off. It’s a complicated format, no doubt, but not so convoluted as to be incomprehensible. The gist of it is that the better a country does in this new competition, the better their chances of (a) reaching Euro 2020 – perhaps directly but most likely through favourable seeding for the traditional qualifying phase (which will begin in March 2019) and (b) gaining promotion to a higher level of the Nations League and thereby playing more prestigious competitive matches in the future. Four teams who do well in the Nations League will qualify directly for Euro 2020, including, possibly, a team from the lowest ranked tier (your Gibraltars, your Azerbaijans, your Kosovos and so on). As for today’s fixtures, there’s something for nearly everyone: we’ll be paying particular attention to Wales v Ireland but will be sure to keep you up to speed on goings-on elsewhere, especially Germany v France and, er, Latvia v Andorra and Gibraltar v Macedonia. There are also some enticing friendlies, including Holland v Peru and Portugal v Croatia. Now then, what of Wales v Ireland? It’s the Welsh team’s first competitive match under aspiring young manager Ryan Giggs and also their first since they wereWales have never beaten Ireland in a competitive match and Martin O’Neill’s side have not lost a competitive away match in six outings so this would be a fine scalp for Giggs were his team to claim it. It’s all happening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02586969a5bdbcffcaf485f2bee7946401f70c99/0_0_2282_1369/master/2282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92d8f824542a4266e50c67567b118bf9","title":"forgive me daytime tv roxanne pallett loose women coleen nolan age of sorry","story":"Before the legendary David Letterman was the king of American late-night TV, he got his big break with a mid-morning chatshow that stood out for its refusal to take the entire medium of telly seriously. In one episode, Letterman had a TV wheeled on to the set, and proceeded to flick through what was on the other channels and watch those instead. Rival broadcasts were cynically mocked, his own show seemingly forgotten.Imagine this, but stripped of all wit, humour and scepticism – and instead infused with the kind of clinical self-regard that says: this shit is really important. Congratulations! You’re now picturing the UK’s present daytime schedule. Whole swathes of today’s television programmes are frequently taken up with people apologising for things they said, or did, on other television programmes. Whole sections of shows involve the solemn watching of clips from other shows, with those featured in the first show wheeled on to the next show to defend or prostrate themselves.Did you do something bad on Celebrity Big Brother? Then you must proceed straight to Loose Women and give your director’s commentary. Did you say something bad on Loose Women? Then you must go on This Morning. Do you wish to clarify the comments you made during your This Morning car crash? Then you need Good Morning Britain. Also, Celebrity Big Brother will be in touch. It doesn’t matter that you’ve already been on – they’re doing a Legends edition of the format next time.To the old programming isions, then – drama, news, lifestyle and so on – is added this monster new category: penance. I\u0026nbspdon’t know who ITV’s Controller of\u0026nbspPenance is, but it’s arguably the biggest job in telly. The department certainly dwarfs BBC Comedy.By way of an example, let’s follow a couple of active cases through the machine. Last week, Celebrity Big Brother contestant Roxanne Pallett claimed that fellow contestant Ryan Thomas punched her. Except he didn’t, and the reason everyone knows this is that Celebrity Big Brother is literally a show where people are filmed from all angles all the time. They have … a lot of CCTV, you know?Even so, the incident has sparked 25,000 complaints to Ofcom, with the figure rising all the time, despite the fact that Roxanne left the house a week ago. Twenty-five thousand! I\u0026nbsphad no idea 25,000 people even knew what Ofcom was. I myself had always hoped to make it through without ever finding out. Anyway, the penance process has decided that the only way she can save her career is by being forced to watch the incident on other programmes while begging forgiveness.She duly went on Jeremy Vine’s new Channel 5 show – but clips of this appearance were promptly aired on Loose Women and attacked. That’s what you get, Roxanne, for purchasing your indulgence from Jeremy and not Loose Women. “There is nothing she could say,” concluded Loose Women’s Denise Welch, “that could convince me that this wasn’t the most horrific thing I’ve seen on television.” I could read that quote a\u0026nbspthousand times, and aspects of it would still be unfurling themselves to me like an exquisite lotus blossom.Or perhaps you prefer another live\u0026nbspconflict, with its epicentre in the\u0026nbspvery Loose Women studios themselves? Another of the panel, Coleen Nolan, was apparently on Celebrity Big Brother with How Clean Is Your House presenter Kim Woodburn more than a year ago, and\u0026nbspthey didn’t get on. Kim was invited on to Loose Women last week, presumably in the hope that any unexploded ordnance might be detonated. Janet Street-Porter – dressed as a judge – sat between her and Coleen. Unfortunately, so much #conflict was created that Kim walked off the set and, at time of writing, many thousands of complaints had\u0026nbspbeen made to … hang on, I’ve forgotten it again … UK broadcast regulator Ofcom.Coleen herself is now too upset to\u0026nbspappear on her own show. But the Controller of Penance insisted she went on This Morning, and Coleen duly gave an interview to Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. (Holly will soon be co-presenting top-tier reparations format I’m A\u0026nbspCelebrity with Declan Donnelly, because Ant McPartlin has yet to schedule his comeback public apology interview for the bad things HE’S done.) Indeed, perhaps the network has the jungle in mind for Coleen, who has been feverishly linked with an appearance in the Queensland bush ever since the Loose Women row.In the meantime, Loose Women is\u0026nbsplocked out of its own shitstorm, forcing Coleen’s fellow panellist Street-Porter to hack in with a Daily Mail column about the drama. This has become a witchhunt, says Goody Street-Porter, who plies her trade on a programme that has ducked more women as witches than the entire European wars of religion. Goody Nolan is not a witch. This is “all the result of a few chaotic minutes of live television”, says Janet.But isn’t it always? I had assumed the slogan “A Few Chaotic Minutes of Live Television” was emblazoned above the tunnel leading from the Loose Women players’ dressing room and out on to that hallowed set. “A Few Chaotic Minutes of Live Television” is the “This is Anfield” of sexlife reveals, and of telling reality stars they’re no better than they should be, and of wanting to set the record straight about something nobody read in Now magazine.Was it ever thus? No, is the short answer. But around 2005, TV bosses decided that conflict was now the holy grail of all telly, and shows adjusted their booking requirements accordingly. In time, conflict became so central to the output that it frequently generated conflict that could not be contained within the theatre of war that had erupted. Secondary conflicts broke out and, in retrospect, it feels entirely inevitable that the assassination of\u0026nbspArchduke Kim Woodburn was always going to spark a chain of events involving many other parties and lasting until the Christmas schedule. The cycle resolves only temporarily, thanks to its final stage: the making of terrible peace treaties. Saying sorry, agreeing to\u0026nbspritual shamings and reparations, and smouldering until the next\u0026nbspoutbreak.And the audience becomes an ever more willing participant. Once,\u0026nbspcomplaints about things on the telly were the pursuit of the 55-plus advertising bracket, and might be expected to be driven by, say, the print edition of the Daily Mail. By the time of the Jonathan RossRussell Brand Sachsgate scandal, the pursuit had gone digital and spread to the 35-54 bracket. If the most recent Big Brother pile-on is any indicator, it has now engulfed even the 16-34 bracket.Without wishing to go out on a\u0026nbsplimb here, the days when it was cool to not care too much about anything are now some decades behind us. Caring far too much about everything is now regarded as\u0026nbspa badge of honour. Were you part of the 25,000-strong army who lost their minds about something that happened on Celebrity Big Brother? Are you desperately hoping that someone says the wrong word or\u0026nbspdoes the wrong thing on the forthcoming series of I’m a Celebrity, to recreate the thrill ride of dialling in en masse to the … hang on, it’s gone again … UK broadcast regulator\u0026nbspOfcom? Incredible that even Labour is too wet to advocate\u0026nbsplegalising cannabis when\u0026nbspwe all mainline dopamine every waking hour.If I were writing a telly history, I’d say the Age of Sorry comes after the Age of Reality (indeed, could not have come without it). Back in the early 2000s, the fact that some of the US networks differentiated their Vice Presidents of Scripted Reality from their Vice Presidents of Unscripted Reality seemed eyerollingly quaint. That, obviously, was back when the biggest reality star of the era wasn’t actually the leader of the free world. Quite where telly’s raging Age of Sorry will lead us is unclear, but the formbook suggests it won’t be pretty. In fact, it may well require a mass apology to all our descendants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d147222eaf1acaa2dbe5db7e4f91b8bce0bb046/37_30_4029_2417/master/4029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9796a39c97d0aa7a358748fa59ec0115","title":"what does energy price cap mean for households and firms","story":"From whether you should switch suppliers to how it could lead to job cuts More than half of households are on a default tariff, known as standard variable tariffs (SVT). If you are on one – and you probably are, if you haven’t switched in recent years – you will save money when the cap starts in late December. The exact amount depends on the supplier, region and energy usage. For example, those on Scottish Power’s SVT will save £121, while those on Ovo’s SVT will save only £14.Job cuts, probably. British Gas, EDF, E.ON, npower, Scottish Power and SSE will want to protect their profit margins. Some have already announced measures to become more efficient, which in most cases will mean job losses. Npower and the retail arm of SSE are merging, so they will have the additional costs of that to cope with.A source at one big supplier said: “You’ll see profits from the sector wiped out next year.” One other possible consequence is that large suppliers’ fixed deals will get slightly more expensive, although experts think any rises would be modest to avoid firms pricing themselves out of the market.Overall, the cap is bad news for the big suppliers, however they try to adapt. If they cut jobs and customer service suffers, or put up their teaser tariffs too much, they will lose consumers even faster to smaller players than they are already.The cap is set at £1,136 a year, based on typical usage for a direct debit customer on a dual fuel SVT . For those who pay by cash or cheque – so-called standard credit customers, who cost firms more to serve – the cap is slightly higher at £1,219. Ofgem will decide twice a year whether to change the ceiling. The cap is due to expire at the end of 2020 but could be extended until the end of 2023. Ofgem admitted it has not yet developed criteria to measure the “effective competition” to decide whether or not the cap should be extended or ended by the business secretary of the day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5780bcecbeca2a05aa308f8791c0bdc19cafaa41/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=190189ad164e877c44ff8a3e71342271","title":"britpop is back whats behind the 90s music revival","story":"This summer’s Cool Britannia festival showed there is a huge appetite for re-formed 90s bands, including the Bluetones, Echobelly and Sleeper. Was the music really that good – or do people just want nostalgia during uncertain times?Backstage at the Cool Britannia festival earlier this month, David Heartfield and Jack Gray are explaining why the moment is right for a 90s revival. But they would say that, wouldn’t they? They are the promoter and the booking agent of Cool Britannia, a two-day event in the grounds of Knebworth House that offers nostalgic punters a cornucopia of musical delights from 20 years ago. There’s a dance tent with PAs from Rozalla, Urban Cookie Collective and Alison Limerick, among others, but the main stage skews distinctly towards Britpop: Ocean Colour Scene, Cast, Dodgy, Toploader, the Lightning Seeds and something called Britpop Classical, an alt-rock equivalent of those tours where an orchestra belts out old dance hits to an audience of ageing ravers, complete with Phil Daniels reprising his monologue from Blur’s Parklife.As we speak, Space are on stage. They have visibly been on an intriguing journey since the mainstream spotlight left them – they now have a keyboard player in a Crass T-shirt and a bass player who looks like he is moonlighting from a death metal act called something like Mildewed Crucifix – but the audience are lapping up their 90s hits: Avenging Angels, Female of the Species, Neighbourhood.Heartfield’s and Gray’s argument about a 90s revival is, in fact, a convincing one. They used to run Rewind, the 80s nostalgia festival that grew from a one-off 2009 show in Henley-on-Thames into a global brand, with three annual UK festivals and franchises in South Africa, Thailand and the UAE. But two years ago, Heartfield sold Rewind – for £30m – convinced that the 80s revival phenomenon had reached its peak and the 90s was the new growth area. The 80s market is saturated, says Heartfield: “It’s at every sports ground, the end of every pier.” And the core audience is getting on a bit. When Rewind started, punters were in their 40s. “They’ve procreated, the kids are a bit older and they’ve reached that point where there’s more of a tendency to look back,” he adds. But now they are 10 years older and beginning to suffer from what he calls “festival burnout syndrome”. “The physical desire to go out and rave it up isn’t as strong. They probably don’t want to camp as much – however many theme bars, luxury loos and glamping areas you put in, there’s still an element of roughing it.”Besides, says Gray, every major 80s act that was going to return has returned, “and there’s only so many times people want to see the same bands”. By contrast, there’s a novelty factor in seeing Britpop-era bands, who have been reforming in recent years (“Space are back, the Bluetones are back”), and he hopes to persuade others: “I would love to get Elastica back together, or Supergrass I’d love to see a Welsh version of this festival with iconic bands like Catatonia.He starts to explain the mechanics of rebuilding an unfashionable band’s live career, but is interrupted by a disconcerting but highly distinctive sound emanating from nearby. “That’ll be Heather Small warming up,” he nods. Indeed it is: the voice of M People is practising her scales in the backstage bar. As if to complete the time-warp atmosphere, when I look up, Alan McGee walks past. He is here as the manager of Cast, but he also recently reanimated the 90s’ most celebrated indie label, Creation.Unfashionable as Britpop may seem in 2018 – with its propensity for flag-waving parochialism (which feels discomfiting in the age of Brexit) and its laddish atmosphere (the kind of thing that gets called out in an era more wary of casual sexism) – you don’t have to search far for evidence of renewed interest. With its luxe food stalls and stately home setting, Cool Britannia is just the most upmarket of a host of Britpop-centred festivals. There’s Star Shaped, organised by a club that advertises itself as “truly the home of Britpop”. It has grown from a single event at the Garage venue in London into three annual gigs – the others are in Glasgow and Manchester.Shiiine On, meanwhile, organises one-day events, mini-cruises and an annual three-day festival at Minehead Butlin’s, where past attractions included not merely live appearances by the Bluetones, Echobelly, Menswear and Ash, but Oasis and Blur tribute acts and a performance of Girl from Mars, a “Britpop jukebox musical” featuring “all the biggest anthems from Oasis, Pulp and Blur wrapped up in a sci-fi storyline” with a heroine modelled on Saffron from Republica.It is clear that the era’s bands are indeed reforming or reactivating their recording careers to a noticeably warm reception. Last year, Shed Seven’s first album since 2001, Instant Pleasures, was critically well received and made the Top 10 Embrace reconvened after a lengthy sabbatical from recording in 2014 and both their subsequent albums debuted in the Top 5. “Our fanbase is amazing – they’re just so loyal,” says the band’s guitarist Richard McNamara, while waiting for his band’s turn on the Cool Britannia stage. “We’ve always been kind of the underdogs – we never really got the recognition that they all think we deserved – so that sort of magnetises them to us a bit more.”Louise Wener tells me she had no intention of re-forming Sleeper: her partner Andy, the band’s drummer, sold his kit because it was taking up space in the attic and “we’d said there was absolutely no chance we’ll ever go back and do it again”. Then she received an offer to perform at the 2017 Star Shaped festival. “Under ordinary circumstances, I probably would never even have opened the email, but it came in the middle of a really sad year – someone really close to me got very ill in 2017 – and I just had this feeling that it would be life-affirming and out of our comfort zone – and I sort of agreed to it without even talking to the others.”She says the band intended to “literally do four gigs and put everything back under the tarpaulin again”. Instead, the reaction was such that Sleeper now find themselves recording a new album with the producer Stephen Street and embarking on a UK tour, the dates carefully arranged on weekends to avoid clashing with parenting commitments. “It’s all about: ‘Will we enjoy it? Will it be fun for us?’ not: ‘What does it represent? What does it mean, what will the comments be?’ – none of us could have cared less. At this age, when you have had kids, it would seem ridiculous to have that acute self-consciousness that you develop in the music industry when you first start out. There’s none of that. Which is lovely, obviously.”Both Wener and McNamara tell me that their current audience is almost entirely composed of people who remember them from the first time around – or, Wener laughs, “kids who have come with their parents and come up to you and go: ‘Oh my God, my dad used to play this in the car on the way to school.’ – which makes you feel completely ancient”.It’s the same at Cool Britannia. The crowd’s age is almost entirely between 35 and 50, kids in tow notwithstanding. Every audience member I speak to cleaves to the rosy-hued slogan on one woman’s T-shirt: “It Was Better in the 90s”. I hear a lot of stuff about it being “the last great era for songwriting”, which is either evidence of people buying into Britpop’s own self-mythologising or a reflection of the fact that these are thin times for what one punter calls “honest guitar music”, crowded out of the marketplace by rap, dance and pop. Or perhaps it’s the sound of what a recent survey conducted by Spotify referred to as the “taste freeze”, a point where people stop keeping up with trends in music.Whether you agree with that thinking or not, it’s easy to see why people may feel impelled to retreat to their youth in 2018. We live in uncertain, even terrifying, times. You can’t really blame people for wanting to temporarily wallow in a world before ubiquitous social media, 911 and the “war on terror” when Donald Trump was just a blowhard American businessman, Boris Johnson couldn’t get elected to parliament and the prefix “alt” was attached to the word “rock” rather than “right”. Of course, the 90s weren’t that wonderful, musically or socially, but that’s what nostalgia is: a form of curation where you cut the crap bits out.He is not the only person who thinks that a Britpop revival may find a younger audience. Martin James, a professor of music industries at Solent University in Southampton, is keen to point out that he “never got Britpop personally”, but has a wealth of empirical evidence of students enthralled by the era. He has a theory that 17- to 20-year-olds are eager to distinguish themselves from their YouTuber-obsessed younger siblings by listening to music that is considered “authentic” and slightly arcane.Retro-revivalism is almost as old as rock’n’roll itself. The first example may have come when a record store called Times Square opened in a New York subway station, specialising in “oldies” – forgotten mid-50s vocal-group singles in a style that would come to be known as “doo-wop”. Its customers were teenagers convinced that the golden age of rock’n’roll was a thing of the past. It was 1959.It then runs through the history of British rock and pop. There was a 50s revival in the early 70s that found its expression in everything from the 1972 London Rock’n’Roll Show at Wembley stadium to glam rock, with T Rex’s mangled Chuck Berry riffs and the teddy boy garb sported by Roy Wood’s Wizzard. The early 80s variously hosted a mod revival, Two Tone’s repurposing of 60s ska, a gush of Motown-inspired pop singles by the Maisonettes and Mari Wilson – the beehive-sporting “Neasden queen of soul” – and a short-lived psychedelic revival.Martin James points out that “a rush to nostalgia” has a habit of coinciding with a harsh economic climate, and that Britpop’s own brand of revivalism – a reverential grab-bag of historical influences from mid-60s rock, glam and new wave – wasn’t a product of the early years of New Labour: it was fomented by the early 90s recession, a time of “mass unemployment and students graduating into debt because of the introduction of student loans”. Faced with a grim-looking present, James suggests, people tend to “stretch back to some form of safety, the things they have grown up with, trying to make it their own”.If you buy James’s theory, it makes sense that some young people, confronted by the economic and social realities of 2018, may find themselves stretching back to music they vaguely recall from somewhere in their childhood. In the mainstream, there’s the platinum-selling success of Liam Gallagher’s solo album As You Were – from its title down, a defiant restatement of what you might call Oasis’s core values – and the fact that, when England unexpectedly reached the semi-finals of the World Cup this summer, the song people automatically reached for was Britpop-era anthem Three Lions. Clearly, not everyone who sent it to No 1 in July was a fortysomething nostalgic.Scratch beneath the surface and James’s point becomes stronger still. The website for This Feeling – a hugely successful club night with outposts across the UK – features dozens of bands audibly devoted to a Britpop era they look too young to remember: the Novatones, Shader, the Vanities, the Spitfires. Back at Cool Britannia, no one in the crowd seems bothered about how far a 90s revival will spread. There are more pressing concerns: Embrace are on soon. The DJ plays Blur’s End of the Century and all around me, unprompted, everyone starts happily singing along."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48a24c4e7d5bd1ce04e0b8bee490c6fad6d617e9/793_0_1718_1032/master/1718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=788f907b4cd897044a8327ff9d37a20c","title":"prince 17 days lost masterpiece exclusive demo","story":"First available exclusively here, the 1983 piano demo of Prince song 17 Days is a gospel-influenced gem – and as co-writer Lisa Coleman says, a portrait of a man on the brink of megastardom‘It’s extraordinary. It’s not polished. It’s personal. It feels like you’re in the room with him,” says Prince and the Revolution keyboard playervocalist Lisa Coleman, describing the previously unreleased recording of 17 Days. The track is an exclusive preview of the forthcoming Prince album, Piano \u0026amp A Microphone 1983, which captures the star solo, tinkling the ivories and singing in his home studio.17 Days began life that same year in a warehouse outside Minneapolis. As Prince and the Revolution began rehearsals, Coleman started playing organ with a reggae feel. “And we just started jamming on that,” the musician remembers. “Prince really liked it and we worked on it all day. The ‘ha ha ha’ backing vocals came quickly. I think he had the lyrics the next day. He always worked pretty quickly.” Thus, according to Coleman, the subsequent piano session – which also features an embryonic Purple Rain – consists of Prince “really getting to know the songs more personally. Getting them into his body.”Prince Rogers Nelson is well-known for his singing, songwriting, guitar playing and dancing, but perhaps less so for his piano skills, which make these tracks such fascinating insight into his creative process. 17 Days seems to contain hints of New Orleans jazz and classical. “He came from the church, so his gospel and soul playing was instinctive,” Coleman explains. “But then he would be attracted to more harmonically complex or jazz things or things with more space, like Joni Mitchell.” A cover of the folk singer-songwriter’s A Case of You appears on the album along with a skeletal version of the key Prince track Strange Relationship, a song Coleman says “hung around for years” before he eventually recorded it for Sign O’ the Times. “He was amazing with his output but he didn’t leave a lot unfinished,” Coleman says. “So he could have a song for ages and suddenly start playing it again and say, ‘Let’s do something with this!’ He was fast but he was also careful.”“He sang the part of the lonely person a lot, like When You Were Mine or The Beautiful Ones. Even though he’s got the prowess of a” – she laughs – “love god, an incredible kind of fantasy person, at the same time he was like a deer in headlights, a very vulnerable person. Those big brown eyes would kill you. But he struggled with his success. One of the reasons he stayed in Minnesota all his life is that it allowed him a little bit of freedom. It was hard after Purple Rain, because it was limos and planes and thousands of people, all the time. I think it was hard for him to decide when he could just be Prince, the guy, and when he had to become Prince the superstar. He gave himself so thoroughly to it.”Indeed, in some ways the Piano \u0026amp A Microphone 1983 recordings mark the start of that transition from star to global megastar, which he became after 1984’s Purple Rain.“Absolutely,” Coleman says. “He was working day in, day out at being something great. If that meant recording himself at the piano and studying it later he would do it. He would observe himself: recordings, videos, mirrors around the house. He’d dance himself so hard, practising spinning around, the splits, high heels, everything. He wanted to make sure that when the time came – and he was going to make that time come – he would be something that would make the world go, ‘Wow.’”• Piano \u0026amp A Microphone 1983 is released on 21 September.

Now, only money counts. China’s leading novelist examines a nation that has transformed in a single lifetime. By  Yu HuaWhen I try to describe how China has changed over the past 50 years, countless roads appear in front of me. Given the sheer immensity of these changes, all I can do is try first to follow a couple of main roads, and then a few smaller ones, to see where they take us.My first main road begins in the past. In my 58 years, I have experienced three dramatic changes, and each one has been accompanied by a surge in suicides among officials. The first time was during Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966. At the start of that period, many members of the Chinese Communist party woke up one day to find they had been purged: overnight they had become “power-holders taking the capitalist road”. After suffering every kind of psychological and physical abuse, some chose to take their own lives. In the small town in south China where I grew up, some hanged themselves or swallowed insecticide, while others threw themselves down wells: wells in south China have narrow mouths, and if you e into one headfirst, there is no way you will come out alive.In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, many people from the lowest tiers of society formed their own mass organisations, proclaiming themselves commanders of a “Cultural Revolution headquarters”. These iniduals – rebels, they were called – often went on to secure official positions of one kind or another. They enjoyed only a brief career, however. Following Mao’s death in 1976, the subsequent end of the Cultural Revolution and the emergence of the reform-minded Deng Xiaoping as China’s new leader, some rebels believed they would suffer just as much as the officials they had tormented a few years before.Thus came the second surge in suicides – this time of officials who had clawed their way to power as revolutionary radicals. One official in my little town drowned himself in the sea: he smoked a lot of cigarettes first, and the stubs littering the shore marked the agony of indecision that preceded his death. This was a much smaller surge in suicides than the first one, because Deng was not out for political revenge, focusing instead on kickstarting economic reforms and opening up to the west. This policy led in turn to China’s economic miracle, the downside of which has been environmental pollution, growing inequality and pervasive corruption.In late 2012 came the third dramatic change in my lifetime, when China entered the era of Xi Jinping. No sooner did Xi become general secretary of the Communist party than our new leader launched an anti-corruption drive, the scale and force of which took almost everyone by surprise. The third surge in suicides followed. When officials who had stuffed their pockets during China’s breakneck economic rise discovered they were being investigated and realised they could not wriggle free, some put an end to things by suicide. In cases involving lower-ranking officials who were under investigation but had not yet been taken into custody, the government explanation was that their suicides were triggered by depression. But, if a high-ranking official took his own life, a harsher judgment was passed. On 23 November 2017, after Zhang Yang, a general, hanged himself in his own home, the People’s Liberation Army Daily reported that he “had evaded party discipline and the laws of the nation” and described his suicide as “a disgraceful action”.These three surges in suicide demonstrate the failure and impotence of legal institutions in China. The public security organs, prosecutorial agencies and courts all stopped functioning at the start of the Cultural Revolution thereafter, laws existed only in name. Since Mao’s death, a robust legal system has never truly been established and, today, law’s failure manifests itself in two ways. First, the law is strong only on paper: in practice, law tends to be subservient to the power that officials wield. Second, when officials realise they are being investigated and know their position won’t save them, some will choose to die rather than submit to legal sanctions, for officials who believe in power don’t believe in law.These two points, seemingly at odds, are actually two sides of the same coin. The difference between the three surges in suicide is this: the first two were outcomes of a political struggle framed by the start and the end of the Cultural Revolution. The third, by contrast, stems from the blight of corruption that has accompanied 30 years of rapid economic development. Some argue, of course, that the anti-corruption campaign is conducted selectively, with the goal of purging Xi Jinping’s political opponents. But the underlying problem is: how many officials are there today who are truly clean? A few years ago, an official from China’s prosecutorial agencies put it to me this way: “If you were to stick all of today’s officials in a line and shoot every one of them, that would be unfair to some. But a lot would slip through the net if you only shot every other one.”When I turn onto the second main road that stretches from the China of my childhood to the present day, what I see before me is the declining importance of the family and the growing importance of inidualism. In Mao’s China, the inidual could find no fulfilment in ordinary social life. If one wanted to express a personal aspiration, the only way to do so was to throw oneself into a collective movement such as the Great Leap Forward or the Cultural Revolution. Mind you, in those grand campaigns, the inidual’s aspirations had to conform entirely to whatever the “correct” political line happened to be at that moment – the slightest deviation would cause disaster.To use an analogy current at the time, each of us was a little drop of water, gathered into the great flood of socialism. But it wasn’t so easy to be that drop of water. In my town, there was a Cultural Revolution activist who would almost every day be at the forefront of some demonstration or other, often being first to raise his fist and shout “Down with Liu Shaoqi!” (Liu, nominally the head of state, had just been purged.) One day, however, he inadvertently misspoke, shouting “Down with Mao Zedong!” instead. Within seconds he had been thrown to the ground by the “revolutionary masses”, and thus he began a wretched phase in life, denounced and beaten at every turn.In that era, the inidual could find space only in the context of family life – any independent leanings could only be expressed at home. That is why family values were so important to Chinese people then, and why marital infidelity was seen as so intolerable. If you were caught having an extramarital affair, the social morality of the day meant that you would be subjected to all kinds of humiliation: you might be paraded through the streets with half your hair shaved off or packed off to prison.During the Cultural Revolution, there were certainly cases of husbands and wives denouncing each other and fathers and sons falling out, but these were not typical – the vast majority of families enjoyed unprecedented solidarity. A friend of mine told me her father had been a professor at the start of the Cultural Revolution, while her mother was a housewife. Her father, born to a landlord’s family, became the target of attacks, but her mother, from a humbler background, was placed among the revolutionary ranks. Pressed by the radicals to orce her father, her mother outright refused – and not only that: every time her father was hauled off to a denunciation session, she would make a point of sitting in the front row and, if she saw someone beating her husband, she would rush over and start hitting back. Such brawls might leave her bruised and bleeding, but she would sit back down proudly in the front row, and the radicals lost their nerve and gave up beating her husband. After the Cultural Revolution ended, my friend’s father told her, with tears in his eyes, that had it not been for her mother he might well have taken his own life. There are many such stories.After Mao’s death, the economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping brought dramatic changes to China, changes that permeated all levels of Chinese society. In a matter of 30 years, we went from one extreme to another, from an era where human nature was suppressed to an era where human impulses could run riot, from an era when politics was paramount to an era when only money counts.Before, limited by social constraints, people could feel a modicum of freedom only within the family with the loss of those constraints, that modest freedom which was once so prized now counts for little. Extramarital affairs have become more and more widespread and are no longer a cause for shame. It is commonplace for successful men to keep a mistress, or sometimes multiple mistresses – which people often jokingly compare to a teapot needing at least four or five cups to make a full tea set. In one case I know of, a wealthy businessman bought all 10 flats in the wing of an apartment complex. He installed his legally recognised wife in one flat, and his nine legally unrecognised mistresses in the other flats, one above the other, so that he could select at his pleasure and convenience on which floor of the building he would spend the night.Having taken a couple of main roads that trace China’s journey over the past half-century, it is time to travel down some smaller ones. The first begins with Buddhist temples. During the Cultural Revolution, temples were closed down and some suffered serious damage. In my little town, Red Guards knocked off the heads and arms of every Buddhist sculpture in the local temples, which were then converted into storehouses. Afterwards, the damaged temples were restored and they all reopened, typically with two round bronze incense burners in front of the main hall: the first to invoke blessings for wealth, the second to invoke blessings for security.When I visited temples in the 1980s, in the first censer I would often see a huge assembly of joss sticks, blazing away furiously, while in the second, a paltry handful would be smoking feebly. In those days China was still very poor, and, as most people saw it, when you didn’t have money, being safe didn’t amount to much. Now China is rich, and when you go into a temple you see joss sticks burning just as brightly in the security censer as in the wealth one – it is when you are rich that security acquires particular importance.In China today, Buddhist temples are crowded with worshippers, while Taoist temples are largely deserted. A few years ago, I asked a Taoist abbot: “Taoism is native to China, so why is it not as popular as Buddhism, which came here from abroad?” His answer was short: “Buddhism has money and Taoism doesn’t.”His explanation, although it rather took me aback, expresses a truth about Chinese society: money, or material interest, has become the main motivating force. In the 1980s, there was a series of student protests in China, culminating in the Tiananmen demonstrations of 1989, when not just students but city dwellers all across the country joined the rallies. Back then, the demonstrations were largely motivated by concern for the fate of the nation and a desire to see democratic freedoms put in place. Today, people still demonstrate, but on a very small scale, and these demonstrations – “mass incidents” in official parlance – are completely different from the protests in the 1980s. Protests today are not geared towards transforming society – they are simply designed to protect the material interests of the group involved.A few years ago, in the eastern province of Jiangsu, the education authorities announced that universities would be reserving more places for students from poor areas in west China. This triggered an uproar among the parents of Jiangsu high-school students preparing for the university entrance examination. Concerned that this new policy would reduce their children’s chances of getting into university, they marched in the streets to protest. Something similar happened a few years ago in Shanghai, when retirees took to the streets, worried that if welfare funds were allocated to poor areas, their own retirement benefits would be slashed.These constant “mass incidents”, I should point out, reflect real issues. In recent years, for instance, many retired military veterans have gathered together across the country in protests against the stingy benefits and pensions they receive from the state. Back in the 1980s, they argue, veterans used to be more generously rewarded, relative to the cost of living. Today, even though China is richer, they receive little. Unsurprisingly, veterans feel shortchanged and disrespected.Other mass incidents, such as the widespread demonstrations by truck drivers in June, have been sparked by the fierce economic competition that now characterises life in China. In numerous industries, it has become common practice to try to secure more business by pushing down prices as low as they can possibly go. I was struck by this new reality a few years ago, at the end of a trip I had taken to South Africa for the World Cup. At the airport, I bought a vuvuzela in the airport as a souvenir, paying more than 100 yuan (£11). It was only when I got back to Beijing that I realised it was made in China. At the start, Chinese manufacturers had set their factory price at over five yuan a piece, but they soon found themselves being underbid. Some factories ultimately set their price as low as 2.2 yuan, when the production cost was 2 yuan per unit. The result of all this ferocious competition is that the profit margin keeps getting slimmer and slimmer, and those who suffer most are ordinary workers, who often see no increase in their salary even as their work hours are extended.Now I need to take two other roads – the road of innovation and the road of nostalgia. Innovation first. Given the speed at which new technologies become dominant, you sometimes feel that there is no gap at all between new and old. Take mobile payments: in the space of just a few years, Alibaba’s Alipay mobile app and Tencent’s WeChat Pay app have been loaded on to practically every smartphone in the country. From big shopping malls to little corner shops – any place where a transaction can be made will have the scannable QR codes for these two payment platforms displayed in a prominent location. People just need to take their phone out of their pocket, do a quick scan and the payment is made. Even Chinese beggars have to keep up with the times: sometimes they too have a QR code handy, and they will ask passersby to scan it and use the mobile payment platform to dispense some spare change.I recently went for more than a year without using cash or a credit card, because it is just so convenient to pay by phone instead. This July, though, when my English translator came to Beijing and my wife and I took him out for dinner, I went to scan the restaurant’s QR code but the transaction failed to go through. Instead of trying a second time, I suddenly felt an urge to pay in cash. When I pulled some banknotes out of my pocket, handed them to the cashier and received change in return, I felt a pleasant tingle of novelty.This novelty is all the more remarkable given that just 30 years ago, when Chinese people went on business trips, they would worry so much about their money being stolen that they would hide cash in their underpants, the safest place for it. They would have a little pocket sewn on the inside, with a button for extra security. When a bill needed to be paid they would reach a hand into their underwear, grope around a bit, and pull out the requisite five-mao or one-yuan note, distinguishable by feel because one was smaller than the other. Women would withdraw to a secluded spot to retrieve their cash, but some men would have no such inhibitions and would rummage about in their underpants quite unabashedly.When I turn to the road of nostalgia, I think of how my home county of Haiyan has transformed. When I was a boy, Haiyan had a total population of 300,000, with only 8,000 living in the county town itself. Now, the county has a population of 380,000, of whom 100,000 live in the county seat. Urbanisation has created a lot of problems, one of them being what happens after farmers move to cities. Local governments have expropriated large swathes of agricultural land to enable an enormous urban expansion program: some of the land is allocated to industry in order to attract investment, build factories and boost government revenues, but most of it is sold off at a high price to real-estate developers. The result is that high-rise apartment buildings now sprout in profusion where once only crops grew. After their land and houses in the countryside are expropriated, farmers “move upstairs” into housing blocks that the local government has provided in compensation. In wealthy counties, some farmers may be awarded up to three or four apartments, in which case they will live in one and rent out the other two or three others may receive a large cash settlement.But the questions then become: how do they adjust to city life? Now disconnected from the form of labour to which they were accustomed, what new jobs are there for them to do? Some drive taxis and some open little shops, but others just loaf around, playing mahjong all day, and others take to gambling and lose everything they have. Every time a community of dispossessed farmers settles into a new housing project, gambling operations will follow them there, because some of the residents will be flush with cash after the government payouts. In China, it is forbidden to open gambling establishments, but this doesn’t stop unlicensed operators from cramming their gambling accessories into a few large suitcases and lugging them around these new neighbourhoods, where they will talk their way into the homes of resettled farmers. The gambling outfits play hide-and-seek with the police, setting up shop here today, shifting to a new spot tomorrow.What is the situation back where the farmers came from – the houses in the countryside now expropriated but yet to be demolished? Peasants often have dogs to protect the home and guard the property. When peasants move to the cities, they no longer need guard dogs, so they leave them behind. And so you see poignant scenes in those empty, weed-infested farm compounds, as those abandoned dogs, all skin and bones, faithfully continue to perform sentry duty, now rushing from one end of the property to the other, standing on a high point and gazing off into the distance, their eyes burning with hope, longing for the past to return.Wishing the past could return is a mood that is spreading through today’s society. Two patterns are typical. The more widespread of the two reflects the yearnings of the poor. China’s enhanced status as the world’s second largest economy has brought them few benefits they continue to lead a life of grinding hardship. They cherish their memories of the past, for although they were poor then, the word “unemployed” was yet to exist. What’s more, in those days there was no moneyed class in a real sense: Mao’s monthly salary, for example, was just 404.8 yuan, compared to my parents’ joint income of 120 yuan. There was only a small gap between rich and poor, and social inequalities were limited.A different form of nostalgia is prevalent among successful people who, having risen as high as they can possibly go, now find themselves in danger of tumbling off the cliff. Someone reported to me an exchange he had had with one of Shanghai’s ultra-rich, a man who had relied on bribery and other underhand methods to transform himself from a pauper into a millionaire. Realising he would soon be arrested and anticipating a long prison term, he stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows of his huge, lofty, luxurious office and looked down at the construction workers far below, busy building the foundation of another skyscraper. How he wished he could be one of those workers, he said, for though their work was hard and their pay was low, they didn’t have to live in a state of such high anxiety. Faced with the prospect of losing everything they have gained, such people find themselves wishing their spectacular career hadn’t happened at all, wishing they could reclaim the past.If the past were really to return – that past where you needed grain coupons to buy rice, oil coupons to buy cooking oil, cotton coupons to buy cloth, that past of dire material shortages, where the supply of goods was dictated by quotas – would those people who hanker for the past be happy? I doubt it.As I see it, when the poor pine for the past, this is not a rational desire – it is simply a way of venting their feelings, the voicing of a frustration that is rooted in their discontent with current Chinese realities. And when that other, smaller group of people who have been successful in government or business realise they are going to spend the rest of their life behind bars and wish they could reclaim the past, this sentiment springs only from a wistful regret: “If I had known this was going to happen, I wouldn’t have got myself into this mess.”I’m reminded of a joke that’s been doing the rounds. Here is what’s unfair about this society:The pretty girl says: “I want a diamond ring!” She gets it.The rich guy says: “I want a pretty girl!” He gets her.I say: “I want a shower!” But there’s no water.That last situation, I myself have experienced. In my early years, more often than not, water would cut off just as I was having a shower – sometimes at the precise moment when I had lathered myself in soap from head to toe. All I could do then was hammer on the pipe with my fists, at the same time raising my head so that the final few drops of water would rinse my eyes and save them from smarting as for when the water would come on again, I could only wait patiently and hope heaven was on my side. Back then, nobody would have seen water stoppages at shower-time as a social injustice, because in those bygone days, there were no rich guys, and so pretty girls didn’t get diamond rings and rich guys didn’t get pretty girls.It is often said that children represent the future. In closing, let me try to capture the changing outlook of three generations of Chinese boys as a way of mapping in simple terms China’s trajectory over the years. If you asked these boys what to look for in life, I think you would hear very different answers.A boy growing up in the Cultural Revolution might well have said: “Revolution and struggle.”A boy growing up in the early 1990s, as economic reforms entered their second decade, might well have said: “Career and love.”Today’s boy might well say: “Money and girls.”Translated by Allan H Barr• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb2056db3e76ce4957ee30395f8d8844901cd857/0_0_7276_4856/master/7276.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d7a7bc2841def911b9e1debe3b7a4a42 1760w","title":"ireland hopes side deal with eu could allow it friction free trade across border","story":"Deal would allow UK to be used as friction-free ‘land bridge’ for goods going to Dublin from EUIreland is hoping to seal a special Brexit side deal in Brussels allowing it to continue using the UK as a “land bridge” for goods in transit to Dublin without border checks, a senior Irish tax official has revealed.Speaking at a British and Irish Chambers of Commerce conference in Dublin, she also revealed that the Irish government was pressing ahead with detailed plans for customs and health checks in Irish ports and airports in the event of no deal.Food and public health checks had to be carried out at the border, she said. “They are not allowed outside the border.”The conference heard that the much-vaunted “trusted trader” status in the Chequers plan that would supposedly allow goods to travel friction-free across borders, particularly the Irish border, was of “no benefit” to agrifood traders as they would be subject to “mandatory checks”.O’Keeffe said she had no knowledge of what the UK was planning to implement on its side of the border. “That’s their own call, they are not going to be bound by EU law,” she said.Although she said she could not speak about north-south plans as this was part of the political negotiations, she warned that the “trusted trader” certificate might not suit everyone in the supply chain because it was costly and had to be kept up to date. It would also take nine months to obtain, the conference heard.O’Keeffe also said that customs declaration forms were long and detailed and not just a box-ticking exercise declaring goods and their origin and destination.“It’s all electronic. We aren’t talking papers and stamps, but it is a 54-box declaration … If you want to clear your goods speedily, we will be saying you must submit it and you must submit it in advance,” she said.Dublin will face the same burden of health checks as Calais for plants, food and animal feed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d633300c1d553dc3bf82c6e31a2e102f5f2861d5/0_89_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=858fa7766edd90a723ff9bac53450bd7","title":"jesus herrada takes red jersey simon yates vuelta stage 12 cycling","story":"• Spaniard rides to three minutes-plus lead over Simon Yates• Alexandre Geniez pips Team Sky’s Dylan van Baarle to victoryThe Spanish rider Jesús Herrada became the overall leader of the Vuelta a España on Thursday while the Frenchman Alexandre Geniez won stage 12 with a nail-biting sprint to the finish line as he pipped Team Sky’s Dylan van Baarle to victory.Cofidis’ Herrada took the red jersey from Britain’s Simon Yates after joining a second breakaway group that finished 2min 32sec behind Geniez and over nine minutes ahead of Yates and the other general classification hopefuls.Herrada holds an impressive lead of 3min 32sec over Yates, who slipped to second place, while Alejandro Valverde is now third, a further second behind, and Nairo Quintana is down to fourth.Geniez edged ahead in the final few metres of the 180.1km flat stage from Mondoñedo to Faro de Estaca de Bares to beat Van Baarle by half a wheel and grab a third victory at the Vuelta after winning stages in 2013 and 2016.There was further pain for Van Baarle, who looked visibly disappointed at narrowly missing out on the stage win and crashed into a photographer shortly after crossing the finish line.The Vuelta returns to the mountains in Friday’s stage 13, a 174.8km route from Candás Carreno to La Camperona with a summit finish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/247dd57d5bb89a64f5f8224524895723461d8c1e/0_24_3565_2139/master/3565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ca429c05eea38d1934194122803d247","title":"new york mets todd frazier rubber ball catch umpire la dodgers","story":"After an awful first-half of the season, the New York Mets have had a respectable few months, topped off by a series win at the Los Angeles Dodgers this week.

Lean, dignified, quick to smile and forever diligent in the way he goes about his business – combatting the new ball so that the fancy Dans down the order can have some fun – he will make his way to the middle to warm applause. The spotlight is on Keaton Jennings.After five days at the Oval, Jennings may well become England’s senior opener, charged with passing on a few handy hints to whoever joins him at the top of the order in November at Galle in Sri Lanka, where the first Test of the winter takes place on a pitch likely to be more venomous than the one recently seen in Ciderabad (aka Taunton), just west of Bridgwater, for Somerset’s tied match with Lancashire.To be sure of his place Jennings needs the ballast of some runs in the final Test to bolster a very mediocre record, albeit in a summer when opening the batting for England has been the second hardest task any ECB employee has had to undertake – after selling The Hundred. (Jennings, by the way, does not need to produce fireworks to convince crease occupation will do.) This is a crucial Test for him even though his chances of staying in the Test team this winter are greatly enhanced by the departure of his senior partner.OK, an amendment may now be in order. All the selectors’ eyes may be on Jennings at the Oval. Everyone else will be focused upon Alastair Cook for the last time in a Test match. It behoves us all to look more closely now.In the past this became almost unnecessary once Cook had established himself at the crease since it was obvious how he would play. There would be the clip off the legs with a grace and power that sometimes surprised, the trusty square cut and the no nonsense pull shot, all of which were ingrained in his method. Less instinctively he would cover-drive, a shot he played well – when in prime form. There were no reverse sweeps. And then there were those gloriously repetitive, wonderfully reassuring defensive shots, lots of them if the bowling was of a high standard since Cook always played the ball not the man.Only the most curmudgeonly of curmudgeons could fail to wish Cook well in his final match. He has served England superbly for a dozen years and imagine how his mere presence and example in the dressing room and at the crease at Chelmsford could enhance the education of young Essex cricketers over the next three summers.Final Test appearances are rarely glorious partly because they often prompt the decision to retire and, in any case, the game seldom permits fairytales. It may help that Cook has already come to his conclusion. When Don Bradman was bowled for a duck below the Oval gasometer in his final innings in 1948, John Arlott suggested that it must be hard to bat with tears in your eyes. This was a generous, sentimental notion but not universally taken to be accurate. England’s first slip on that day, Jack Crapp, once told Frank Keating of this parish: “Tears? That bugger Bradman never had a tear in his eye in all his life.”Cook is more likely to be a little lachrymose. He has already told us that he had to have a couple of beers to stem the tears when announcing his decision to retire to his teammates at Southampton earlier this week. It is doubtful that he will adopt that system before taking guard at the Oval.No doubt Cook will insist that priority one is winning the game, an outcome that would leave England with a healthy 5-2 record in Tests this season, some achievement given the paucity of runs from the upper order. England have picked the same XI that played at Southampton, yet there are significant alterations to how they line up. This time Moeen Ali will appear on the scorecard at No 3 and the name of Jonny Bairstow will have a cross against it, which means that he is the designated wicketkeeper once again. As a consequence Jos Buttler will presumably resume being a specialist No 7, a role that is surely bound to have a limited shelf life.This switch of wicketkeeper feels significant even though there is no guarantee that this will continue throughout the winter – when in stark contrast to this summer batting might be easier higher in the order before the spinners take charge. There remains the unnerving suspicion that Root and Trevor Bayliss have settled on the old status quo in pursuit of a quiet life. Buttler says he is not bothered what role he has in the team Bairstow is adamant that he wants to keep to the extent that there is a concern that his output of runs will diminish if he is denied the gloves.Meanwhile Moeen’s official elevation to No 3, a position that Root has now deserted for good, could also be a pointer to the winter – especially if he scores runs in this match. It so happens that in the eight innings he has in the top three for England Moeen averages 12. Fortunately he is not a superstitious person, and he is ever willing to help out. Currently the India side are more worried by his bowling than his batting. However, Moeen has a wonderful capacity to surprise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1cdaa149948654bc6907a19cf60a02c63a37a3d/0_282_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f505cf135219f8ebd339406712e5bed5","title":"how department store liberty is fashioning success in store and online","story":"Once a favourite of Oscar Wilde, the mock-Tudor-fronted department store has rebooted with fresh designs and modern techConstructed from the timbers of two ships, mock-Tudor-fronted Liberty is one of London’s most recognisable stores.The business was founded by Arthur Lasenby Liberty in 1843 and praised by Oscar Wilde as “the chosen resort of the artistic shopper”. It’s steeped in history. And yet Liberty is also thriving in the 21st century, attracting shoppers from all over the world with its colourful Liberty-print fabrics, designer labels and one-of-a-kind gifts.Listed among Retail Week’s top 10 bricks-and-mortar retailers, it is also a successful retail platform – an always-on business with 500 employees. None of this comes easy. The retail sector is going through challenging times and, despite its wealthy clientele, Liberty must fight to maintain its esteemed position.With all this in mind, the business, with its emphasis on customer service, requires an ultra-reliable digital backbone. But such systems can become obsolete over time. “Two years ago, the company’s network switches were outdated,” says Haaron Weekes, Liberty’s head of IT service delivery and operations, who joined the business in 2016. “Hardware and software support were no longer available, and there were a number of vulnerabilities in its core infrastructure. Having legacy kit also meant we had occasional outages.” This meant staff at Liberty London had to work hard to deliver core aspects of a modern retailer, such as a reliable and secure e-commerce platform and online customer service.“Our legacy firewall was unmanaged and not fit for purpose,” says Weekes. “The infrastructure behind our virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environment was unable to handle the workload, so the performance was poor for anyone who used it.” The VDI – which enables employees to sign in to any desktop computer as if it were their own – serves between 250 and 350 users at the same time. But it was taking some staff more than three-and-a-half minutes to log on to their desktops.To get back up to speed and provide the service Liberty is famed for, Weekes set about overhauling the store’s IT infrastructure, working with multinational technology provider Cisco, as well as his own team that develops, maintains and supports the company’s technology services.Cisco worked with Liberty to understand its objectives: achieving agility and flexibility in its fast-paced industry. “Cisco was, and still is, a network provider, but our technology portfolio has been transformed we now provide the technologies to change the way we work, live, play and learn, in a collaborative secure environment,” says Hema Marshall, its head of small and medium business sales.A team travelled to Liberty’s offices to find out how the company works as a business, and get a clear picture of its existing infrastructure and the problems it was experiencing. From there, Weekes and his team replaced Liberty’s firewall and implemented a flexible IT management tool that’s able to combine and optimise multiple cloud platforms, and can be used to develop and run a range of cloud-based applications.They also rolled out a new Cisco security system that, among other things, only permits certain iniduals to access specific tools and data. The internal network of Liberty was also refreshed and new in-store wifi installed.The wifi system means the Liberty team has gained insights into its customers’ trends via location analytics, says Weekes. Such client information can help to bridge the onlineoffline split and help turn window shoppers into online buyers. But bricks and mortar still count and while Weekes oversaw the backend upgrade, nine front-of-house shopping departments were renovated as part of a 2017 refresh.It’s critical for businesses to be able to quickly scale up and scale out as needed, but digital safeguards are just as critical – especially with new GDPR rules in place. Weekes believes the next-generation firewall has put Liberty in a better position to identify and defend against potential cyberthreats. The company has also increased its disaster recovery capabilities so that it can continue to serve its customers even in the event of any technical issues, says Marshall.Most importantly, the shopping process is now more secure for customers too, and less complicated. “Improved management of what’s happening across the business, with increased visibility and reduced complexity, allows the Liberty teams to focus more on innovation, and not just keeping the lights on,” says Marshall. This newfound ability to innovate and take on emerging challenges stems from several places – the stability of Liberty’s replacement network, the greater time efficiencies enjoyed by staff and, among other things, the benefits of its unified cloud system, which supports HR, antivirus and finance operations.Two years after bringing Cisco on board, Liberty still faces the challenge of keeping up with the everyday security threat, Weekes says. However, its new cybersecurity system does research and work behind the scenes, “so we believe we’re in a better position to face tomorrow’s challenges”, he says.That’ll make his new boss, Adil Mehboob-Khan, Liberty’s chief executive, happy. The former CEO of international eyewear manufacturer Luxottica has more than hinted at his belief in Liberty’s long-term potential. Finally the brand has a digital backbone to match its powerful ambition.Click here to discover how Cisco can help your SME grow"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40b1c4df17c6914f58e8f6716ef2d1617d7fd03c/0_217_3275_1966/master/3275.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6684d97bbdd6ee0b7736aced12ba6cd0","title":"different paths mutual respect susan and jo wokoma on sisterhood","story":"Susan’s an actor and Jo’s a nurse – the Wokoma sisters inhabit very different worlds. But that doesn’t prevent them being each other’s most avid supporter“Jo has this incredibly noble job,” says Susan Wokoma of her little sister, a nurse. “But she’ll say: ‘When we were growing up, we’d watch TV and now you’re in programmes I watch.’ That makes me feel proud of what I’ve done.”Since graduating from drama school in 2010, Susan has rarely been off our screens, notably with parts in supernatural teen drama Crazyhead and cult hit Chewing Gum. She’s also been successful on stage, making her West End debut in 2017 in James Graham’s Labour of Love. It means that although she and Jo still live close to one another in south London, where they grew up, they can sometimes go months without meeting up. “With my job, it’s really difficult,” she says. “I have to drop everything if I get a role and it can be all-consuming. But when we can, we’ll meet for a drink – it’s lovely.”As children, Susan and Jo weren’t nearly as close. Susan was the third child of four and Jo the youngest, so she got away with a lot, Susan says. “My older brother was the only boy, so he could do no wrong, whereas I consider myself the middle child.” Their mother, a cleaner who worked night shifts at MI5, dressed Susan and her elder sister identically, despite their six-year age gap. “When she started to get too old for it, I thought, ‘Cool’ – but then Jo turned up and I had to match with her. Mum dressed us like little Victorian children.”Three-and-a-half years younger, Jo looked up to Susan. “I wanted to follow her everywhere, but on the handful of times she’d take me to her friends’ houses, I’d do something to annoy her – like ask too many questions,” says Jo.“She spoke gobbledygook for a long time, and I couldn’t make out what she was saying – I found her quite sinister,” laughs Susan.For a period, their mother worked at Peckham fire station and would occasionally take the girls to work with her. One of Susan’s favourite memories, she recalls, is of the firefighters letting them play with the hoses, and drenching each other with water.At school, Susan was the good girl, “smart and very together”, recalls Jo, whereas Jo herself was “forever getting into trouble or getting suspended”. During their teenage years, they argued a lot – about makeup, magazines or clothes. Their paths erged even further after a teacher advised Susan to audition for the National Youth Theatre.“After that, I knew my route quite quickly, whereas Jo was quite a difficult kid and it took her a bit longer to find what she wanted to do,” says Susan.Their relationship changed in the coming years. “I’m not especially close to our older sister, so I thought: ‘Be the older sister you would want.’ I started asking Jo how she was, what was going on in her life. I wanted to be the first person she would come to if she was having trouble,” says Susan.Jo had decided to train as a nurse, but halfway through her course, she became pregnant. “I was only 20 and we all knew my dad was going to be really cross, because he wanted me to finish uni,” says Jo.Their Nigerian father worked full-time in the Home Office, as well as having a weekend security job at the Royal Festival Hall. “He had that immigrant mentality of work, work, work,” says Susan, and he wanted his children to do well.“I didn’t tell him until I was over five months pregnant,” says Jo, “and I asked Susan to come with me.”Their father died after Jo’s son was born, and it was Susan’s encouragement that drove Jo to finish her nursing degree. “He always said he wanted me to go back and finish, and I had no intention of doing it, but Susan had just finished filming The Inbetweeners 2 in Australia and she said: ‘If you complete it by the summer, you can come with me to the premiere.’ I graduated and she took me with her, which was really cool.”Now, they message via WhatsApp almost every day, even when Susan is filming, and meet up in person whenever they can. “As I’ve got older I’ve realised she’s super-quick and super-funny,” says Susan. “Actually, she’s overtaken me in some ways – she’s got all these responsibilities, while I’m floating around auditioning or trying to write stuff. I’ve got massive respect for her.”The feeling’s mutual. “Susan’s always been very real and matter-of-fact,” says Jo. “When I was younger I didn’t quite understand – I just thought she was horrible! Now I realise she’s straight with me and that’s what we all lack in our lives. A lot of people tell us what we want to hear, but Susan’s not like that. Any advice she gives is always spot-on, and always in my best interests. She’s a really special person.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba57c7fdb0672625da780d8093f1ae1804fb9d0d/0_75_6464_3879/master/6464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bed6ec2bfa149f7c2aab655af7bb685","title":"10 best street food stalls worldwide readers travel tips","story":"Originally cheap meals for workers, street food offers a true taste of local lives and specialitiesIn the Taiwanese town of Jingtong, I tried what is widely known as “stinky tofu”. At the back of a roadside stall, I sat on a low seat and watched three squares of tofu being cut into four before being plunged into a wok of hot oil. It was served in a bowl with soy sauce and picked sliced cabbage and carrot. It was surprisingly good, not greasy and, although there was a slight smell, it was no worse than a strong blue cheese. With a chilled lime drink, I paid about £2. Helen JI tried socca (chickpea-flour pancakes) for the first time while on holiday in Nice and I will remember it forever. I think I devoured three people’s portions. We were walking through the old town and I noticed queues at various street vendors, but one on a corner had the longest queue. The staff were working in immense heat over enormous flat griddle pans, scraping off the strange-looking substance with a flat utensil like a piece of folded cardboard. I handed over a few euros and it was literally slapped on to a plate and handed to me. With glasses of cold rose from the bar next door, we sat down in the shade to eat our food. I have never been so surprised by, or fallen in love so quickly with a food – and one that’s pretty much impossible to find anywhere at home. KatEvery Friday from spring to late autumn Ljubljana’s Pogačarjev Square fills with food and drink stalls from local producers and restaurateurs, showcasing Slovenia’s best dishes. Tourists and locals perch on the steps outside the cathedral to scoff delights such as potato dumplings with blue cheese sauce, and strawberry cream cake. All waste is recycled at the end of the market and leftover food donated to those in need. odprtakuhna.siOonaghThe best street food sometimes takes you by surprise. We exited the Salina Turda salt mine in Romania into a drizzly, cold car park with empty bellies and - seemingly - without much to eat on offer. We joined the queue at a food van and handed over 2 lei (about 40p), not really knowing what we’d get. It turned out to be a kind of flat deep-fried savoury doughnut covered in salty cream cheese... and it tasted of heaven! A bit of googling revealed that this mystery dish was langosi cu branza. We rejoined the queue.Dean PatrickThere’s a little stall with a little old lady on the corner of Rambutturi alley and Chakrabongse Road in central Bangkok that serves the best slow-cooked pork and rice in the world. It has no name, there’s no menu and she doesn’t speak English. But that’s OK: she only serves one dish and does it spectacularly well. Point at the bubbling pork, hand over 60 baht (about £1,40), take a seat on a little plastic stool and prepare to be blown away. I’ve been visiting this lady every time I go to Bangkok (for more than 20 years), and I love her like my mum! Joanna KangThe pork-rice lady across the street from the Banan Hotel in Battambang, Cambodia, sets up for the breakfast rush every morning. As is typical with this type of establishment, once she runs out of product she closes for the day. The pork was sweet from the marinade and delicately smoky from the charcoal brazier, and at about a dollar it made for a quick, tasty and cheap breakfast.Dave GrahamMomos are steamed dumplings beloved by Nepalese that are typically stuffed with vegetables, chicken or “buff” (buffalo: for Hindus, cows are sacred). These delicacies are served from stalls that spring up by the kerbside from the late afternoon all over Kathmandu. Dished up on small plates made from banana leaves, they come with a dash of spicy sauce. In Kathmandu’s Thamel, the main tourist hub, here are usually a few stalls selling momos for 100 rupees (about a dollar) – they are a bit more expensive, as it is a tourist area, but still represent great value.Marianne HeredgeLa Tilapia is just opposite Villa Las Estrellas on the long beach road in Tulum. You can’t miss the small, but beautifully painted, hut where a charming Mexican lady serves amazing tacos, burritos and ceviche. We stopped here for lunch and enjoyed several of her dishes for a modest price compared to that around. Not only does the food taste amazing it’s served on fantastic colourful plates. A stand out place for sure.LewisA tiny crowded stall at the far end of the tiny town of San Pedro de Atacama drew my attention. My language skills meant pointing awkwardly at a pile of crispy treats and receiving four perfectly filled, crispy steaming parcels of meat and vegetables. I handed over the equivalent of £2 in the hope it would be enough and received £1.75 back in change. With a can of Coke (essential for altitude sickness), I gazed at the lunar landscape and devoured these parcels of joy that Ican never recreate but are always fondly remembered.KatieWherever you are in Uzbekistan it seems you are never too far from a giant kazan, an iron pan where palov, the country’s ubiquitous street food, is cooked over an open fire. The basic ingredients are rice, meat and vegetables. My favourite variety, tuy palov, also contains chickpeas and raisins. Wandering through Tashkent’s central food market, we were invited to share a huge plate of this delicious, Persian-influenced food with a group of friendly workmen who were sitting at a long bench tucking into their lunch: a lovely example of the country’s hospitality.

He wrote: “I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.”Kavanaugh later insisted under questioning that Roe v Wade is “important precedent” and insisted that his concern was about the use of the phrase “all legal scholars” which he viewed as too broad.Even before the story was mentioned inside the hearing room on Thursday, the New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker announced he would leak a confidential document containing Kavanaugh’s thoughts on racial profiling and noted that the potential penalty for doing so could be “ouster from the Senate”. John Cornyn, his Republican counterpart, responded with a dig at Booker, saying that “running for president is no excuse” for leaking information.Dick Durbin, the number two Democrat in the Senate, immediately spoke in solidarity with Booker. “I completely agree with you. I concur with what you’re doing,” he said. “Let’s jump into the pit together. If there is going to be some retribution against the senator from New Jersey, count me in.” After his statement, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii announced she would release confidential documents as well.However, Republicans insisted that the documents in question had already been cleared for publication. In a statement, a spokesman for Senator Chuck Grassley, the chair of the committee, said “restrictions were waived before 4am” and “senators were notified of this before speaking began this morning”. It added that Democrats just wanted to “break the rules and make a scene”.The documents, consisting of emails from Kavanaugh’s time in the Bush White House, were blasted out mid-morning on Thursday. Booker published several emails in which Kavanaugh said that while he favored “race neutral” security measures in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 911, he said there was an “interim question of what to do before a truly effective and comprehensive race-neutral system is developed and implemented”.The fight focused on information turned over from the George W Bush Library about Kavanaugh’s service in the Bush White House. The documents were labeled “committee confidential” which meant that they could not be made public or discussed in public.Bill Burck, a lawyer representing Bush, made the determination for which documents would receive that label. Burck also represents the White House counsel, Don McGahn, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and former White House strategist Steve Bannon in the Mueller investigation.The documents leaked to the New York Times also included Kavanaugh dealing with issues such as warrantless surveillance, affirmative action and a controversial appellate court nomination.Meanwhile, on the floor of the Senate, the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, slammed Kavanaugh for dodging the key questions.“There is no legal, ethical or judicial reason for judge Kavanaugh to avoid directly answering these questions.”He said the judge was evasive, no matter how committee members at the hearing couched their queries.“Can’t talk about specific cases, can’t talk about general situations. He’s ducking, he’s hiding,” Schumer said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b8b587802e7e5acacc345989d0252a2f96a8c09/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a29465daf79c3fe41f9be067e623ab31","title":"country pride kansas rural america sarah smarsh","story":"I was raised on a farm in Kansas, where I’d slopped the hogs and helped harvest the wheat. What did it mean to be ‘country’?What it means to be “country” has changed in the few decades of my lifetime, I think, from an experience to a brand cultivated by conservative forces.Once, when I was about 30, I saw a boy from a small town wearing a T-shirt that read pro-God, pro-guns, pro-life. I was shocked. In my experience, there was no evangelism about my family’s Catholic faith in the 1980s and little overt cross-pollination between our church and our politics. There was, that I can recall, no resentment toward people in cities with more formal education and money. I’m suspicious when I see these tropes trotted out proudly to represent the rural, working-class experience, often by people who have things my family never could have afforded.I’d never heard of Carhartt, for instance, the popular workwear brand sometimes worn as a class-conscious fashion statement, until I was well into adulthood. My choring coveralls were 20 years old with a big corduroy collar and holes in the lining, and I slopped the hogs while wearing old tennis shoes as often as I did in boots.Grandpa’s trucks were small Toyotas bought used, not big Fords or Chevrolets jacked up a foot above big tires to look tough. Those trucks tend to look too clean for a machine that’s done any work. The big flags flying off the back of them would’ve scared our cattle. The people who drive them often live in suburbs and have big, clean garages full of all-terrain vehicles that they call “toys” next to a row of shiny helmets, a very good option I didn’t have as I drove three-wheelers from one pasture to another with buckets of feed.Grandpa would have chuckled at a man with a cattle guard on the front of his truck driving to and from an office job. He would have laughed, too, about designer jeans yellowed with a wash meant to evoke the dirt that was under his fingernails, or the “shabby chic” decorating trend of new furniture meant to look like it had weathered decades in our barn.My family found stuff like that funny rather than offensive, maybe because it was so poorly executed. When affluent urban men in plaid flannel shirts let their hair grow wild and unkempt across their face and necks to affect a laborer’s style for doing laptop work in coffee shops, I think of my dad immaculately trimming his beard every morning before dawn to work on a construction site. The men closest to me took meticulous care with their appearance whenever they had the chance.Mom, too, presented herself like her main job was to be photographed, when it was more likely to sort the inventory in the stockroom of a retail store. Her outfits were ensembles cobbled together from Wichita mall sale racks, but she always managed to look stylish. My favorite was a champagne-colored silk pantsuit that was cut loose and baggy. She wore it with a scarf that had big, lush roses on it like the satiny wallpaper she had glued and smoothed across our hallway. She had married a farm boy but had no interest in plaid shirts.For me, country was not a look, a style, or even a conscious attitude, but a physical place, its experience defined by distance from the forces of culture that would commodify it. That place meant long stretches of near-solitude broken up by long drives on highways to enter society and then exit again.Owning a small bit of the countryside brought my father deep satisfaction. The state had seized some of his dad’s farmland through eminent domain in the 1960s to dig the reservoir and move water east in underground tunnels for the people of Wichita. Sometimes Dad would park his truck on the shoulder of the two-lane blacktop that ran along the lake dam and take my brother and me up the long, steep concrete steps to look at what would have been his and then our small inheritance, now literally underwater. We couldn’t use the water ourselves it was for Wichitans to access by turning on a faucet. We thus had dug a private well right next to a giant reservoir on what once was our land. It’s an old story: pushing poor rural communities out of the way to tap natural resources for cities.Witnessing this as a child had affected Dad deeply, and he shared Grandpa’s attitude toward the value of land: “They don’t make any more of it.” He had plans to buy the bit of land north of the house and build an addition when my brother and I were older and needed more room.Mom was less sure of these plans.Some evenings, I’d watch her curl and tease her dark hair at the vanity mirror that my dad had built next to their master-suite bathroom. She smelled of hair spray and Calvin Klein Obsession perfume. She left in the darkness and turned her car wheels from our dirt road on to the highway for Wichita.When Mom went to a George Strait concert at the small Cowboy Club in Wichita, when Strait was newly famous, Dad sat at the stereo next to our brick fireplace, listening to a radio broadcast of the show on a country station. George would pick a woman from the audience to join him on stage, the man on the radio said. Dad held his breath, worried that Mom would be picked and swept away by a handsome celebrity in tight Wranglers and a cowboy hat. The men I knew more often wore ball caps stained through by the salt of their foreheads.Dad didn’t even like country music. Too sad, he said.In college, I began to understand the depth of the rift that is economic inequality. Roughly speaking, on one side of the rift was the place I was from – laborers, workers, people filled with distrust for the systems that had been ignoring and even spurning them for a couple decades. On the other side were the people who run those systems – basically, people with college funds who end up living in cities or moving to one of the expensive coasts. It’s much messier than that, of course. But before arriving on campus, I hadn’t understood the extent of my family’s poverty – “wealth” previously having been represented to me by a friend whose dad was our small town’s postmaster and whose mom went to the Wichita mall every weekend.Even at a midwestern state university, my background – agricultural work, manual labor, rural poverty, teen pregnancies, domestic chaos, pervasive addiction – seemed like a faraway story to the people I met. Most of them were from tidy neighborhoods in Wichita, Kansas City, the greater Chicago area. They used a different sort of English and had different politics. They were appalled that I had grown up with conservative ideas about government and Catholic doctrine against abortion. I was appalled that they didn’t know where their food came from or even seem to care since it had always just appeared on their plates when they wanted it.There was no language for whatever I represented on campus. Scholarships and student organizations existed to boost kids from disadvantaged groups such as racial minorities, international students and the LGBTQ community. I was none of those things, and professors and other students often assumed from looking at me or hearing me speak that I was a middle-class kid with parents sending me money.To pay my room and board during my freshman year at college, I worked as a tutor for poor middle-school kids in nearby Kansas City and Topeka in the afternoons, as a stage technician for a performing arts center in the evenings, and as my dorm’s front-desk attendant overnight. During spring break, I was the trail boss for an environmental cleanup crew. I waited tables, too, late-night shifts worth a 45-minute drive to Kansas City because the tips were better there. I knew other kids with jobs but not many who had no choice but to work.There are many complicated reasons why so few people cross a socio-economic ide in any lasting way, but one of the reasons is simple: it is a painful crossing. Those were the hardest years of my life.When I called home, I heard the familiar stories: my 30-year-old cousin didn’t know how she’d pay her hospital bills, but she’d survived colon cancer. At a party Grandma threw at the farm, Grandpa’s daughter-in-law rifled through unlocked parked cars to steal cash – to buy drugs, my mom speculated – and in the process took my cousin’s last $20. Well, she’d had it, so she beat the shit out of her while my mom cheered her on and my uncle tried to pull them apart. Dad was on a new job site. His wife was having more health problems, due to painkillers that an unscrupulous physician had carelessly prescribed. Bills bills bills.Then I hung up and went to class.Few people knew how much I was struggling both emotionally and financially, because I didn’t talk to anyone about it or even understand how bad off I was. Knowing I’d never ask for it, my high school cheerleading coach mailed me $300. I put it in a thank-you card and mailed it back.Like the conservative laborer who spurns the idea of “handouts”, my pride was bigger than my need. I didn’t know the term “first-generation student” and didn’t grasp yet that I had in fact “grown up poor” and was still very much “living in poverty”. The best I could come up with for describing my situation was that I was a “financially independent student” and that “I grew up on a farm”.I once took a roommate, a funny, sharp girl raised in lower-middle-class Wichita, to the farm and was stunned to see it through her eyes. Everything was worth exclaiming about – the cows, the pigs, the chickens, the butchering shed, the cow tongue pickling in a jar in the refrigerator, the way every single adult was drinking alcohol. My friend’s mouth fell open when my uncle boomed through the front door, carrying a plate of flayed raccoon meat to put on the stove.Eating raccoon was remarkable even for us. The occasional turtle or rabbit ended up in the kitchen as novelty, maybe, but raccoon seemed plumb trashy. I was embarrassed when my friend told the story again and again back on campus – a situation I found I could control by telling the stories myself.“Cows are more pleasant than goats,” I’d say to explain why we had one and not the other, and my college friends would crack up like it was an amazing joke. Grandpa had bought a few goats when I was little, and they had turned out to be a menace.“Why did he buy the goats?” they would ask, as though the answer were complicated and perhaps had something to do with personal fulfillment.“Because they are cheap and eat weeds,” I’d say, and they’d bend over laughing. By then I’d be laughing, too, because I was amazed it was so funny to anyone.In those moments I saw that mine wasn’t as much a sad story as it was a rare one, that better-off people’s fascination was not just derision but, sometimes, honest awe. The distance between my world and my country’s understanding of it had been growing because so few people from my place ever ended up on a college campus to tell its stories. It was a distance I wanted to make smaller.About a year after Grandpa died, during the autumn of my junior year in college, I was editing a story in the campus paper’s newsroom on the night of the 2000 presidential election. The whole staff was on duty, watching election returns on a boxy television mounted to a wall above a Rosie the Riveter poster and a fax machine that press releases came across. Earlier in the day I had cast my first-ever ballot in a national election, for George W Bush.A friend and fellow editor with reddish-brown dreadlocks, a head scarf, and plugs in her earlobes sat down next to me at my computer, looked into my eyes, and asked, “How could you vote for him?”Something had changed my people politically in the 20 years since my then teenage mom had voted for Jimmy Carter when I was an infant, the year Reagan won. There I was to prove it – a liberally minded young person from the rural working class who had somehow voted Republican.Whatever caused the change, it crystallized with the popularity of a new conservative cable TV network. We didn’t have cable at the farm, but in Wichita Mom had started listening to conservative talk radio. She’d nod along in the car as a host spewed venomous attacks on liberalism. Something in his apparent outrage about “government handouts” appealed to her. She was open-minded and progressive on most social issues but raised a defiant middle finger to the idea of so-called assistance, so I did, too. I voted for Kansas native Bob Dole in my rural high school’s 1996 mock presidential election. Mom and I cheered when the GOP retained a majority in both houses that year.One of my aunts was the only person in our family who I recall refusing to budge from older affiliations between class and party. “The Democrats are for poor people, and the Republicans are for the rich,” she would declare and slam her beer on the table.“No,” Mom would reply. “Democrats help people, and Republicans help people help themselves.”People on welfare were presumed “lazy”, and for us there was no more hurtful word. Within that framework, financially comfortable liberals may rest assured that their fortunes result from personal merit while generously insisting they be taxed to help the “needy”. Impoverished people, then, must do one of two things: concede personal failure and vote for the party more inclined to assist them, or vote for the other party, whose rhetoric conveys hope that the labor of their lives is what will compensate them. It’s a hell of a choice, and initially I made mine based on my mother’s ideas at the time. My liberal peers were no different in that respect, for the most part having shown up on campus with their parents’ beliefs.A sociology course the spring of my junior year dismantled my political views about fiscal policy. Study after study that I found in my research for the class plainly said in hard numbers that, if you are poor, you are likely to stay poor, no matter how hard you work. As I examined the graphs over and over, my heart sped up with shock and anger. On the matter of my own country’s economic system, for all my family wisdom about what something ought to cost and who was peddling a con, I had been sold a bill of goods.The people I’d grown up with were missing that information. But the liberal people I met in college often were missing another sort of information: what it feels like to pee in a cup to qualify for public benefits to feed your children. A teenager’s frustration when a dilapidated textbook is missing a page and there’s no computer in the house for finding the lesson online. The impossibility of paying a citation for expired auto insurance, itself impossible to pay despite 50 hours a week holding metal frying baskets at KFC.It wasn’t that I’d been wrong to be suspicious of government programs, I realized, but that I’d been wrong to believe in the American Dream. They were two sides of the same trick coin – one promising a good life in exchange for your labor and the other keeping you just alive enough to go on laboring.My mother and other family members would soon make similar shifts just by following the news and seeing cracks in the political messages they had received. Without need for a college class, many abandoned their short-lived conservatism for progressive views.As college experiences took me outside my home state, I realized that Kansas as a whole suffered from a disconnect with power that was similar to what I experienced on the farm. The broader country viewed states like mine as unimportant, liminal places. They yawned while driving through them, slept as they flew over them.If you’re cast as a stereotype enough times – as a poor person, as a female, as the native of a place most people have never been – you might feel who you truly are fortify in opposition to it. Where the shame I sometimes felt as a child in poverty had once been, as a young woman in a new setting I felt a quiet pride about that place thought forgettable or populated by trash.We were the “breadbasket” I’d helped harvest the wheat that fed the world. Wichita was the “air capital” my grandmothers had assembled warplanes there in the same factories where my aunts and uncles now worked. We were in “tornado alley” we had ridden out storms in trailers and farmhouse basements and lived to describe the softball-size hail and the hay straw driven by the wind into a tree trunk.Whether or not I got a college degree, those experiences would always be my first education."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a02963c081e0b8af4abefb59215ca80d0dfe1f9f/170_492_3396_2038/master/3396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8298326df27ea3119280f6cbe02b62e0","title":"alexander litvinenko alex goldfarb sues russian tv channels for libels","story":"Alex Goldfarb has filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan after broadcasts on RT and Channel One blamed him for the former Russian spy’s 2006 death in LondonA close friend of Alexander Litvinenko sued two Russian state television channels on Thursday for airing false claims that he was behind the late dissident’s murder.Alex Goldfarb said he was the victim of “malicious defamation” in broadcasts shown on RT and Channel One earlier this year that blamed him for the fatal 2006 poisoning of Litvinenko in London.In a complaint filed to federal court in Manhattan, Goldfarb accused both channels of libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress. He requested unspecified damages.The legal action was supported by Litvinenko’s widow, Marina, who previously added her name to demands for retractions from the state-controlled television stations for their broadcasts.“It took me 10 years to get some closure when a British court named my husband’s murderers,” Marina Litvinenko said in a statement. “Now these false claims that he was killed by our close friend are broadcast to tens of millions of people. This adds insult to injury.”Anna Belkina, a spokeswoman for RT, said: “We have received a letter from Mr Goldfarb’s representative, and we are in the process of reviewing it.” Representatives for Channel One did not respond to a request for comment.Litvinenko, a former Russian intelligence officer, was murdered in 2006 with a radioactive cup of tea. A public inquiry held by British authorities a decade later ruled that his killers were Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun and that they were sent by Russia’s FSB spy agency – probably with the approval of President Vladimir Putin.The Kremlin has mounted a campaign to discredit the official version of the killing with help from Litvinenko’s father, Walter, who once blamed Putin for his son’s death but changed his account after returning to Russia from an unhappy exile in 2012.Goldfarb’s lawsuit cites three broadcasts on Channel One and two on RT in March and April, following the nerve agent attack on another Russian dissident in England, which the British government has since blamed on Russian military intelligence.It highlights comments made by Walter Litvinenko on Channel One on 20 March, when the elder Litvinenko claimed Goldfarb was a CIA agent and that he had been told “Alex killed Alexander,” later adding: “Goldfarb. It was his work.”Goldfarb, who also pointed to another Channel One show that repeated the false allegations 10 days later, said in his lawsuit that the channel acted maliciously by choosing to ignore the official judicial findings on Litvinenko’s killing.One of the RT broadcasts, which aired on 1 April, featured similar remarks from Walter Litvinenko and falsely asserted that all materials from the British inquiry into the poisoning death had been classified and kept secret.“I don’t know if I will ever collect any damages,” Goldfarb said in a statement. “But I saw my friend die a most horrible death. I cannot permit them lie about it with impunity. I must show them, myself and everyone else that their spell of evil can somehow, somewhere be checked. Many people support us.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3620789.1536248493!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"antlers of extinct giant irish elk found at the bottom of a lake","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRaymond McElroy pictured with the antlers and skull of a Great Irish Elk, taken up today by a net in Lough Neagh. Photograph: Ardboe Gallery, FacebookFishermen Raymond McElroy and Charlie Coyle thought their nets had snagged on an old piece of dead tree at the bottom of Lough Neagh. It had been a bad night’s fishing and when they ventured out to their nets on the lake at 4.30am, they found they had caught no fish, yet the net was straining. It took two of them all their strength to lift the net from the lough floor. By the weight, they figured it might be a piece of a dead tree snagged at the bottom. Instead, it was the perfectly preserved antlers of a giant Irish elk. Now extinct, this magnificent animal stood more than two metres tall and had antlers of up to four metres in diameter. Though called the Irish elk because their skeletons have been found in the bogs of Ireland, they roamed across most of northern Europe, but died out 7,000 years ago in mysterious circumstances. One of the largest collections of such deer is in the National History Museum in Dublin. Mr Coyle said he got a fright when the two metre wide antlers came out of the water. “I thought it was the devil himself. I was going to throw it back in. I didn’t know what to do with it.” Mr McElroy said he recognised straight away that it was the antlers of a giant Irish elk. The jawbone of possibly the same animal was recovered from the lake in 2014. The antlers are now in his garage awaiting a new home. He is seeking interested parties from what had been a fishing trip that will live long in the memory."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3620506.1536234310!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"full text six eu ambassadors give their thoughts on the state of ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit: ’the single greatest economic and foreign-policy challenge to the Irish state since the Second World War’The following is the text of a diplomatic note about the state of Ireland from six EU ambassadors to Dublin. It was drafted ahead of the papal visit and circulated to their capitals and diplomatic contacts.In 1979, Pope John Paul II visited Ireland. This month, August 2018, Pope Francis will visit Ireland. The visit of Pope John Paul II was the first trip ever to Ireland by any Pope. To stipulate its significance: from Saturday 29 September to Monday 1 October 1979 an estimated 2.7 million people attended events across the country. This was over half of the Irish population. Nearly forty years later, Pope Francis is to visit a completely changed Irish society. Over the four decades the Emerald Isle has seen unprecedented societal, demographic, economic, political, and cultural change. Therefore, Pope Francis’s visit gives us an opportunity to look back and try to understand how this process formed the open, dynamic, cosmopolitan Ireland we know today. This paper is a result of cooperation between the six Ambassadors to Ireland – from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands – after a series of interviews with stakeholders within the Irish society. Ireland at the heart of Europe 1979 was not only the year of the Papal-visit, it was also important in the development for Irish independence after the establishment of Saorstát Éireann (the Irish Free State) in 1922. Although Ireland already joint the European Community back in 1973, in the year 1979, Ireland officially broke the one-for-one link between the Irish pound and the pound sterling. The final decision to align with the European Monetary System was based on a strategic vision that Ireland’s economic and political future lay with a broader Europe rather than solely with the UK. By 30 March 1979, an exchange rate was introduced. A shift from a pure focus on the UK for political and economic relations to a broader focus on the whole of the EU was vital for the exceptional economic growth in Ireland. Because of Irish membership to the EU, a clear change is visible regarding the Irish attitude towards external actors and in particular the UK. The imbalance between Ireland and the UK slowly vanished by both countries being full members of the club. Until 1973, no UK Prime-Minister ever visited the Irish Republic and the Taoiseach in office always had to travel to London. Now, with a growing agenda between the two countries on all EU matters, instead of just Anglo-Irish relations to discuss, the relation between the two countries changed. This slow process over the years eventually led to the watershed moment of the visit of Queen Elizabeth in 2011. “For us, Europe enabled our transformation from being a country on the periphery, to an island at the center of the world, at the heart of the common European home that we helped to build.” A more liberal society: Rethinking the role of Irish Catholicism The first difference which comes to mind with Pope Francis’s visit is of religious nature. The relationship between the Church, the State, and society has completely changed. State and Church in Ireland have always been strongly intertwined, since the Irish Free State and the 1937 Constitution. As can be seen in the scandals that came to light over the last years, the Church is complicit, but so is the State. The Church has been discredited by the yearlong drumbeat of abuse allegations that began to emerge in the early 1990s as well as a cover-up by church officials denying the problem and moving abusive priests from parish to parish. For decades, Irish priests zealously protected their communities from what they saw as the moral dangers posed by sexual promiscuity, unwed mothers and impoverished children, sometimes orphaned or neglected. They used an unwritten, extralegal power — often at the urging of scandalized family or neighbours — to send such women and children to Dickensian facilities like industrial schools, Magdalene Laundries (workhouses run by Catholic orders) and homes for the pregnant and unwed.As Fintan O’Toole, a highly acclaimed columnist for The  states: This system of control and care by State and Church has lost its grip on society. In 1979, Catholic social teaching held sway in the Republic with contraception, orce, and abortion all banned by law. Not so now. That Ireland is no more. The Irish people have directly chosen their course. Over the years, they voted for these shifts: referendums on orce (1995), same-sex marriage (2015 as the first in Europe), and abortion (2018) testified of fundamental changes of the role of the Church in Irish society. Because rising prosperity within the country, scandals within the Church and church policies in contrast to the more liberal attitudes of the Irish, people are less guided by their faith. Although 23rd of the Irish people still identity as Catholic, this made the distance between the Church and the institutions and the Irish citizens bigger. They’ve started to think for themselves and had other options than dependence on faith. In a much broader sense, the grip of the Catholic Church on Irish society has been and is still loosening. As Fintan O’Toole states: “It is a momentous change: a nexus of power and authority that lasted for 150 years is finished.” With cities mainly having driven the change, today’s Ireland is liberal, welcoming, vibrant, outward-looking, economically successful. And for many, Ireland does not qualify purely as a “catholic country” any more.During the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1979 the Troubles were at its height. John Paul II was prevented from going north because of the dire security situation, of which he stated that this grieved him greatly. The critical situation in Northern-Ireland had direct consequences for Ireland. As well, as former Taoiseach FitzGerald – who was in office during the 1980s writes:“All Irish Governments recognized that in some respect the IRA campaign of violence represented more of a threat to the Irish State than to Britain. The Dublin riots of 1972 and 1981 offered warning signs of what could happen if the violence in Northern Ireland were to overflow to the Republic, with its unarmed police force and its small army.”The 1998 Good Friday Agreement, achieved with the support of the US but also the EU has proven to be instrumental to stabilize the situation on the island, to facilitate reconciliation, cooperation and extensive trade across borders. It still is a volatile peace, though, and fears of a re-emergence of conflict due to Brexit are palpable in almost all conversations in Ireland. With Brexit, old ghosts from the past come back to haunt the Irish Island and questions that no longer deemed relevant have come back to the forefront again. This is illustrated in particular by the border question. As the Irish government officially states: “As the most obvious symbol of the Peace Process, the invisible border on the island of Ireland is essential to the continuing normalisation of relationships. Prior to the Good Friday Agreement, security checkpoints on the border, and accompanying military installations, which had been built and reinforced from the 1970s onwards, were potent symbols of ision and conflict in Northern Ireland and were frequent targets for attack. The disappearance of physical border crossings and checkpoints is both a symbol of and a idend from the success of the Peace Process. People’s daily lives in Northern Ireland and in the border region have been transformed. Any reversal of this transformation would have considerable adverse economic, social, political, security and psychological impacts on people both in border communities and on the island as a whole.”The future of Northern-Ireland and its relation with Ireland strongly depends on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the EU. With the ongoing negotiations, people are less inclined to say that a united Ireland will not happen in their lifetime. A bad deal for Northern-Ireland can speed up the process towards a possibly united Ireland. With a bad deal the North can lose both of its most important revenue streams, the all-Island economy and UK as well as EU subsidies. Plus, by 2021 demographics indicate a decisive change: the majority in NI will then be of catholic faith. This could trigger people to re-think and change their opinion on the possibility of a united Ireland. Crucial questions would have to be answered: How to accommodate those who feel British? How to incorporate the many differences (as a most recent example: different abortion laws). And: any reunification would be financially extremely costly for the Irish state. Sensible, transparent and accountable decisions are vital for Northern-Ireland and the country as a whole, because of the delicate balance regarding the Northern-Irish peace project.The period between papal-visits to Ireland is also one of spectacular economic growth. From the “poorhouse of Europe” to the Celtic tiger to the Economic Crash to the Celtic Phoenix, it has been a bumpy ride. Where GDP per capita was 15,000 EUR in 1980, it reached a whopping 64.860 EUR in 2018 according to the statistics of the World Economic Outlook of the International Monetary Fund.The Republic of Ireland was the first country of the EU to officially enter recession when the 2008 financial crisis began, but rose again to become the fastest growing economy in the euro zone. A title it has now held since since 2014. Where the country suffered from a property bubble, housing prices and rents have reached or even surpassed pre-crisis levels and Ireland is back roaring again. As Columnist Brian Boyd wrote in the : “Cocaine usage in the country is now back to Celtic Tiger-era levels, a time when it was commonplace in Dublin nightspots to see one of our wretched ‘media personalities’ furiously rubbing their nose into it”.Rising from the ashes of the crippled Celtic Tiger era, The Economist has dubbed the current growth in the Irish economy the ‘Celtic Phoenix.’ Ireland’s post-crisis economic recovery was driven by foreign direct investment from US-companies in pharmaceuticals and Silicon Valley and from the positive effects of the IMFECB-programmes. While this growth model was made possible by Ireland’s low corporate tax rates, it was also a result of inward migration, with these firms using Ireland to directly access the European labour market. The question for the near future is whether this growth is sustainable Ireland the Celtic Phoenix or merely a case of Leprechaun Economics?Finally, demographics are important to take into account to fully understand Ireland. Hunger, oppression of the Irish, their faith and culture, landgrabbing by the UK, poverty, the Great Famine and the extensive streams of emigration over the years played an important part in shaping the country. In the area covering the present day Republic of Ireland, the population was about 6.5 million in the mid-1840s. Ten years later, it was down to 5 million. The population continued a slow decline well into the 20th century, with the Republic recording a low of 2.8 million people in a 1961 census. No other nation state in the world besides Ireland has a current population smaller than its population in the mid-19th century. This is very closely linked to the Irish story of migration, where most Irish who emigrated were economic migrants. Their experiences were initially very bad. They were regarded as ‘the scum of the scum’ abroad: being both poor and Catholic. Therefore, the story of Irish emigration has many similarities to the story of the people who stayed in the country where they overcame this adversity and prospered in new countries. The election of John F Kennedy – who was of Irish descent –was and is a very proud moment for the Irish. Many in Ireland used to have two pictures standing on the mantelpiece: one of the pope and one of JFK.What kept Irish communities so closely together and stimulated them to have a strong sense of Irishness can partially be seen in the gloomy situation of migrants who stuck together in hostile environments. However, it is also explained by reasons that are more positive. The strong ties in sports, culture, music, and storytelling still binds Irish all over the world. The Gaelic games, Irish pubs and literature are strong beacons for Irish emigrants to hold on to in order to keep their feeling of Irishness and their connection to the island. The Irish diaspora have helped to shapeIrish society by their strong connection to their home country. Although a part of the diaspora tend to be more traditional than the people in Ireland itself, there is also a large group that developed new values and many of the emigrants have been important agents for the values of the current society a cosmopolitan, liberal, inclusive county. What’s next for Ireland? The country has many important decisions to make in the near future that will shape the society for the decades to come. To name a few: deciding on the next step of Europeanisation and a changing relationship with the UK because of Brexit, becoming less dependent of foreign direct investment and large multinationals from the United States, reforming its health-system to bring it on par with Western European standards, re-energising the improvement of education as well as structural changes to the role of the church in education, dealing with the current ‘rich-man’s problems’ of overly expensive residential space — which has been called a true housing crisis — and invest in the infrastructure needed to accommodate economic and population growth. Ireland has too long aimed its growth strategy on being a transatlantic hub for EU market access. Ireland’s reliance on a small number of major multinationals leaves the economy vulnerable and threatens the outlook of growth. Nowadays, five companies in the tech and pharma sectors account for one-third of all Irish exports. As Peter Clinch, chairman of the National Competitve Council put it in relation to Brexit: “Ireland is relying on one big engine as we fly into much stormier skies” As capital investment was virtually non-existent during the crisis-years there is now a lack of good infrastructure, adequate healthcare, (social) housing, and Ireland needs to step up efforts in education. In relation to this, Ireland has to prepare its (social) infrastructure for the expected strong population growth. Because of that Ireland — for the first time in history — has to critically assess its migration policy and whom it wants to let into the county. The current drop in University ratings is a direct consequence of the downfall in government spending. The government has to make a choice in order to increase education funding: either it should be made possible for universities to increase education fees or government funding needs to be increased. This will be a political challenge. In response, the Irish government recently introduced Project Ireland 2040, focussing on the development of the country in the light of an expected population growth of 1 million. Focus is also laid on de-centralization (from Dublin) and support for the regions including infrastructure projects, broadband schemes and others. The objective of Project Ireland 2040 is not only economic but recognises that economic and social progress go hand in hand and aims to provide a comprehensive social, economic and cultural infrastructure for all our people to flourish, so that together the Irish can create a better society.Finally, the elephant in the room: Brexit. The decision of the UK to leave the EU causes strong economical, civic, political, and civic challenges for Ireland. Brexit represents the single greatest economic and foreign-policy challenge to the Irish state since the Second World War. There is hardly any area of Irish life that won’t be affected.From an economic perspective, Ireland has over the last forty years enhanced its European and global trade extensively, but needs to ersify its exports to other external markets even more, because of the high dependency of exports to the UK. Political challenges lie ahead regarding Ireland’s place in the EU. Nevertheless, mainly from a civic point of view, the Irish border question needs to be answered in order to ensure the stability on the Irish island.With all these domestic challenges in this volatile foreign environment, it is positive to see the current engagement of the Irish Government and their recently published investment plan Ireland 2040 and Ireland’s vision on expanding its diplomatic network \u0026amp ‘footprint’ in years to come.Authors Ambassador of the Kingdom of Belgium in Ireland H.E.

Photograph: Ciara WilkinsonAnthony MurphyThe National Monuments Service (NMS) received 66 reports of newly identified monuments during the months of July and August 2018, it has confirmed.Many of the new reports relate “to features identified through crop-marks or scorch-marks which had become visible on account of the dry weather,” a spokesperson confirmed.Among them was a previously unknown henge (a circle of stone uprights) near Newgrange in the Brú na Boinne Unesco World Heritage Site in Co Meath, found by Anthony Murphy using his drone. The discovery made international news headlines.Among the other sites reported over the summer are a prehistoric barrow cemetery found in Redcow near Dundalk, Co Louth by Matthew Kelly who was trying to locate a site once described as Ireland’s Stonehenge.Mr Kelly also took drone footage of two ringfort enclosures in the nearby Glebe and Lisdoo townlands and the NMS estimates the range of monuments recorded across all sites date from 2200 BC to 1000 AD.The NMS said that the two ringfort enclosures “were not previously known” to it, although they were visible on aerial footage taken in 1995.The sites reported by Mr Kelly in the Redcow townland were not previously known either and the NMS said, “these features probably represent a prehistoric barrow cemetery comprising up eight inidual monuments with two of the eight features being classed as enclosures which might either represent features contemporary with the barrow cemetery or later settlement activity.”It estimates that the barrows date from 2200 to 1900 BC while “the two newly identified ringforts referred to NMS by Mr Kelly in Glebe and Lisdoo are likely to date to the period 500-1000AD.”Mr Kelly, who is from Lahinch in Co Clare and chief technology officer with software company DroneSAR said, “I was inspired by Anthony Murphy’s find by drone at Newgrange due to the very dry weather, and so the very next day I went to Dundalk to see if I could also find any sign of a long lost monument discovered by antiquarian Thomas Wright in 1748 which he described as Ireland’s Stonehenge.”“But by 1907 historian Henry Morris could not find any remains of the monument, it had disappeared. I (also) read about this monument in Anthony’s mythical Ireland blog a few years ago.“I arrived at what I thought was the location of the Stonehenge monument outside Dundalk with my drone to look for any markings in the ground that might indicate the presence of this monument but I could not see anything. Before I landed the drone I decided I would do a 360 pan across the horizon and it was during this that I saw the circles in two different fields in the distance.”“I found two large circular enclosures facing each other separated by a road and then at the other location where I thought there was just one circular enclosure there was actually eight in the same field. I remember the moment as the drone took off over the field and the many circles became visible. Between the two locations I found 10 previously unknown monuments.”The NMS also said “reports are still being received, so this (66) should not be taken as a final figure for monuments newly reported in 2018.”Meanwhile, Mr Murphy has confirmed that the henge he discovered, with Ken Williams, near Newgrange, will feature on Channel 4’s Hidden Britain by Drone which is presented by Sir Tony Robinson.Mr Murphy travelled to London for the interview. He said, “the programme producers felt they couldn’t leave out what was (in their words) the biggest archaeological discovery of the summer,” from the programme.It is being broadcast at 7pm this Sunday, September 9th."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3621007.1536259861!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"consequences of no deal brexit go beyond what we can imagine","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPolish MEP Danuta Hubner chairs a European Parliament committee that must sign off on any Brexit treaty. Photograph: Carl GibneyDCUThere was an “openness” within the European Union to consider other ways of avoiding a hard border in Ireland to help secure a Brexit deal, an influential European MEP has said.Polish MEP Danuta Hubner, who chairs a European Parliament committee that must sign off on any Brexit treaty, said there had to be “openness” from the UK too to find an alternative solution to the issue. EU and UK negotiators are locked in a political stalemate over agreement on the so-called backstop that would guarantee an open border in Ireland in the event of no deal on future EU-UK trade. “If UK has a better proposal for the backstop, we are open to discuss these things. In a sense, there is openness. It just all depends on whether there is also an openness on the UK side,” she said.The British were offering no solution to maintain an open border in Ireland while London was still sticking with its “red lines” of leaving the EU single market and customs union, she said.Ms Hubner, on a visit to Ireland to speak at Dublin City University’s Brexit Institute, warned of the possibility of the UK crashing out of the EU without a withdrawal treaty being agreed.“We don’t have other options,” she said. “The consequences of no deal, I think, go beyond what we can imagine but we have to be prepared . . . it is a possibility or a likelihood.” The Polish politician told the institute in her presentation that people were “extremely pessimistic” in Europe abut the Brexit negotiations, putting the chances of a deal between the EU and UK at 50:50.She suggested that the UK should seek a Norway-type deal to join the European Economic Area and remain in the single market as Europe could not afford another “very specific, bespoke solution”.“If the Brits were smart, then they should join the EEA and then look for changes later on,” she said.The chair of the European Parliament’s constitutional affairs committee said that Brexit negotiations could slip past a key EU summit in October but November was the final deadline for a deal if EU lawmakers were to ratify it in time for the UK’s departure from the union in March.“It might slip to November and we can still do it on time if we have it in November. Any further delay would really bring a threat of no deal,” she told The  before her address to the institute.Ms Hubner said that the deep isions British prime minister Theresa May was struggling with in her own party on Brexit were “certainly not helpful”.“Whatever she is proposing, she sees two unhappy halves of her government because for some it is not enough for others, it is too much,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Tokyo came third and Los Angeles fourth.Countrywide, France finished two places above the UK, in sixth position, with Britain the only country in the global top 10 to lose ground in the rankings - in eighth. The US was first.Germany was by far Europe’s top country for the uber-rich but Berlin failed to hit the top ten city rankings “owing to the fact that (Germany’s) significant levels of wealth are far more evenly dispersed across its major cities,” said the report.French president Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s tax breaks for the wealthy appear to be working, the report suggestsDubbed by critics “the president of the rich”, Mr Macron has introduced a raft of tax reforms in a bid to dispel France’s reputation as a country that soaks the rich and stifles enterprise.Last year, he scrapped its contentious wealth tax on everything except property assets - in effect cutting the tax by 70 per cent. The number of people paying it has dropped from 360,000 to 120,000 this year.In January, he introduced a 30 per cent flat tax rate on capital gains, idends and interests - a longstanding demand from investors and entrepreneurs - and removed the top marginal band of payroll tax.“He has effectively halved the tax paid by the very wealthy,” said Etienne Lefevbre, editor of financial daily Les Echos, who said Paris had been “doing a belly dance to attract wealthy Londoners to Paris” ahead of Brexit, including opening international lycées for their children.Another key sweetener, said, Jérôme Barre, tax partner at Franklin, was a specific regime for “impatriates” who are not taxed on real estate abroad for five years and are waived former pension contributions and other charges.France’s 45 per cent inheritance tax was still a disincentive, he said.Emmanuel Macron is facing record low popularity at home but his pro-business reforms have increased France\u0026#39s international allureCorinne Dadi, a tax lawyer with  Stehlin, said the findings tallied with what she had seen in recent months.“There is renewed interest in Paris. In the past, I did a lot of tax expatriation out of France but since Macron’s arrival, for the first time in 15 years, I am organising returns here,” she said.Ms Dadi said that almost those wishing to leave London cited “Brexit plus a huge fear of Jeremy Corbyn”.Another reason was Britain’s decision to slash “non-dom” tax perks offered to people whose permanent home or “domicile” is outside the UK, which imposed new limits on their ability to keep offshore income out of Britain’s tax net.The number of ultra-rich worldwide rose 13 percent last year, according to Wealth-X, totaling about 256,000 people with combined assets of $31.5 trillion. Women accounted for about 35,000 of the ultra-rich last year, a record-high share of nearly 14 percent, the study found.Donald Trump administration seeks to detain illegal immigrant families indefinitelyTransgender person accused of rape is remanded into female prison and sexually assaults inmates within daysScientists find evidence of 7,000 year old cheese in Neolithic villages in Croatia Donald Trump\u0026#39s top lieutenants forced to deny they wrote explosive insider accountComment: John McDonnell is trying to change his image.

She returned to port the next day.Nick Childs of the International Institute for Strategic Studies says it was a fairly minor incident and part of the nature of maritime operations, especially when compared to the military probing immediately after the Falklands War.However, he said the maritime domain is increasingly contested globally and this incident shows how the Navy is increasingly being  pulled in all sorts of directions at the same time with limited resources.Former captain of frigate HMS St Albans, Commander Tom Sharpe, suggested the Argentinian ship had been snooping for oil reserves. He thought the response from HMS Clyde had been timely, proportional and appropriate, and therefore had the desired effect.Not intercepting for fear of being seen to overreact or, worse still, because of insufficient resources - using \u0027not wishing to over-react\u0027 as an excuse - is unacceptable and a road we have trodden before in this part of the world, he said.This type of operation is precisely what navies should do. Do we need a frigate or destroyer in the South Atlantic all the time? Not necessarily. This in no way should take anything from the excellent HMS Clyde, operating alone and unafraid around the clock in some of the most hostile waters on the planet.Ministry of DefencePlease review our commenting policyParis overtakes London in the super-rich league as the \u0026#39Macron effect\u0026#39 lures the wealthy to City of LightDonald Trump administration seeks to detain illegal immigrant families indefinitelyTransgender person accused of rape is remanded into female prison and sexually assaults inmates within daysScientists find evidence of 7,000 year old cheese in Neolithic villages in Croatia Donald Trump\u0026#39s top lieutenants forced to deny they wrote explosive insider accountComment: John McDonnell is trying to change his image.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

One believes that the Labour leader’s radicalism in this area is a political weakness or a distraction that should be set aside to ensure focus on domestic policy, the party’s strength. The other side takes the view that not only are there important principles at stake, but that in fact Corbyn has some compelling iding lines to draw here with his opponents and predecessors.\u0026nbspSo long as Corbyn remains leader, it is the latter camp that is likely to win out. The prominence of foreign policy is simply an unavoidable fact of life for any British government or opposition, irrespective of any desire to focus on the domestic. The UK is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a nuclear power, one of a tiny minority of states capable of projecting military power on an intercontinental basis, and one of the largest economies in the world.\u0026nbspCorbyn’s stances in this area will continue to be shaped by his longstanding worldview, and the fact that the recent furore over his participation in a Palestinian wreath laying ceremony in 2014 has had no discernible effect on Labour in the polls means that there is little incentive for him to change course.\u0026nbspIt may be, however, that the underlying premise of this disagreement at the top of the party is a faulty one. Because when we look seriously at the actual substance of Labour’s foreign policy, what we find is not particularly radical. Corbyn’s personal philosophy on international affairs may be sharply different from that of the political class, but the concrete set of policies Labour espouses under his leadership are (to make a strictly analytical rather than a value judgement), mildly reformist, not revolutionary.\u0026nbspLabour’s current policy position is set out in four key texts: Corbyn’s speech to the foreign policy think tank Chatham House in May 2017, his brief speech in response to the Manchester Arena bombing that same month, a speech to the United Nations in Geneva in December 2017, and the party’s 2017 election manifesto. The defining themes throughout are the importance of international law and the UN system, the value of multilateral and inclusive dialogue to avoid or de-escalate conflict, and the urgency of tackling global poverty and inequality. Scholars of international relations looking to categorise this overall stance are likely to find liberal multilateralism –\u0026nbspa conventional tradition in the academic literature –\u0026nbspto be the closest fit.\u0026nbspThis is not to imply any sense of business-as-usual. Corbyn’s strongly sceptical view of western military interventionism, together with his critique of corporate-friendly globalisation, situate his policy platform firmly on the left-hand edge of the liberal multilateralist paradigm, and at odds with a great many of its adherents. But these are hardly off-the-wall positions in the context of numerous western policy failures (from the Iraq war to the financial crisis) over the past two decades, and align to some degree with a growing disquiet in the centre left of established thinking.\u0026nbspOne of Corbyn’s most ostensibly challenging positions was the one articulated after the bombings in Manchester during last year’s general election campaign, when he argued that a connection exists between western military interventions in the context of the “war on terror”\u0026nbspand the persistence of the terrorist threat. Again, within the academic literature on non-state violence this is an entirely mainstream and unremarkable analysis\u0026nbspwhen taken with Corbyn’s acknowledgement of the importance of other factors, such as the ideological outlook of the terrorists and their socioeconomic backgrounds. It is also a common view amongst the general public, with 53 per cent of those subsequently polled agreeing with Corbyn’s analysis versus 24 per cent who disagreed, and with voters across all parties more likely to agree with him than not. What generates near hysteria from media pundits and political opponents elicits merely a shrug elsewhere.“Radicalism”\u0026nbspis a relative term. While the formal foreign policies of Corbyn’s Labour are hardly radical when set against the spectrums of expert or public opinion, the underlying view of the international scene that guides Corbyn personally on these matters is very much at odds with that of the political class, and this perhaps is the real source of tension.AFPGetty)Like many on the left of his generation, Corbyn is a product of the 1960s peace movement, opposition to the Vietnam war, and the global campaign against apartheid. His worldview is one that sees modern international relations – specifically the large imbalances in military power and economic autonomy – as the product of centuries of formal empire, out of which a more informal system of quasi-imperialism has evolved in recent decades.\u0026nbspThis sharply contradicts the conventional wisdom of the political establishment, articulated by former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, that “if the world is increasingly ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has, for centuries, been a firefighter”. Many in the global south do not recognise this version of history, to put it mildly. For them, and for much of the grassroots left in Britain, global north states such as the UK are not inherently benign actors, and have in fact long presented a challenge, and even a danger to, the nations and peoples of the south. Evidently Corbyn shares this view – an authentically radical one in relative if not objective terms – and this rather than his formal policy programme seems to be the actual cause of the resentment from his opponents and detractors. There is a palpable sense that Corbyn is regarded by a significant number of them as not just mistaken but treacherous – his crime being a refusal to uphold the official faith in the inherent virtue of British power in the world.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesFormer Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown speaks during the \u0027Jewish Labour Movement Conference\u0027 An inflatable caricature balloon of Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan floats, near Parliament Square in London.

Corbyn’s vision of future UK relations with the global south were set out most clearly in his December 2017 Geneva speech to the UN, where he advocated for British participation in UN peacekeeping missions, a crackdown on tax havens to help protect the fiscal autonomy of developing states, a marked increase in support for refugees, and a stronger response to global warming. There is little reason to suspect that this is a mild veneer disguising a revolutionary reality. Those who knew Corbyn best during his days in the political wilderness affirm that he could never be heard expressing support for violent struggle, with the hard-left former MP George Galloway referring to him rather sniffily as a “woolly Californian”. So even in that area of foreign relations most closely associated with his radicalism – relations with the global south –there is little in his formal policy stances to seriously offend the average genuine liberal, whatever deeper philosophical differences they may have with him.This potential, practical common ground between Corbyn and more pragmatic elements of the centre left is reflected in the resemblance between his preference for dialogue over conflict and that of Barack Obama. In the American context, Obama was the reaction to George W Bush, just as Corbyn was a reaction in the British context to Bush’s valet, Tony Blair. Although each come from different political starting points, they share a scepticism that conflicts can be solved militarily, and a willingness to point to the experiences of the 2000s to underline the point.\u0026nbspObama’s presidency should not be sentimentalised in hindsight, given, to take one example, the active enabling role his administration took in Saudi Arabia’s devastating war on Yemen, and his culpability in the resulting humanitarian disaster. But on Iran at least, Obama took a view (under considerable fire from his opponents) which Corbyn would recognise, namely that diplomacy is most required precisely with people we dislike, and is almost always preferable to military conflict.\u0026nbspHere, Obama’s approach was a direct rebuke to that of his predecessor. When Iran offered a “grand bargain”\u0026nbspto the Bush administration in 2003, offering to withdraw support for Hamas and Hezbollah, sign up to the Arab peace initiative for a two-state settlement to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and submit to nuclear inspections in return for a normalisation of relations, the offer was summarily rejected by Washington on the grounds that “we don’t talk to evil”. It is likely that a lot of subsequent pain in the region could have been avoided had that door not been slammed shut, and Obama’s push for the nuclear deal during his presidency was part of an effort to revive these possibilities, reintegrate Iran into the international system and thus de-escalate wider conflicts and tensions. The other parties to the deal have worked hard to maintain it after President Trump walked away, demonstrating the fact that its strategic wisdom remains widely appreciated.Miliband (pictured with Hillary Clinton) said: ‘If the world is ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has\u0026nbspfor centuries\u0026nbspbeen a firefighter’ – a view sharply contradicted by the Labour leader\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Obama was notoriously careful about spending political capital, and his drive to secure the Iran deal resulted in weaker stances elsewhere, not least on Israel-Palestine where he showed a consistent unwillingness to apply the serious pressure on Israel that any fair resolution to the conflict will require. Israel-Palestine is the issue area where Corbyn is politically weakest due to Labour’s much discussed problems with anti-Semitism, but his policy stance itself is an entirely conventional one: support for a two-state settlement with “a secure Israel alongside a secure and viable state of Palestine”. Moreover, the wisdom of emphasising diplomacy over the “we don’t talk to evil” approach is clearly one that could be usefully applied to this case.When Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian elections, a hypothetical Prime Minister Corbyn at that time might have urged the west to take the approach it eventually took with Iran on the nuclear issue: one that says “we don’t like your ideology or your policies, but we recognise that it’s better to talk through our problems if possible”. Instead, the new government was cast beyond the pale and sanctioned, leading to a civil war between the key Palestinian parties, the isolation of Gaza, over a decade of immiserating siege, several rounds of devastating violence between Hamas and the Israeli military, and the total collapse of the peace process. The recent acceptance from Hamas of a two-state settlement (a position long in gestation within its leadership) hints at the possibilities of what might have transpired had the diplomatic approach been taken from the start. Again, a good deal of pain over the past decade might have been avoided.\u0026nbspOne of the reasons that Obama, a cautious moderate, arrived at a similar place to the more philosophically radical Corbyn in respect of the question of diplomacy over conflict is the experiences of the past decade and a half in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in Libya on his own watch. While Corbyn and Obama would disagree about whether these ventures were crimes or merely mistakes, the upshot places them in the same reality. The application of western military force is repeatedly showing itself in practice to be a futile and destructive endeavour, making the search for negotiated settlements, even in situations as unpromising as Syria, the more attractive or least unattractive proposition. Whether one likes it or not, the west is apparently unable to impose its will militarily on the global south as it once could, forcing a shift of emphasis to diplomacy irrespective of whether that is taken up with reluctance or enthusiasm.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should back a Final Say on the referendumTrump and Obama’s foreign policies are unexpectedly similarThe deeper trends in international relations are also driving in this direction. The end of the Cold War may have given the west a deceptive notion of its own omnipotence, but the slow and steady return of global south powers such as China and India to the levels of international prestige they enjoyed before the ravages of European colonialism only serves to further underline the point that a reliance on mere strength – military, diplomatic or economic – will not serve the global north states well going forward.\u0026nbspAdjusting to these new realities is proving challenging for some in Washington and London. Senior Obama aide Ben Rhodes referred contemptuously to the US foreign policy establishment as “the Blob”, in his frustration with its resistance to his boss’s approach. Across the Atlantic, one senior British general went so far as to threaten a mutiny if Corbyn made any attempt to “emasculate and shrink” the armed forces. Quite the revealing turn of phrase. But the fact remains that the experience of the “war on terror”\u0026nbsphas been a political disaster for Anglo-American militarism, creating space for less chauvinistic figures –\u0026nbspfrom Obama to Ed Miliband to Corbyn – to emerge from various points on the liberal-to-left spectrum, and raising the prospect of some significant policy changes in the future.\u0026nbspNotwithstanding the current right-wing moment in both the UK and the US, the long-term demographic trends point to an inexorable shift in the political balance of power in favour of the Democratic and Labour parties, both of whom have been experiencing internal left-wing insurgencies to varying degrees. There is now a fair prospect of a future President Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren making some degree of common cause on the international stage with a future Prime Minister Corbyn. And while this would not herald a strictly revolutionary change in Anglo-American foreign relations, it would represent a very real and important departure from the days of Bush and Blair.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/06/13/galactic-wind.jpg","title":"galactic wind stars galaxies big bang milky way alma","story":"Created with Sketch.Flows of gas in galaxy 12 billion light years from Earth provide unprecedented insight into formation of stars during\u0026nbspearly days of universeClick to followThe IndependentArtist\u0027s impression showing an outflow of molecular gas, or \u0027galactic wind\u0027, from an active star-forming galaxyPowerful winds from the dawn of the universe have been detected by scientists for\u0026nbspthe first time -\u0026nbsp12 billion light years away from Earth.\u0026nbspTravelling at 500 miles\u0026nbspper second, astronomers think these\u0026nbspgusts of cosmic gas\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspinstrumental in controlling the emergence of stars\u0026nbspand the galaxies they are part of.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Galaxies are complicated, messy beasts, and we think outflows and winds are critical pieces to how they form and evolve, regulating their ability to grow,” explained University of Texas at Austin astronomer Dr Justin Spilker, who led the research.\u0026nbspUsing observations from the ALMA observatory in northern Chile, Dr Spilker and his colleagues were able to detect traces of these winds from a time shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was only one billion years old.Galaxies such as our own, the Milky Way, have a history of relatively slow, controlled star birth, with about one new star emerging every year.However,\u0026nbspthousands of stars can emerge in the same space of time in\u0026nbspstarburst galaxies.\u0026nbspThese\u0026nbspwill rapidly consume the gas reservoir they rely on to form new stars, so their lifes tend to be relatively short.SpilkerS.

large amounts of cold gas flowing outwards from the ancient galaxy at approximately the same rate as new stars are forming.“So far, we have only observed one galaxy at such a remarkable cosmic distance, but we’d like to know if winds like these are also present in other galaxies to see just how common they are,” said Dr Spilker.\u0026nbsp“If they occur in basically every galaxy, we know that molecular winds are both ubiquitous and also a really common way for galaxies to self-regulate their growth.”As gas is ejected away from the galaxies themselves, it will either drift out into the wider universe or gradually rain back down into the galaxy and form stars in a feedback loop.The winds likely form\u0026nbspeither as supernovas within the galaxies explode or due to the effects of supermassive black holes releasing bursts of energy.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are

suppliers has been established, or they have been given the all clear after laboratory tests.The risk of exposure remains “low”, the HSE said\u0026nbspand told the companies to stop supplying the mats

contain\u0026nbspthe deadly carcinogen and which do\u0026nbspnot, schools would have had no indication the materials were unsafe.While unions suggested the gauze mat may have been supplied to schools from 1976, it is understood HSE\u0026nbspofficials believe the issue is a far more recent problem.\u0026nbspAn HSE spokesperson said: “Although the risk of exposure is low, we took action as soon as we were informed.“HSE inspectors ensured supply of the asbestos-containing gauze mats was stopped immediately. We got the message out as soon as possible and alerted schools, colleges and others to the issue, providing precautionary advice on how to check if they are affected and if so what to do next.“Our investigation into the circumstances that led to these particular gauze mats coming into circulation is on going. As part of this, HSE inspectors have served enforcement notices on both companies to ensure that all affected mats are disposed of safely.”But the Nasuwt\u0026nbspteaching union has written to the Department for\u0026nbspEducation (DfE) saying the length of time the companies have been selling products containing asbestos to schools “beggars belief”, and demanded the names of the two suppliers be made public.Chris Keates, the Nasuwt general\u0026nbspsecretary, said: “It is shocking that suppliers, clearly it seems only interested in profit not people, have distributed such life-threatening equipment to schools, putting children and teachers and other staff at risk. “It beggars belief that this situation has been allowed to happen for so long, possibly as far back as 1976.“Whilst it is to be welcomed that the HSE\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbsphighlighted this major hazard to the health of children and young people and all those who work on school sites, it is unacceptable that the two suppliers involved have not been named.”She added: “The Nasuwt believes that the suppliers must be named immediately, not only to enable schools to identify if they have used the suppliers and therefore may have this potentially deadly material on site, but also so that they can be held accountable by those whose health may well have been damaged by using this equipment.“The fact that the HSE has told these suppliers to immediately stop sending the gauze to schools, highlights the seriousness of this issue.”The gauze mats, placed on tripods above Bunsen burners during science lessons, have a white heat-resistant pad at the centre. The presence of tremolite asbestos, which makes up 20-30 per cent of the heat-resistant material, was discovered after testing, HealthandSafetyatWork reports.

Oh my god. I just want to see my son. Now he can go back to school. I am feeling so good,” said the 29-year-old.Critics\u0026nbspbranded the case “truly shocking” and said the act of blocking a UK-born child from returning home was “shameful” and “exactly one of the effects” of the government’s hostile environment policy.Immigration lawyers meanwhile said the case highlighted a problem within UK nationality law: namely that being born in the UK does not automatically make a child British, and that a child’s father is defined as the husband of the mother at the time of birth.After being blocked from boarding his flight, Mohamed had to stay with family friends\u0026nbspin Brussels. His mother was unable to travel to see him\u0026nbspbecause she doesn’t currently hold a passport.Ms Keita, who is of Guinean origin and lives in Sheffield, said the situation had made her feel\u0026nbsp“dead inside”.\u0026nbspShe denied Home Office claims that she received a letter in March stating her son’s passport had been revoked.The Home Office letter, which Ms Keita said she received for the first time by\u0026nbspemail on Sunday, states that the child’s claim to British citizenship was no longer valid because it had “come to light” that the man she was married to at the time of his birth was not settled in Britain.But Ms Keita said that this man was her Guinea-based ex-husband whom she was in the process of orcing. She explained that she had moved to the UK and was living with another partner a British man and the father of Mohamed.Speaking three days after her son was prevented from returning home, she said: “When my friend told me what had happened from the airport, I\u0026nbspcouldn’t believe it. I was very... dead inside. I can’t explain the feeling. It was very difficult.\u0026nbspMEPs (Hawa Keita)I never received a letter. I called them about the problem on Sunday and they sent me it in an email. I’m not crazy enough to send my son out of the country when I know he\u0026nbspdoesn’t have a passport.”Liberal Democrat\u0026nbspMEPs\u0026nbspCatherine\u0026nbspBearder\u0026nbspand Sir Ed\u0026nbspDavey\u0026nbspsent a letter to the home secretary on Wednesday calling on him to act urgently to bring the child home.“We feel it is imperative to get this child on a flight back to Manchester right away. His immigration status should be sorted when he is on home soil with his mother\u0026nbspHawa,” the letter stated.“The lost sleep, lawyers fees and shed tears over this don’t matter right now. All that matters is that we get a frightened six-year-old back to his mother.”UK news in picturesCounter-terrorism police have released images of the two suspects in connection with the Salisbury attack in March.

UK would now vote 54-46 to stay in EU, new poll suggestsBritons would choose to stay in the European Union if given the option now, according to a new opinion poll that showed the highest support for European Union (EU) membership since the 2016 referendum.In total, 59 per cent of voters would vote to remain in the bloc, while 41 percent\u0026nbspwould opt to leave, the survey published as part of an academic led report\u0026nbspby research bodies\u0026nbspNatCen\u0026nbspand the UK in a Changing Europe.\u0026nbspJust over two years ago when voters went to polls in June 2016,\u0026nbsp48 per cent voted to remain and 52 per cent voted to leave.\u0026nbspHowever,\u0026nbspthe poll’s author caveated the findings by saying the interview panel was skewed towards remain and some of those who changed their minds did not take part in the original Brexit referendum.Analysis of different polls by seen by The Independent\u0026nbspearlier this week found more than 2.6 million people had abandoned their support for Brexit and now back staying in the EU.If that number had voted to remain in 2016, Britain would still be a member of the EU.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its own campaign for a Final Say on the Brexit deal\u0026nbspand to date, 750,000\u0026nbsppeople have signed our\u0026nbsppetition calling for a second referendum.Polling expert Sir John Curtice, the author of the new report, cautioned that those interviewed reported they had voted 53 per cent in favour of remain in the referendum — a five\u0026nbsppercentage point higher proportion than the actual vote.“Nevertheless, this still means that there has apparently been a six-point swing from Leave to Remain, larger than that registered by any of our previous rounds of interviewing, and a figure that would seemingly point to a 54 per cent (remain) vote in any second referendum held now,” Sir John\u0026nbspsaid in the report.Speaking at an event to launch it, he added the findings were broadly in line with those of other pollsters, whom he said showed an average of 52.5 per cent support for remain.“Don’t get excited as to think this is some poll that shows a dramatic shift to remain,” Sir John said. “The apparent thin lead that remain have is at least in part built on the potential sand of the responses of those who did not vote two years ago.”Britain is due to leave the EU on 29

Sir John\u0026nbspadded that subsequent polling data, not included in the report, had shown the plan had little support from the public and was unlikely to have reversed voters’ pessimism.He said the results of the polling showed that the most influential factor over whether voters will support the conclusion of the negotiations is their perception of its economic effect rather than the details of any deal.Reuters contributed to this reportThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/16/13/Scot-Mann-MP-1.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6406121  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/16/13/Scot-Mann-MP-1.jpg","title":"operation yellowhammer brexit photo eu rail access nodeal secret paper latest document","story":"Created with Sketch.Government departments will have to make cuts to prepare for crashing out of the EU -

While the \u0027drive\u0027 mode is fairly self-explanatory, the \u0027create mode\u0027 is meant to capitalise on the benefits of the vehicle\u0027s self-driving capabilities.\u0026nbspThe variety of configurations of the seat, table and screens create the perfect environment to read, work on that next big project or enjoy media and other online content whilst driving is delegated to the car, Volvo\u0027s Future of Driving website explains.Current laws in the UK and the US require a driver to keep their hands in contact with the steering wheel, regardless of whether it is capable of driving autonomously.\u0026nbspAs can be expected with a technology like this, there has been a lot of interest in who is held accountable in the event of an accident – the driver, the manufacturer, or the software\u0027s developer.\u0026nbspPerhaps in an effort to push for more lenient legislation in the sector, Volvo has taken the unusual step of saying it will take responsibility for its vehicles\u0027 self-driving capabilities.Volvo will accept full liability for our cars when driven in autonomous mode, said Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson.

This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy, Ms Pressley said. That movement is reshaping a Democratic Party still searching for leaders and identity in the era of Donald Trump.\u0026nbspGrassroots activists on the left have a mixed record in Democratic primaries this election year, but the self-described progressive movement has scored enough victories to suggest its popularity is based on more than just protesting the Trump White House. The movement is also remoulding the Democratic Party into a younger, more erse and decidedly liberal party.\u0026nbspAyanna Pressley and New York\u0027s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two women of colour, both defeated Democratic incumbent congressmen in their primaries. The progressive movement has helped nominate three black Democrats for governor\u0027s seats, including a clear upset in Florida, where Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum knocked off establishment favourite Gwen Graham. Mr Graham\u0027s establishment credentials could not have been stronger. Her father, Bob, is a Florida icon who served as governor and US senator.\u0026nbspGeorgia\u0027s Stacey Abrams, meanwhile, trounced a primary opponent recruited and backed by much of her state\u0027s Democratic old guard. Ms Abrams would become the first black woman elected governor in any US state.\u0026nbspScores of other down-ballot candidates are running for local, state and federal offices with backing from grassroots groups like Inisible, MoveOn.org, the Working Families Party and the offshoot of Bernie Sanders\u0027 2016 presidential campaign, Our Revolution.\u0026nbspWhy it mattersThe ersifying, more liberal slate will be measured by the outcome in the November vote.\u0026nbspRepublicans — and some Democrats — argue that the party is going too far to the left for American voters, particularly outside of the cities and close-in suburbs where Democrats\u0027 base of white liberals and non-white voters is concentrated.\u0026nbspProgressive nominees like Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez are running in Democratic strongholds, so their wins in November are all but guaranteed. But Republicans will use the rise of the left — and its support for policies like single-payer health care and scrapping US Immigration and Customs Enforcement — to tar all Democratic candidates.\u0026nbspThe counter argument from Democrats and activists on the left is two-fold: 1) Many issues that more liberal candidates support — some gun regulation, expanding Medicaid, raising the minimum wage — actually have widespread public support, even among independents and some Republicans and 2) the more openly liberal candidates from outside the old-guard establishment can bring in new voters who do not regularly cast midterm ballots.\u0026nbspBeyond November, the new generation of Democrats will have a say in how the party governs. Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez will not determine whether Democrats pick up the 23 new House seats they need for a majority, but they will help shape the arguments within the Democratic caucus.\u0026nbspThey and their fellow freshmen will have a say in whether a new Democratic majority returns Nancy Pelosi to the speaker\u0027s chair. They will have leverage — much like the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus does with the House GOP leadership — over every debate, from health care to the potential impeachment of Mr Trump.\u0026nbspSo, for example, while there might not be enough support for a real push toward single-payer health care, the movement could draw the party toward supporting a public health insurance option to compete alongside for-profit companies selling policies in Affordable Care Act exchanges. And, even if an immediate $15 minimum wage is too heavy a lift, perhaps the left-flank forces a compromise of graduated raises over time.\u0026nbspWhat to watch out for\u0026nbspDelaware Democrat challenges incumbent as part of \u0027blue tsunami\u0027Democrats take double-digit lead over Republicans ahead of midtermsDemocrats need to focus on young people in the 2018 midterm elections Trump unprepared for impeachment and Democratic takeover: reportSanders-backed progressive could become Florida\u0027s first black governorBefore primary season concludes, there are a few more key match-ups to measure the left\u0027s influence. In Delaware, military veteran and activist Kerri Evelyn Harris is aiming on Thursday to knock off moderate Democratic Senator Tom Carper. She is a big underdog, but even a competitive finish will serve notice anew that incumbents must at least contend with the left base. Similar dynamics exist in New York, where actress Cynthia Nixon is trying to topple Governor Andrew Cuomo in a 13 September primary.\u0026nbspSome of the most intent observers of the party\u0027s evolution are the gaggle of aspiring presidential candidates. Certainly, some of those figures have helped drive the shift — Mr Sanders and his 2016 campaign, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and her outspoken economic populism.\u0026nbspBut Mr Sanders, Ms Warren and the rest are also careful to watch the base and not get caught flat-footed as it evolves. That is one reason potential candidates like Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden have made sure that their endorsement and campaign finance activity this midterm cycle has ned the spectrum of the party\u0027s down-ballot candidates: If the so-called progressive movement becomes the centre of the party, no one who wants to be the Democratic presidential nominee boxed out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/04/14/xi-jinping-china-africa.jpg","title":"china africa bejing forum investment interest free loans","story":"Created with Sketch.China\u0027s Xi Jinping\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspinvestment comes with \u0027no political strings attached\u0027Click to followThe IndependentChinese President Xi Jinping, centre, with South Africa\u0027s Cyril Ramaphosa, centre left, and other leaders behind, attend the 2018 Beijing FOCAC summitRepresentatives from\u0026nbspalmost every country in Africa dined with Xi Jinping on Monday night as they attended what is believed to be the largest gathering of African heads of state ever staged\u0026nbspoutside the continent.They had plenty to toast, after China’s President Xi pledged new infrastructure investments in their countries of $60bn\u0026nbsp(£46bn) ning the next three years.The latest investment\u0026nbspis in addition to the $60bn\u0026nbsppledged back in\u0026nbsp2015, and promises to continue the remarkable growth of China-backed building projects across the African segment, known as the Belt and Road Initiative.China now far outstrips the economic clout and engagement in Africa of either the US or Europe, and its involvement has inevitably sparked criticism.Malaysia’s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, warned against what he called a “new version of colonialism” last month when he cancelled a $20bn Chinese-backed rail project.And in his speech addressing leaders at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, Mr Xi appeared to acknowledge these concerns, saying Chinese investment came with “no political strings attached”.“China does not interfere in Africa’s internal affairs and does not impose its own will on Africa,” he said. “More than 1.3 billion Chinese people and more than 1.2 million African people have always pursued a shared future.“We respect Africa, love Africa and support Africa.”Since Mr Xi’s announcement, African heads of state have similarly sought to play down any suggestion that China’s interests are in anything other than mutual economic growth.Zimbabwe’s newly elected president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, hit out at critics of China in an interview on state TV.“There is now a transition to a new world order and those who don’t see it are blind,” he said.Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president, said the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing was working towards “a vision that has been crafted in Africa, by Africans… of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa”.May overlooked a vast humanitarian crisis on her Africa tourNever mind Brexit, the South Africans will love us after May’s dancingTheresa May’s visit to Robben Island is insultingThe UK securing trade deals in Africa doesn’t make much senseMay makes ‘unashamed’ vow to use aid to boost UK firms in Africa“FOCAC refutes the view that a new colonialism is taking hold in Africa, as our detractors would have us believe,” he added.Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, the current African Union chairman and a fierce critic in the past of foreign aid, said he considered China to be a “more respectful partner” than either Europe or America.“The relationship between Africa and China is based on equality, mutual respect and a commitment to a shared well-being,” he said. “Our growing ties with China do not come at anyone’s expense.”Some experts are not so sure. The International Monetary Fund warned in April that at least 40 per cent of low-income countries in Africa are either in debt distress or at high risk. Since the last FOCAC forum in South Africa in 2015, a number of countries have attempted to restructure their debt.But Chinese officials have previously denied taking part in so-called “debt trap” diplomacy, and on Monday Mr Xi said government debt from China’s interest free loans due by the end of 2018 will be written off for indebted poor African countries.“Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise,” Mr Xi warned, an apparent reference to an ongoing trade war between his country and Donald Trump’s America.“China-Africa cooperation under the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) is a way to common prosperity that brings benefits to both our peoples.”The only African country not represented in Beijing at the summit, which continued on Tuesday with meetings between business leaders and entrepreneurs, was newly-renamed eSwatini, formerly Swaziland.That’s because it is now the only nation left in Africa still conducting diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the self-ruled territory claimed by China. Beijing refuses to do business with any country that maintains ties to Taipei – business which the rest of the African continent has decided it cannot afford to lose.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/03/13/women-malaysia.jpg","title":"malaysia lesbian couple public caning islam mahathir mohamad","story":"Created with Sketch.Two women punished for attempting to have sex in a carClick to followThe IndependentTwo women were caned in front of 100 people in a Malaysian courtroom for attempting to take part in lesbian sexThe Malaysian prime minister has said the public caning of a lesbian couple had “tarnished Islam’s reputation”.Two Muslim women, 22 and 32, were arrested and sentenced for attempting to have sex in a car.They were caned six times each in front of more than 100 people, including members of their own family.Women caned in Malaysia for attempting to have lesbian sexTwo women in Malaysia sentenced to caning for having sexThe prime minister of Malaysia, Dr Mahathir\u0026nbspBin Mohamad, has attacked the public caning and said it tarnished\u0026nbspIslam\u0027s reputation as a merciful and compassionate religion.Under both religious and secular laws, homosexual activity is illegal but this is the state’s first conviction for same-sex relations and the first public caning, the\u0026nbspBBC\u0026nbspreported.Mr Mahathir said the caning did not reflect the justice or compassion of Islam.He said in a video on social media that the women could have been given a lighter sentence and counselling as it was their first offence.Islamic officials defended the caning, saying it was not meant to hurt the women, but was intended to educate them so they will repent.World news in picturesUS Capitol Police arrest a protestor as Judge Brett Kavanaugh testifies during the second day of his US Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing to be an Associate Justice on the US Supreme Court.

In our experiment, both of these events can happen first.\u0026ldquoThis is called \u0026lsquoindefinite causal order\u0026rsquo and it isn\u0026rsquot something that we can observe in our everyday life.The physicists made this discovery using a set-up they called a photonic quantum switch.Researcher Dr Fabio Costa explained that with the device, they could see that the order events depends on polarisation \u0026ndash a lightwaves\u0026rsquo ability to travel in more than one direction.He said: \u0026ldquoBy measuring the polarisation of the photons at the output of the quantum switch, we were able to show the order of transformations on the shape of light was not set.\u0026ldquoThis is just a first proof of principle, but on a larger scale indefinite causal order can have real practical applications, like making computers more efficient or improving communication.I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.

He knows now.Last week, Field quit the Labour Party whip amid a barrage of “intolerance, nastiness and intimidation” from Corbyn outriders over his stand against anti-Semitism.Along with other moderate Labour MPs, he was battered by Twitter storms using the vilest language to wish him dead.Field bluntly accuses Jeremy Corbyn of racism and hints he is ready to force a by-election if kicked out of the Labour Party. Others facing deselection may follow suit.Leadership critics have endured relentless bullying and abuse, a trademark of the brutal machine which swept Jezza to power and intends to keep him there. As Frank Field himself now admits, Corbyn is going nowhere.The party might split but the ageing hippy “will lead Labour into the next election”. Corbyn’s sullen anti-Semitism triggered this revolt, but it is only a symptom of the sinister nature of hard-Left politics which brooks no criticism.Labour really is the Nasty Party. Jezza’s pro-Russian, anti-capitalist malcontents loathe everything the UK and other Western democracies stand for.They support some of the world’s most brutal tyrannies and catastrophic economies while railing against free speech and Press freedom.Corbyn sees no evil in these repressive forces and this week shelved an invitation from MI5 chiefs to show him the secret intelligence. On such evidence alone, it is fair to say Corbyn as PM would permanently damage this country, its freedoms and its prosperity.We knew all this when Ed Miliband threw open the party’s leadership to anyone with three quid to buy a vote. Thanks to his stunning act of stupidity, the “broad church” Labour Party of Clem Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell, John Smith and Tony Blair is history.It lives on in name only, an empty husk colonised by Momentum parasites who once fought the party they now own. Corbyn didn’t even want the job, telling supporters: “You’d better make f***ing sure I don’t win.”When he surprised himself by storming to victory in 2015, shell-shocked Blairite MPs assumed they could get rid of him if he stepped too far out of line.They tried that in 2016 — turning Jezza into the unassailable champion of the loony Left and handing over the keys to the asylum. Theresa May bolted him in place with her botched General Election. No wonder the Glastonbury millennials cooed: “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn.”Have we learned from Frank Field’s mistake? Or do we believe, as he did, voters will never be silly enough to give Corbyn the keys to power? Well, look at the polls. They show nobody much rates Jezza, but Labour remains neck and neck with the Tories.Theresa May has yet to navigate her way to a tricky Brexit deal with Brussels — or to a no-deal rejected by Commons Remainers. She has rightly turned her face against a second referendum, a democratic abomination.But who knows who will be leader by then? Boris Johnson is circling, helped by a growing team of sponsors and supporters. Mrs May would do anything to stop BoJo. She is even seeking official advice on another snap election gamble. Good luck with that, Theresa. But Remainers should be careful what they wish for.Corbyn, a fervent fan of arch-Eurosceptic Tony Benn, loathes the EU as much as the angry Labour supporters who voted Leave. But he would conveniently bury that hatred for the time being if it meant riding a Remainer wave into Downing Street.Pro-Brussels campaigner Keir Starmer would emerge, not for the first time, as a “useful idiot”.The Purge will have just begun.At a media event before his referendum, the ex-oil analyst confidently bet the price would not crash below 50 a barrel. It did. He sent me my winnings but they apparently went astray.So he offered double-or-quits. The price stayed below 50 for yet another year – and is still only a bit higher today.

She says we can leave in a safe and orderly manner through the Chequers plan or we can leave dangerously and chaotically if we don’t agree a departure deal with Europe.In truth, there are other choices. We could surrender less sovereignty by proposing a conventional trade agreement, as Davis suggested in a white paper that was rejected by the PM.But his proposal was never published, and Davis is now on the backbenches.We could join the European Economic Area, like Norway, leaving us subject to European laws, including free movement, and paying into the Brussels budget.Advocates, including the Tory MP Nick Boles, say this would buy us time to sort out our long-term relationship with Europe, but we would risk getting stuck half-in, half-out of the EU for years.Whatever the merits of his case, however, Boles is a backbench MP who cannot impose policy on the Government.Because Theresa May is the Prime Minister, Chequers is the only policy on the table. But Chequers, as bad as it already is, will not be the final deal.Downing Street insiders insist it is “obtainable” without further compromises, while the PM says she will not accept compromises “that are not in our national interest”. But this is the problem: There will be further compromises, which come on top of an already flawed proposal.And this is hardly a surprise, because Chequers is unacceptable to the Europeans.The EU’s number one rule is that the “four freedoms” of its single market — in goods, services, people and capital — cannot be divided.And yet Chequers — as unacceptable as it is to British Eurosceptics — seeks to divide these four freedoms.Britain is effectively asking to stay in the single market for trade in goods but not in services, people and capital.If we want what we have proposed for goods, the Europeans will say we must accept the other obligations.As part of an agreement about services, they will insist on Britain accepting more EU laws and a greater role for the European Court.They are likely to demand financial contributions and access to British waters for their fishing industry.And while they might not call it free movement, they will insist on concessions that grant Europeans almost automatic access to the British labour market.This prediction is not plucked out of thin air. It is based on decades of EU policymaking, and everything European leaders and their negotiators have said since the referendum.It is reflected in the EU’s own negotiating guidelines, issued to the European Commission by the Council of Ministers.And it is why, in her Lancaster House speech last year, Theresa May ruled out single market membership.Having to accept its obligations, she said, “would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all”.And yet this is the danger we now face. According to several Government sources, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is “itching” to make a “generous offer” on immigration. Some believe he wants to retain free movement rules, because he says we cannot get a good trade deal unless we do so.Theresa May, on the other hand, is adamant that free movement must end.But whether or not we are legally part of EU free movement rules, the question is whether her deal will regain full control of immigration to Britain. And what we know already is alarming.There is nothing wrong with allowing tourists to come here easily, students to attend British universities and business people to travel without bureaucracy.Nor is there a problem with firms moving their workers across borders quickly and easily to provide services.And it makes sense to give Europeans preferential access to Britain compared to people from further away.But few ministers care about reducing immigration, and the Chequers white paper is remarkably open about the options. It proposes, for example, a “youth mobility scheme” that would give young Europeans the right to live and work in Britain for fixed periods.Without strict limits, this alone could destroy meaningful immigration control, because most people who want to migrate are young.Around 64 per cent of EU migrants to Britain are under 30, while 86 per cent are younger than 40.The white paper suggests “other specific mobility areas”, without giving further details. It proposes “social security coordination” which might allow migrants to claim benefits for children living back home in countries like Poland.And it says nothing about our ability to deport or bar European criminals from Britain.Most worryingly, there is no proposal for a visa system for European workers.Without that, unskilled and low-skilled immigration will continue without limit.It does not need to be like this.We are discussing these unacceptable compromises because Chequers proposes partial membership of the EU’s single market.If we want to escape Europe’s laws, its court and its demands for our money — and if we want to control immigration — the Government needs to revive its plans for a free trade agreement, and it needs to do so urgently.Unless it does, Brexit will not mean Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But one of ­Parliament’s biggest secrets is that most of the men and women in it are actually pretty decent.What rightly makes voters angry with Parliament is that it doesn’t look like the country it represents, and approves policies that often make the world a worse place. In the current Parliament, 29 per cent of UK-educated MPs went to private schools.This is a record low, but it is out of step with the public, which is around seven per cent privately educated. Only 32 per cent of MPs are women, and 7.8 per cent are from ethnic minorities, while roughly 14 per cent of the general population is black or minority ethnic.The majority of MPs were already working in politics before being elected or held well-paid jobs as lawyers.In my new book, Why We Get The Wrong Politicians, I’ve discovered one of the main reasons why only well-off people become MPs. It’s because they have to spend tens of thousands of pounds of their own money on standing for Parliament.I asked 532 candidates who stood in the 2015 election how much it had cost them, and was shocked by the answers. The average cost for all candidates, whether they were standing in a seat that they’d certainly win, one where they might win or a no-hope constituency, was £11,118.For those who had to fight in marginal seats, the costs were even higher. Conservatives who won their seats spent £121,467. Their colleagues who failed to win still lost an average of £18,701.Labour was no better. If you won your seat, you lost around £19,022, but those who failed to get elected spent even more — £35,843.Some spent money they had saved to buy a home. Others maxed out their credit cards and are still paying off the debts today. This money didn’t go on leaflets or any of the other official campaign spending that is tightly regulated.Instead, it was working for free for up to two years, travelling around and sometimes even moving to the constituency, and attending local events. One broke candidate needed help from members of her party to pay her mortgage. She didn’t even win her seat.Another ex-candidate was delighted when he landed a new job and could afford to buy a house — before he realised he’d spent the deposit on campaigning, ironically for the “party of home ownership”.This ludicrous cost excludes so many people who would make much better MPs than the ones we currently have. MPs do not really do the job they’ve been elected to perform, anyway.The pressure is for them to do as their whips tell them, rather than to look at the legislation going through the House of Commons. Most vote on bills without realising what they might entail.Even when they are appointed to the bill committees scrutinising every line of a law, MPs in the governing party are told to sit quiet and vote with the Government every time. Many write their Christmas cards in these committees.From the “bedroom tax” to interventions in Iraq and Libya, MPs have failed to notice problems before they turn into real crises.It doesn’t have to be like this. The parties could pay their candidates to stand. The Conservatives have already announced a modest bursary fund, and Labour has toyed with the idea too. Other groups should stump up some funding as well.The Women’s Equality Party, for instance, is stunningly well-funded but has little chance of getting an MP elected. It would be much better to use that money to get more women MPs in all the political parties. Currently MPs don’t have to take any responsibility for approving dud policies.My book suggests a new stage for legislation, called “Public Payback Panels” where people directly affected by a government policy could ask the minister and members of the bill committee who approved it to explain why they voted the way they did.This would encourage politicians to take their job seriously and really look at the laws they were approving.If this doesn’t change, MPs will still have the most expensive job interview on Earth — and will then be told when they arrive in Parliament not to do their job.

The company should be renamed Two-Facedbook.Lucy McHugh’s body was found in Hampshire woodland six weeks ago. She had been stabbed to death.Police arrested Stephen Nicholson, 24, a care worker who had been living with Lucy’s family, on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with a child.Nicholson admits being in contact with Lucy via Facebook on the evening before her disappearance and on the morning of the tragic day. But he refused to give police his Facebook password so they could check what was said.Nicholson was prosecuted for refusing to cooperate with the investigation. His lawyer said his client was afraid cops would find evidence of his involvement with cannabis.The judge dismissed this excuse as “wholly inadequate”, surely putting it mildly.Last week Nicholson was jailed for 14 months for preventing police from checking his messages. In the UK, failing to cooperate with police is an offence under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. He got a much longer term than he would ever get for smoking dope.Meanwhile Facebook — a US company not bound by our laws — refused a police request to divulge Nicholson’s password.Detectives had to apply to the US authorities for an order giving access to Nicholson’s account. That process could take many months.Facebook insists it cannot give police quick access, because of its commitment to privacy and freedom of expression. That excuse sounds even more pathetic than Nicholson’s dopey cannabis story.Yes, privacy and free speech are crucial principles to defend, including online.But in practice, Facebook has as much regard for those freedoms as a police-state apparatchik.Its bosses’ one serious commitment is to their freedom to rake in cash. They monitor our private lives and make money off our likes and desires.Facebook and other tech giants use our online activity to target advertising and allow companies access to our data. As for free speech, Facebook has been busy closing right-wing pages that do not suit its leftie Silicon Valley tastes.It says it will not tolerate “hate speech and harassment”. When it comes to child murder suspects, it apparently takes a more liberal attitude.Facebook has bizarrely chosen the case of Stephen Nicholson to strike a phoney pose as a stalwart defender of privacy and freedom.Double standards don’t come much lower. This looks like a grossly misjudged attempt at moral grandstanding designed to repair Facebook’s right-on reputation.It appears more likely to have the opposite effect, lowering its standing still further.We should never take the issue of privacy and state intervention lightly. In a free society, the police should not be given licence to pry and poke into our affairs and online activities as they see fit.We must be on our guard against the creeping advance of state snooping.But the demand for privacy can also be used to the detriment of a free and civilised society. After Sir Cliff Richard won his privacy case against the BBC over the reporting of a police raid on his home, many have demanded “Cliff’s law” be enforced to prevent the media naming those suspected of serious crimes.In a terrible case such as the murder of Lucy McHugh, it surely ought to be possible to work out a fast way to access the chief suspect’s Facebook account — he having chatted with the victim shortly before she disappeared — without declaring open season for police snoopers.The law must be changed to help police get data in cases like this — so long as that law is tightly framed and properly scrutinised.Facebook can posture and hide behind the US courts but our media is subject to a full book of laws that have empowered police and state agencies to demand news- papers hand over sensitive information and name their confidential sources. No passwords required. Some publishers, it seems, have more freedom than others.Facebook’s two-faced bosses should be brought to book for their double standards on privacy and their blatant disregard for the public good.

They do not like Jews.The evidence for that is so categorical and so widespread across the left of the party that nobody can doubt it now.Certainly I don’t. Nor does our Jewish community, which is genuinely worried by the ­hideous Corbyn.If you’ve got your doubts then I just don’t know what WOULD convince you.Maybe CCTV of Corbyn torching a synagogue and screaming “Intifada!” Would that do it? Or would you respond by saying, ah, he was actually worried that the people inside the synagogue might be a bit cold. That’s why he threw the firebomb in.Or maybe the excuse Corbyn himself comes up with, every time. It wasn’t me! I wasn’t there!Then, when it’s proved that he was: “Oh, um, yes. But I didn’t really know what I was doing.”As I’ve said before, Corbyn’s defence is always to portray himself as a complete moron who doesn’t know where he is or what he’s doing. It doesn’t wash. He’s an anti-Semite.But there’s another group of people who know this only too well. And they’re doing very little about it.That’s the Labour MPs. The ones who cannot abide Corbyn and Momentum and want him gone. The Old Labour Party, the one we used to have before the lefty infants took over.But they do nothing. Not a thing, apart from moan quietly in the background.If ever there was a time for a split, for a new party to be formed which might capture the attention of the voters, this is it.But they don’t have the balls. Or they are scared to lose their safe seats and their nice incomes. That’s probably a false hope too, mind. Corbyn isn’t going anyplace anytime soon.And if he did another lunatic would take over who might conceivably be worse. And Momentum now control the entire party. So, one after another, the moderate Labour MPs will be deselected and lose their seats anyway.The ones who think Israel has a right to exist.The ones who don’t think Cuba and Venezuela have particularly brilliant governments.The ones who don’t want to police newspapers which don’t agree with them.The MPs whose first consideration is poverty and inequality, not identity politics and fatuous agitprop grandstanding.So far only one of these has made a stand — the excellent Frank Field. He has resigned the Labour whip, disgusted at ­Corbyn’s anti-Semitism.All it would take is three or four more and suddenly we would have a new political party.So, what about it, Kate Hoey? And the former Blairite, Caroline Flint? And Ben Bradshaw? And John Mann?Are you telling me you’re happy where you are, in today’s Labour Party? Or are you just waiting for someone to come and rescue you?You’ve got a long wait. You have to do it yourselves.I WAS feeling a bit sorry for Roxanne Pallett.She made a mistake, only a kid really – and now she’s lost everything.And then I saw an interview with her.Dense as a slab of tungsten – although I suppose that’s not her fault.I mean, if you were born with only a five-watt bulb flickering away inside your skull it’s not something that can be changed very easily, is it?But more than that, it was her absolute self-absorption.Everything was about me, me, me.Not the hurt she had caused to others, but the misery she’d inflicted on HERSELF.It’s a common condition these days, I suppose.But Pallett is a pretty extreme example.SEEN what’s been happening in Germany?Huge demonstrations against immigration in Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx Stadt.The BBC and others say it’s all the “far right”. Neo Nazis. People with posters of Hitler in their bedrooms.I daresay there are a few nasty types on those marches who wish there was still a Gestapo. But I think the vast majority of those demonstrating are ordinary German citizens, sick of what has happened to their country.And the same thing has been happening across Europe.It’s not the far right at all, no matter how often the liberals tell you it is.GREAT call from the President of the Philippines, a bloke called Rodrigo Duterte.According to him, if women want to avoid being raped they should not be so beautiful.Maybe they should have all their teeth removed? Men won’t want to give one to someone who is totally toothless. It’ll put them off completely.The women could also slice their noses off.Or have facial surgery to make them resemble an anteater or a pipistrelle bat.The world has its fair share of dimbo leaders. But Rodrigo is right there near the top.SO the latest plan is to put road markings on the pavement.It’s so zombies attached to their iPhones, staring at the ground, don’t walk into the middle of a road or off the edge of a cliff.There has been a rise in accidents involving pedestrians who are locked tightly into their own little world.I have been nearly flattened by joggers immersed in some crap pounding through their thick skulls. And nobody talks to anybody any more. We discuss banning the burka from public spaces.But is there anything more antisocial than someone with their head down, oblivious to the world around them?ANNOYED that her partner had allegedly cheated on her, Serena Reynoldson filmed herself pouring bleach into his tropical fish tank while cackling, “Die, die, die!” Which is what they did, of course.I think her ex, Jon Fitzpatrick, is well out of it, frankly.It all seems a bit hard on the poor fish. So far as we know, they hadn’t cheated on Ms Reynoldson. Mr Fitzpatrick also had a snake, which was lucky to get out of the place alive.I think the moral is if you’re going to upset your missus, make sure you have pets that can look after themselves. A Tasmanian devil, say, or a king cobra.WHY has Jose Mourinho not been sacked by Manchester United?I don’t mean because his team are not terribly good. Or about as pleasing to watch as John Prescott eating a curry.But he’s just been handed a one-year suspended prison sentence and hit with whopping fines – for tax evasion running into the millions of pounds.Does Manchester United not have any principles?I’LL be glued to the box watching The Mighty Redcar on BBC2 tonight. Seeing that the town is only a stone’s throw from my gaff in Saltburn.I was worried at first that it was just another poverty-porn film.You know, when the BBC turns up somewhere north of Watford so everyone can have a good old snigger at the people who live there.But having spoken to some of the people who took part, it isn’t like that at all.Redcar’s had it rough and wages are low. Both Labour and the Tories have let down the steelworkers, who are no more.But there are plenty of new businesses thriving, beyond the BBC’s cameras.Redcar will be just fine in the end, just as it was when I lived there in the Seventies.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The richest one per cent pay 27 per cent of all income tax, as opposed to just 11 under Labour in the 1970s. Raising the top rate nets LESS money since the wealthiest find ways to avoid it, or leave.Low corporation tax is partly behind the incredible job creation since 2010. Reverse it and see the dole queues grow.And an avalanche of taxes on wealth won’t bring equality. The overall burden is near a 30-year high. Raising it further will kill aspiration, investment and jobs.To help the poor, CUT their taxes instead.WE’RE not swallowing the Treasury scares about jobs being at risk if restaurants are made to put calorie counts on their menu.Food apps can assess a dish’s calories in moments.

It’s far more likely to persuade them to pick a healthier option too.The problem is enforcing it. We don’t want council “calorie cops” giving firms a hard time.

Its a place where people seek refuge.”Their top of the range bunker, The Aristocrat costs £8.9 million excluding the installation fee.It has a capacity for more than 50 people in ying degrees of luxury and features bullet proof doors, a solar generated charging system, a swimming poll, bowling lane and gun range, amongst other luxuries.Even an ex- Kiwi Prime Minister has noticed the uptick in interest from wealthy Americans in his country as an escape plan.John Key, who was New Zealand’s PM from 2008-2016, said: “Ive had a lot of people say to me that they would like to own a property in New Zealand if the world goes to hell in a hand basket.”The two most recent 990 square feet bunkers sent to the nation from the States were each taken on 19 trailers having been split into sections.One was installed in the North Island of New Zealand while the other was secreted away in the even more sparsely populated South Island.Paypal co-founder, and Facebook billionaire, Peter Thiel built a £3.7 million home in Queenstown New Zealand complete with a panic room.His buddy, and fellow entrepreneur, Sam Altman also let slip that he has plans to catch a flight out there if a pandemic ever hits.And LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman told The New Yorker last year that, “saying you’re ‘buying a house in New Zealand’ is kind of a wink, wink, say no more”.Other wealthy US entrepreneurs who have bought properties in the country include film director James Cameron and billionaire hedge fund manager Julian Robinson.A total of 17 Americans took advantage of the New Zealand’s Investor Plus Visa - which requires a 10million investment over 36 months – last year.But it is believed that the rush of investment from billionaires fearing the worst could have been one of the motivating factors behind a new law banning many foreigners from buying homes.Fortunately New Zealand isn’t the only place the super-rich have looked to to ride out the End of Days.Luxurious bolt holes to ride out the nuclear winter have sprung up, or rather burrowed under, across the US and EuropeYour father or grandfathers bunker was not very comfortable, Robert Vicino, the CEO of high-end shelter company Vivos, told CNN.They were grey. They were metal, like a ship or something military. And the truth is mankind cannot survive long-term in such a Spartan, bleak environment.It may seem like an over-the-top purchase designed for the super-paranoid - but sports stars, hedge fund managers and even tech gurus including Bill Gates are rumoured to have invested in bunkers.Trident Lakes survival community and country club offers condos that are 90 per cent sheltered with lagoons, a golf course and equestrian centre above groundBut while some want to bunker down alone with their loved ones, other companies have cashed in on our desire to be in a community - and feel closer to the real world, even in the face of disaster.Missile silos and military bunkers have been transformed into condos and underground villages - complete with cinemas, swimming pools and leisure areas.Vivos Xpoint, in South Dakota, is made up of 575 military bunkers - and is being developed to accommodate 5,000 people.The bomb-proof holiday homes cost between £20,000 and £160,000, while the underground village will include a cinema, classroom, gardens, doctors surgery, spa and gym.The company also offer a modern day Noahs Ark, in a former Cold War-era munitions storage facility in Germany, which includes 34 properties sized between 2,500 and 5,000 square feet.This particular shelter will include a tram network to transport residents to the bunkers restaurants, coffee shops, pool, cinema and game rooms.We have all the comforts of home, but also the comforts that you expect when you leave your home, Robert added."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431505370.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"locals complain oxford city council resurface posh end street","story":"The new tarmac runs to the spot where a spike-topped wall once divided council houses from the rich households down the road in Oxford.The suburban street is still split into two ends where the wealthy Wentworth Road meets the less affluent Aldrich Road in Sunnymead.Following a row with Oxford City Council the dividing wall was demolished 60 years ago.But now a stark reminder of the past appeared on the road when workers repaired only the posh end.An angry vandal armed with a spray can tagged the words class war on to the gleaming new tarmac in protest.Naomi Langlais, who lives on the working class end of the street, said: It was around April or May time that they decided the middle class side deserved to be resurfaced.So we waited patiently for our end to be resurfaced too and thought it was just taking time as they had run out of money or something.But we soon realised it was just the one end they were doing, apparently we should put up with potholes and uneven surfacing.The mum-of-four added: We have not moved on at all - now we have a visual divide but much less obvious one.It is just so weird it stops at the exact spot that used to occupy the wall, half way down the road.The resurfacing is desperately needed on our end as well.It does make you feel second class and it is no longer a council estate, people have paid a lot of money for houses this end.A plaque now sits on the house which neighboured the wall, and reads: Here stood one of the two Cutteslowe Walls erected 1934 and finally demolished on March 9, 1959.Oxford City Council said the reason that its services company only resurfaced one side of the divide is that Wentworth and Aldrich are still classed as separate roads.A spokesman for the city council said: The structural condition was far worse in Wentworth Road and this led to the decision to resurface this road first.Wentworth and Aldrich are different roads and the need to resurface Wentworth was greater.Oxford Direct Services will be inspecting Aldrich Road to assess the need for pothole repair."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431519555.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mona lisa smile caused under active thyroid","story":"US based experts now think the smirk was caused by an under-active thyroid gland.Known as hypothyroidism it can cause swollen hands, thinning hair and a lump in the neck - all visible in the portrait.According to new research this was the condition triggered the enigmatic facial expression of Leonardo da Vincis famous model.It was spurred by not eating enough dairy products, seafood and meat - and her earlier pregnancy.The smile may be due to disability caused by muscle weakness, US medics suggested.Professor of Medicine Dr Mandeep Mehra, medical director of the Heart \u0026amp Vascular Centre at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston, said: The enigma of the Mona Lisa can be resolved by a simple medical diagnosis of a hypothyroidism-related illness.In many ways, it is the allure of the imperfections of disease that give this masterpiece its mysterious reality and charm.Previous examinations of the 16th century masterpiece have suggested she was suffering high cholesterol, heart disease - or even syphilis.But Prof Mehra and colleague Dr Hilary Campbell of the California University in Santa Barbara said this is not possible owing to the fact she lived to the age of 63.The limited treatments available at the time would have meant she would have died much younger.Instead the new analysis published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings reveals noblewoman Lisa Gherardini - widely believed to be the subject - displays classic signs of hypothyroidism.Her hands look swollen and it appears shes losing her hair. She also has yellowed skin and what seems to be a goiter - or lump - in the neck.Hypothyroidism in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones can cause all these symptoms.The researchers said: The painting suggests a yellowish discolouration of the skin, which is known to occur in hypothyroidism.The black veil that hangs below what appears to be a large forehead indicates a receding hair line, with hair that appears to be thinned.A complete lack of eyebrows or other hair throughout the pale skin further supports this diagnosis, and cascading hair down the side appears coarse in character.Curiously, a close look at the neck does insinuate the possible presence of a diffuse enlargement such as a goiter.They said swelling in the right hand further supports the theory as this is often noted in advanced stages of hypothyroidism.LISA Gherardini is thought to have posed for the painting between 1503 and 1506.She is believed to have been born in Florence in 1479.At the age of 16 she became the second wife of a wealthy silk merchant, Francesco del Giocondo, with whom she had five children.She became a nun after his death and moved into the SantOrsola convent, a Franciscan monastery.She stayed there for the last four years of her life and is believed to have died in the convent in 1542 and to have been buried near the altar.The portrait that came to be known as the Mona Lisa now hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris.It was completed by Leonardo in 1506 when she was about 24.Subsequently, the painting was taken to France in 1516 and adorned the court of King Francis I until its permanent display in the Louvre in 1797.Its believed Francesco Del Giocondo commissioned the portrait to celebrate the birth of their child, Andrea, in 1502.The researchers said: In this circumstance, if Lisa Gherardini was indeed suffering from severe hypothyroidism or its consequences, the mysterious smile may at one level be representative of some psychomotor retardation and muscle weakness leading to a less than fully blossomed smile.The condition can be caused by a lack of iodine - found in dairy products, seafood, meat, bread and eggs.This was a common problem among Italians during the Renaissance. Resulting goiters were commonly depicted in paintings and sculptures.The researchers said: Thus, the diet was one that was often iodine deficient and more importantly, the eating habits promoted the development of goiters.Dr Mehra and Dr Campbell also pointed out Lisa Gherardini gave birth shortly before she began sitting for da Vinci.Pregnancy can also contribute to inflaming the gland."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000429908322.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa mays african boogies have made her a dancing icon as 5000 people sign up to event to learn the prime ministers moves","story":"A Facebook page for the “Learn to Dance Like Theresa May Day” in Liverpool has proved wildly popular after coverage of her trade trip last week was dominated by her awkward jiving.It even has a guide so you can emulate the dance, with mocking suggestions such as getting into the “T-Rex” pose and then swinging your arms “in a jerky motion as if trying to prove to your parents you are sober”.Similar events have been arranged in other cities for the same day, although it is unclear how many people are actually planning on attending.The posts also offer handy instructions so people can perfect the moves showcased by Mrs May at home too.It suggests people: “Start walking forward in a slow, mechanical fashion out of time to the music and with arms still positioned like the large dinosaur, but with torso waving like a tree in a mild breeze.”The PM sparked this situation when she was filmed joining in a dance with a group of schoolchildren in Cape Town last week.And when she left South Africa for Nairobi she took her dancing shoes with her, and was seen getting very involved with a group of Kenyan scouts.Her bizarre dancing was compared to the Inbetweeners and footballer Peter Crouch, famous for his robot celebration.The former England star mocked her “picking apples” routine, adding: “Shes going straight through my repertoire on this trip.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is not what anyone voted for in 2016.“We were promised ‘sunlit uplands’, but what’s being delivered instead is a public policy disaster with severe implications for the future of our country."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431531868.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ancient church that once stood in the historic city of nicaea found submerged in a turkish lake 1600 years later","story":"The ruined Christian church discovered in Turkeys Lake Iznik is believed to have been built around 390 AD.The church lies ten feet below the water, about 160 feet from the shore of Lake Iznik, historically known as Nicaea where a Christian creed was adopted in 325 AD.Professor Mustafa Şahin, the head of archaeology at Bursa Uludağ University, said: When I first saw the images of the lake, I was quite surprised to see a church structure that clearly.I was doing field surveys in Iznik [since 2006], and I hadnt discovered such a magnificent structure like that.He believes the church marks the place where Saint Neophytos was martyred in 303 AD and that it was built in his honour.Archaeologists have excavated parts of the underwater site since 2015, using a system of powerful vacuum nozzles.The nozzles removes soil from the underwater site and transports it to the shore, where it can be carefully sifted for artefacts.He said the church may have been built on top of a pagan temple to Apollo, a Greek and Roman sun god sometimes associated with Jesus in the early Christian period.In A.D. 740, an earthquake destroyed the church, which later sank beneath the lakes surface, leaving the ruins submerged and forgotten until they were rediscovered.Profesor Şahin and local government leader Alinur Aktaş have now called for the site to be established as Turkeys first underwater archaeological museum.If the plans for the underwater museum are approved, construction could begin this year and it would open to visitors in 2019, Professor Şahin said.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Good. Then let’s proceed, in an open-minded fashion, with X Factor, the focus group years, where there are some new faces on the panel.We’ve got Louis “lad” Tomlinson, who brings the experience of taking part in the show.Robbie Williams, who brings the ­experience of over 20 years in the music industry.And Ayda, who brings the ­experience of playing Angela Moroni in Days Of Our Lives.Ironically, though, the newest face of all probably belongs to Simon Cowell, whose head now requires constant fanning and is so curiously swollen they could shove it on a plinth in the FA Museum above a plaque that reads: “1923 Cup Final ­football.”What caused it to balloon, I cannot say for sure, but if it was done to divert attention from the other end of the judging panel, he’s seriously underestimated the attention-seeking and self-absorption of Robbie Williams, which is total.A factor not helped by the adoring presence of Ayda, whose public displays of affection for “Rob” could quickly become the X Factor’s most nauseating ever detail.Enormous as it is, there’s not much Simon’s head can do about the singing either.The problem here, of course, is that almost everyone who wants to audition for a karaoke show has now auditioned, or sung professionally.So we were swamped with re-treads on this weekend’s double-header.Among them were: Danny Tetley, who appeared on Pop Idol, Caribbean ­talent show ­veteran Olatunji Yearwood, who’s already got a record deal, Livin’ Joy’s Janice “Dreamer” Robinson, and Brendan ­Murray from Hometown, a Sony act who were managed by Louis Walsh. Not that anyone was admitting as much.If there was any joy and spontaneity to proceedings, though, it was generally ­provided by those random whack-nut contestants who don’t appear on Simon’s approved list.Acts like Livia and the Elementals, Aaron Denham, who looked like he’d absconded from Guantanamo Bay, and Andy Hofton, who performed a song called Castle Of Love that’s been 20 years in gestation and, to no tune at all, went like this.“All my life, I’ve been building a castle of love. That lifts me to your heart.“Here I am, I’ve built my castle of . . .”“Andy! ANDY!” Simon’s hand of objection went up. He was then asked if he had a second song. Angels kicked in and I think you know what happened next.If someone on the judging panel had their wits about them, obviously, they’d have waited for Andy and Robbie to finish their duet then said: “Actually, let’s try Castle Of Love again.”No chance of that, though, as Cowell set his stall out, day one, when he told Danny Tetley: “The music business should be more open-minded.”The irony of a show that’s spent 14 series steering viewers towards its preferred winner now demanding open-mindedness won’t be lost on anyone, but I think it’s just ­cosmetic.The sort of “let’s-pretend we’re-nice” ­cobblers political parties trot out when they’re in as much trouble as this show.It won’t work, though. ’Cos there were so many things the X Factor urgently needed to ditch — sob stories, manipulation, product-placement, deception, scripted “spontaneity” — yet it sounds like the only element it’s going to discard is the brutal and funny honesty which made it stand out from the competition.Show’s over, folks.Paul Merson: “The one person I feel sorry for is the Newcastle fans.”And Tony Cottee: “Hemed’s had two efforts, Freeman’s had two efforts and all three have been saved.”CELEBRITY Big Brother viewers finally got to see last week why the show paid £75,000 to book actress Roxanne Pallett, whose relationship with the truth could, at best, be described as flexible.Unwitting victim was Corrie’s Ryan Thomas, who engaged her with a spot of the house craze for shadow boxing on Thursday’s show, which everyone could see was entirely playful.Having initially laughed it off, though, Roxanne suddenly decided it was “an assault” and he was “a woman beater”, who had to be removed.It made a mockery of the real thing, obviously, and would have ruined Ryan’s life if there’d been a hint of doubt about the video footage.In the kangaroo court atmosphere of the #MeToo movement, however, and with a £75,000 investment to protect, Channel 5 had to indulge her fantasies and give Ryan an official warning for his “behaviour”.She’s since fled the house, of course, without her fee, and apologised.If anyone’s missing Roxanne’s histrionics, though, there’ll soon be another chance to see the dingbat lose her s**t on Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where her stay comes to a tearful climax over the camp fire which, apparently, sparks fevered memories of a teenage house inferno that could’ve killed her entire family. But didn’t.It’s a pattern likely to continue as well.Given the fact then that reality television clearly causes Roxanne Pallett such huge emotional distress and painful memory spasms, it’s probably best if neither she nor the toxic show that booked her ever troubles us again.BBC2’s Eight Go Rallying, in ­CambodiaBBC1’s Bodyguard is a curse, a liability, a Jonah. Norman bloody Wisdom in a bullet-proof vest.He sits on a train, ­suicide bombers appear in the next carriage.He gets in a car with the Home Secretary, a sniper’s killed Terry the driver.He turns up to see her speak? KABOOM! The front three rows of the ­theatre suddenly explode.Where Sergeant David Budd goes, trouble ­immediately follows.And still no one at MI5 or Scotland Yard has made the connection.Mind you, it took the best brains at the Met several days to work out the sniper, who had a shot on him like Yul Brynner in The Magnificent Seven, “might be ex-Forces”.Yeah, well, it’s not a bad theory, I suppose, though you couldn’t rule out the possibility they’ll haul in David Blunkett for questioning next week, as this lot all seem to have trained with Walford CID, the world’s stupidest police force.It’s just one of several reasons why I’m still not buying into Bodyguard.The others being, its idiotic levels of political correctness, the stilted performance of Richard Madden as Budd, and his entirelyunbelievable relationship with Keeley Hawes’ Julia Montague.Mind you, she did conjure up an even more far-fetched and disturbing possibility on Sunday night when she told him: “Sex with the Home Secretary, it’s a heinous crime.”Sex with the Shadow Home Secretary.

Northern Ireland\u0027s devolved legislature in Belfast has not sat since early last year in a row over identity issues like the Irish language, which has prevented the appointment of ministers. Repeated negotiations convened by the British and Irish governments have failed to persuade former coalition partners the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein to reconcile their differences. Mrs Bradley told Parliament: While Assembly members continue to perform valuable constituency functions, it is clear that during any such interim period they will not be performing the full range of their legislative functions.  So, in parallel, I will take the steps necessary to reduce Assembly members\u0027 salaries in line with the recommendations made by Trevor Reaney.

Karen Bradley had no idea the country’s nationalists did not vote for unionist parties in elections. Ms Bradley was given the job earlier this year, in a reshuffle that saw her moved from the Culture department. But she today admitted that at the time she did not fathom some of the deep-rooted issues which define Northern Irish politics.  Ms Bradley also used the interview to slap down Brexit backers - including Boris Johnson - who claim the border issue is being used for a lack of progress in Brexit talks.  She told The House magazine: I didn\u0027t understand things like when elections are fought for example in Northern Ireland - people who are nationalists don\u0027t vote for unionist parties and vice-versa.  So, the parties fight for election within their own community. Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities. Jenny Chapman, Labour\u0027s Shadow Brexit Minister said: This is embarrassing from the Northern Ireland Secretary.  Given this worrying lack of basic knowledge about Northern Ireland\u0027s history, it\u0027s no wonder the Tories don\u0027t seem to understand the vital importance of preventing a return of a hard border there. Ms Bradley was appointed in January after her predecessor James Brokenshire stepped aside for medical reasons. She continued: That\u0027s a very different world from the world I came from, where in Staffordshire Moorlands I was fighting a Labour-held seat as a Conservative politician and I was trying to put forward why you would want to switch from voting Labour to voting Conservative. That is so incredibly different and it\u0027s when you realise that, and you see that, that you can then start to understand some of the things that the politicians say and some of the rhetoric.

The seven-month-old pup gained the most votes in a public or pawblic poll for the Westminster Dog of the Year. Mike Amesbury, who is Labour MP for Weaver Vale, and shadow minister for employment was chuffed to have topped the pawblic poll with the canine Corbyn. The Kennel Club organises the annual event, which this year was raising awareness of how fireworks can affect dogs. Some MPs brought their own dogs to compete but others appeared alongside rescue dogs to promote adopting a pet. Only Labour and Conservative MPs took part this year with Labour topping both the public poll and the judges\u0027 pick. The overall winner or winners of the prestigious award of Westminster Dog of the Year was Alex Norris MP with border collies Boomer and Corona. Winner of the Pawblic Vote - Corbyn and Mike Amesbury  Corbyn the Cockapoo was named by Mike Amesbury\u0027s son after his dad won his Weaver Vale. He said: My son was 7 at the time and it was an election promise by my wife who told him \u0027if your dad wins the election we\u0027ll get a puppy\u0027. Amesbury ousted the Tory incumbent in a shock win. I think it surprised Amanda I won the election and I\u0027m a politician that lived up to his promise, he said. Ted named his dog Corbyn, he loves the White Stripes theme tune as well as well as the fact that his dad\u0027s a Labour MP as well. Mike was persuaded to enter the competition by his Labour colleague Tracey Brabin who won the competition with her dog Rocky last year. He said: Obviously you\u0027re highlighting very important issues, I\u0027ve only been in Parliament a short period of time, but I\u0027ve campaigned on dog shock collars and we\u0027ve been working together across the political parties.  We\u0027re a nation of animal lovers, especially dogs and constituents often get in touch to highlight issues. We\u0027re shipping ious breeds, valuable breeds into this country, so it\u0027ll be clamping down on that.  This year\u0027s theme is strengthening regulation around fireworks as it\u0027s a very distressing time for dogs and pets in general. We want to encourage people to go to organised displays instead. Westminster Dog of the Year - Alex Norris with Boomer and Corona  Alex Norris told the Mirror that Corona is terrified of fireworks. The MP for Nottingham North has a special fire proof covering over his letter box in case people try to post burning material through his door.   He said that one year he and the family had gone out to a display. When they returned he said: The fire proof bag is by its nature an indestructible thing. Corona had absolutely obliterated the thing and normally he\u0027s a very placid dog. 2nd Place  Andrew Mitchell proudly showed off his Welsh Springer Spaniel Scarlet. She is six years old and the former Government whip described her as a loyal dog who loves cuddles and kisses and gives her paw if she wants more strokes. 3rd Place Dame Cheryl Gillian and Gooseberry Cheryl Gillian struggled to persuade Gooseberry of the merits of jumping over the obstacle course. She said she entered with a Dogs Trust Rescue dog because sadly I do not have a dog of my own at the momen and every dog deserves a good home. Dame Cheryl is trying to raise awareness of puppy farming and unscrupulous breeding. Sue Hayman and Greyhound Hugo who is a Dogs Trust Rescue Dog  Sue told us she had left her own dog at home in her Workington seat in Cumbria because it was too far for him to travel. Hugo is a two-year-old greyhound who has been retired from racing and is looking for a new home. The shadow DEFRA secretary said: I\u0027m here today to support the work Dogs Trust is doing - fantastic work because there are so many dogs who need help and support - need new forever homes. It would be lovely if Hugo could find somewhere because he\u0027s absolutely gorgeous and he\u0027s been so well behaved, she said. He\u0027s done some jumps with me and we\u0027ve been through the slalom, he\u0027s done everything I asked of him - he couldn\u0027t have done any better.   Anna Turley and her Shih Tzu Clem  The MP for Redcar was proudly showing off her Shih Tzu Clem who was named after Labour leader Clement Attlee. Anna Turley said she was also there in memory of Baby, a bulldog who was severely abused by two of her constituents and her campaign to change the sentencing for animal cruelty. We\u0027re raising awareness for the campaign I\u0027ve been running for the last couple of years on animal cruelty and to increase the sentencing from six months to five years. I had a terrible case in my constituency of Baby the bulldog - a dog who was abused, thrown down the stairs stamped on - ultimately had to be put down and the guys filmed themselves laughing while they abused the dog. And they got away with just a small fine and an electronic tag. I looked into it and I realised the legislation hadn\u0027t been changed since 1911, which was originally about flogging dead horses on the street.  It certainly wasn\u0027t meant for something so horrendous as something as this case. So I\u0027ve been campaigning, I had a private members\u0027 bill last year, pressured the Government and was delighted when Michael Gove announced last year he was going to increase the animal sentencing t five years but here we are a year on still waiting for it come through. Jo Platt with Lurcher Pam who is a Dogs Trust Rescue Dog  Jo Platt, who is MP for Leigh, did not want to say goodbye to Pam after spending the day with the beautiful Lurcher who is currently living at the Dogs Trust in Basildon, Essex. Pam was adopted by a family who had two pugs and when the dogs didn\u0027t get on - they decided to let Pam go. Ms Platt said: They\u0027re associated with needing a lot of exercise but they\u0027re fantastic family dogs they\u0027re so loving and they\u0027re crossed with collies Lurchers so they\u0027re really, really clever dogs. Ms Platt is campaigning for greater regulation at rescue centres and animal sanctuaries. Environment Secretary and Muffin were a no show  Labour\u0027s Anna Turley was disappointed as she wanted to bend his ear about speeding up the changes to sentences for animal cruelty.

And doctors were even more flabbergasted when little Willow Flather-Paziuk arrived into the world in the position of a ‘ready-to-eat counter chicken’. The flexible tot had her legs flung forward and feet beside her shoulders puzzling mum Lily Paziuk, 20, who now believes she has a mini gymnast on her hands. “I had no idea babies could be born like that, said Lily, from Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire. I thought her feet were back to front at first and wondered what was going on.  Doting mum Lily has even affectionately dubbed her daughter ‘little chicken’ because of the position’s hilarious likeness to a cooked chicken. Thankfully Willow, now one month old, was unharmed and has returned her legs to a more normal position over the course of three weeks. However, she still prefers to sleep with her legs by her sides with her ankles by her shoulders in a split to rival an experienced gymnast. Her mum was delighted when an ultrasound confirmed that Willow’s hips were fine and undamaged by the surprising position. Lily said: “We call her little chicken because she still puts her legs out to the side all the time, even in the position she sleeps in. She does just look like a little chicken.  “Because I had her by caesarean, I didn’t see her straight away so I had no idea. “The doctors were shocked. I was quite out of it but I do remember they were all quite shocked. “I could hear them all talking about it but I didn’t know what they were on about. They were all calling her a little gymnast. “When I got back on the ward all the midwives were laughing that they couldn’t get her feet in the baby grow. “It was definitely a big surprise for me to see her. I went to change her nappy for the first time and they just sprung out. I was like ‘oh my god’. “It was like the elephant in the room because I had loads of visitors come and see us and her legs would spill out and no one dared ask about it.  “It’ll definitely be a joke as she grows older. I’ll never let her forget it. She added: “I think she’ll be very flexible. She can still get back into that position even now. “When I go to change her nappy sometimes she flings her legs back into that position. She remembers it very well.” Lily believes her baby, who was born 7lb 8oz, might have become trapped in the strange position after she ran out of room in the womb to move her legs down. Although Willow was in a normal position at her 15 week scan, Lily had been told at every scan after that her daughter had her hands over her face. The mum has since realised that it was Willow’s feet covering her face – and can even spot it in her scan photos.  But Lily was terrified that moving her newborn’s legs might hurt her and was disappointed she couldn’t dress her up in any of the new babygrows she had bought for her arrival. Lily said: “I felt bad because I spent a fortune on all these little baby clothes and she couldn’t wear any of them. She could only wear vests because her legs wouldn’t go in anything. “She bent her knees the day after, but they were up at her side for about three weeks. “I struggled to hold her and couldn’t change her nappy. I didn’t even know where to begin.

Next week, to mark the anniversary, some ‘Lehman Brothers and Sisters’ are having a reunion cocktail and canapes party. Which is a funny way of remembering the moment they brought down a decade of vicious austerity onto the heads of those who did nothing to cause the crash and could least afford to pay for it. As the campaign 10 Years On puts it – “the banks got bailed out to the tune of \u0026pound130 billion of our money, while we got sold out by austerity”. So, next week, we’re marking the 10-year anniversary with our own events – celebrating not bankers’ greed but the extraordinary spirit of the people who have spent a decade fighting back.  The ‘ordinary’ people who have run food banks and soup kitchens, supported family and friends, and resisted welfare cuts, insecure jobs and stagnant wages. Our events – on Sunday at Sunshine House Community Centre in Wigan and on Tuesday at the People’s History Museum in Manchester – will tell the stories of the people who were the collateral damage, through our Wigan Pier Project. Cleaners, nurses, lollipop ladies. Disabled and elderly people. Warehouse workers, fast food servers. Everyday people. Our Wigan Pier journey – inspired by George Orwell’s expedition eight decades ago through the Depression-hit Midlands and North – began in January 2017 when we set off from a cold Birmingham back street where a homeless man had died overnight. The last 20 months have been an extraordinary experience for me and colleagues Claire Donnelly and Andy Stenning – recorded at wiganpierproject.  We have spent months chatting to people in doorways, homeless shelters, food banks, community centres, bus stops and in their freezing, damp homes. I’ll never forget the man sobbing with bandaged arms  in the Portakabin food bank in  Staffordshire.  Or Rita Culshaw, the former ‘pit brow lass’, whose job it was as a young girl to sort coal from dirt. Or taking veteran campaigner Harry Leslie Smith back to the slum in Barnsley where he lived after his dad lost his job down the pit.  The people we’ve met are literally my Real Britain. Generous, kind, warm-hearted people who share what little they have. People who volunteer with kids, support newly arrived refugees, spend hours sorting food bank shelves or drive elderly people to the doctors. People like the wonderful staff and volunteers at Wigan’s Sunshine House. We started out with a copy of Orwell’s Road to Wigan Pier, now held together with Sellotape, determined to try to live up to that great writer’s capacity for empathy and insight. But also to do some things he wasn’t able to in 1936. To let people speak directly through video and first-person stories in their own voice. And, also, to try to forge a relationship with Wigan itself, a town that has felt itself in the shadow of that book all these years. After we set out, my dad told me that his granddad – another George – had apparently come from Wigan, but almost nothing was known about his life before he ended up in North Wales where his daughter, my nainie, was born.

The suburban street is one long road split into two ends - where the wealthy Wentworth Road meets the more down at heel Aldrich Road. The developer who built the road and the estate in 1934 put a wall keep them apart - and even put spikes on the top. Following a row with Oxford City Council the wall was taken down 60 years ago in Sunnymead, Cutteslowe, Oxon. But now a stark reminder of the haves and have-nots appeared on the road - as workers repaired only the posh end of the street in gleaming black tarmac.  They left the other half untouched - and the dividing line is where the wall once stood. Now a vandal armed with a spray can added their own addition - the words ‘class war’ sprayed in block capitals in bright blue paint. Naomi Langlais, who lives on the working class side of the street, said: It was around April or May time that they decided the \u0027middle class\u0027 side deserved to be resurfaced. So we waited patiently for our end to be resurfaced too and thought it was just taking time as they had run out of money or something. But we soon realised it was just the one end they were doing, apparently we should put up with potholes and uneven surfacing.  She said neighbours had long joked about ‘class war’ on the street, and attributed the graffiti to what she perceived to be differing treatment from the highways team. Ms Langlais added: We have not moved on at all - now we have a visual divide but much less obvious one. The mum-of-four added: It is just so weird it stops at the exact spot that used to occupy the wall, half way down the road. The resurfacing is desperately needed on our end as well. “It does make you feel second class and it is no longer a council estate, people have paid a lot of money for houses this end.    A plaque now sits on the house which neighboured the wall, and reads: “Here stood one of the two Cutteslowe Walls erected 1934 and finally demolished on March 9, 1959.”  Oxford City Council said the only reason that its services company only resurfaced one side of the divide was that the two streets – Wentworth and Aldrich – are still classed as separate roads. A spokesman for the city council said: Oxford Direct Services resurfaced Wentworth Road earlier this year.

Sadie Bristow was on a family day out at Whitstable Castle in Kent, when she told parents Stewart and Clare that she wasn\u0027t feeling well on August 19. Her parents rushed her to a medical centre in Whitstable and she was taken to the the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Margate in a critical condition before being airlifted to St George\u0027s Hospital in London. The nine-year-old - who had gone into anaphylactic shock, caused by an allergy to dairy products - however, died the following day. Writing online, her parents said that Sadie, a pupil at Chartham Primary School in Chatham, near Canterbury in Kent - died on August 20 and that her ‘infectious smile’ would be missed by all who knew her.  Dad Stewart, 45, who teaches tennis at the King\u0027s School Recreation Centre in Canterbury and the Bridge Tennis Club in Bridge, Kent - where Sadie played - wrote on a Just Giving page set up in Sadie\u0027s name : “Sadie was an inspiration and we wish to carry on inspiring in her name. “Sadie, at the end of the 2018 summer season, was ranked no1 UK under 9 girl. “Her passion, drive and determination got her there and we will do all we can in the same spirit to set up a charitable organisation or foundation in her name. “To carry on with her passion in tennis. To aid allergy understanding, research and prevention. “We will update as soon as we know what direction everything will take. If anyone has any advice, can offer any assistance please do contact us. “Thank you ever so much to everyone. The donations so generously given here will help us hugely and we are so ever grateful for the support and love that is giving us courage.  It will help immensely for us to get back together. All our love, Stewart, Clare, Charlotte and April xx. So far \u0026pound17,000 has been raised of an initial target of just \u0026pound1,000. Speaking to the Kent Messenger newspaper this week, Mr Bristow - who also has two other children, Charlotte, 11, and April, just one - said: She was just playing outside when she came in and told us she wasn\u0027t well. We decided she needed to go to hospital and took her to the Estuary View Medical Centre in Whitstable because it was a the quickest and from there she went to Margate Hospital and then St George\u0027s. Anaphylactic shock shuts down the airways very quickly and she did not respond to treatment with 16 shots of adrenaline, which is the first course of action. It is very rare and I think even the doctors we\u0027re taken aback by the speed of it. Sadie\u0027s funeral took place last week. The youngster won more than 40 regional and county tournaments last year, and was being fast-tracked by the Lawn Tennis Association.  The JustGiving website set up to raise money for the family - which has already raised more than \u0026pound17,000 in donations - stated that Sadie was \u0027taken too early\u0027. It pays tribute to the youngster, stating: “The world lost an amazing young girl on Monday 20th August. Sadie Bristow tragically died as a result of a severe allergic reaction. “In her short life she lived to the max at all times. Her infectious smile and lovable nature will be missed by so many.” Stewart, Clare, Charlotte, April and their family are devastated at this terrible time. Stewart spent so many hours on the tennis court with Sadie. She was equally competent by his side on the ski slopes. It\u0027s going to be hard for him to return to those same tennis courts and carry on.

International netball player Catherine Roberts was travelling around New Zealand when she started suffering from headaches. She then went to see a doctor - and a scan revealed a lump on her brain. Catherine\u0027s mum - also called Catherine - flew out to New Zealand to join her daughter and they flew back to Britain together. But on her return doctors told her she was too ill for treatment, and tragically Catherine died just two weeks after landing back in the UK.  Catherine was with her fianc\u0026eacutee Bryony Powell, also 27, and believed she had an iron deficiency when she began to suffer from headaches. Heartbroken Bryony said: She was very healthy and active so it was not normal for her to have a headache. They thought she was low on iron then a few days later we were on a bike ride and she became really confused. That was the first major sign that something was wrong.” Catherine, of Blackwood, South Wales, had played netball for Wales - and was described as fit and healthy when she set off on the dream trip. Catherine underwent surgery in New Zealand but was told she suffered from glioblastoma - an extremely aggressive form of brain cancer.  Bryony said: Where the tumour was located is the personality part of the brain and while in New Zealand she hadn’t cried, and she was quite an emotional person. She just said it was because she was having a great time, in hindsight that was the only symptom she had. Catherine was fit and healthy, the symptoms were things that people wouldn’t necessarily checked. She was tired, had headaches, confusion and a slight change in personality. Bryony wants people to now get checked as soon as they notice a change in their own symptoms.  She said: It’s really hard to process what happened and to be without her every day. The family is just devastated, we all are. We are trying to get each other through. It was tough. She was such a positive person, we never thought the worst would happen. We got engaged and we were inseparable. It is really hard to be without her.  Friends have now launched a netball tournament in memory of Catherine, of Blackwood, South Wales, which will raise money for The Brain Tumour Charity. Together with other friends they have raised more than \u0026pound3,000 in Catherine\u0027s name since she died in May. Tournament organiser Vicki Randall said: We wanted to something for her and she would have liked a tournament.

John Drummond and his wife, Sarah, were told to expect the worst after their beloved little boy, Ted, was struck down with e-coli on a family holiday. Doctors said the 18-month-old, who was already battling leukaemia, was unlikely to be strong enough to fight the potentially-lethal combination. Warned he was about to die, the heartbroken parents were told to kiss their son goodbye - with medics believing he could have just 10 minutes to live.  John, from Basildon, Essex, recalled: Ted started going downhill quickly because the e-coli turned into sepsis , which obviously is lethal. A team of doctors and nurses were trying to put needles into his legs, his arms, his neck. It was two o\u0027clock in the morning and the doctor told us: \u0027You\u0027ve got to leave the room, we\u0027re going to put him into a medically induced coma. Kiss him on the head, he\u0027s got 10 minutes left\u0027. Fortunately, after fighting for his life through the night, the brave little boy pulled through - but his battle with cancer was far from over. He spent two years in and out of hospital battling leukaemia. He had to endure more than 600 days in isolation and four blocks of intensive chemotherapy before eventually being given the all-clear.  Now aged 10, Ted is an ambassador for Beads of Courage, a programme set up by his family and funded by Children with Cancer UK from next year. The scheme helps children fighting the disease by giving them beads specifically coloured to mark each treatment, tablet and procedure. Ted was originally diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  at just six months old following a series of trips to the doctor\u0027s. John said: About two to three months before him being diagnosed we noticed his development was regressing. We were told it was an ear infection, or a bug, or a virus, or growing pains - or even that he was just attention seeking. After his parents sought a second opinion, Ted was diagnosed with ALL, which has a 50 per cent mortality rate in infants.  But his condition took a turn for the worse at 18 months when he was hit by e-coli while the family were holidaying in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. After two days Ted started getting ill, John recalled. We took him to the hospital and he had a rash and was getting really red. John and Sarah were told their son had e-coli. He ended up at London\u0027s Great Ormond Street Hospital, joined by his worried parents, but thankfully pulled through his ordeal. However, despite later being given the all-clear from cancer, Ted had to endure further treatments throughout his childhood. Only now has he been downgraded to a yearly check-up. Speaking of how Beads for Courage helped Ted, John said: The beads are how Ted tells people the story of his childhood oncology.  For every blood transfusion you get a red bead. You get a white bead that relates to chemotherapy. Ted has 600 lime beads for isolation, and hundreds of black beads - one for every time he had a needle stuck into him. The Beads of Courage programme is a phenomenal positive reinforcement tool. They don\u0027t just look pretty, they serve a really good purpose. And the amount of hope and support they give to children is immeasurable. We pinch ourselves sometimes and ask why this wasn\u0027t here 20 years ago? We would have benefited from it. But it\u0027s here now, and every child in the UK who has got cancer has now got that access.

Meghan Markle dazzled in a bright blue dress, flowing to below her knees and teamed with stilettos of the same colour for the 100 Days to Peace gala music evening.  Holding a clutch, the former actress walked alongside Prince Harry, dressed in a navy suit with an olive green tie as they arrived at Central Hall Westminster, London.  Presented by the Royal Armouries, the one-off concert is an evening of music and reflection in aid of three charities Help for Heroes, Combat Stress and Heads Together. During the intermission, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will meet some of the performers during a reception in the Presidents Room. The royals will also meet with representatives from the three charities, and the Royal Armouries\u0027 Trustees and Sponsors.  During the concert, Sir Karl Jenkins, one of the most performed living composers in the world, will conduct his internationally-acclaimed \u0027The Armed Man: A Mass for Peace\u0027.

Combat Stress offers therapeutic and clinical community and residential treatment to former members of the British Armed Forces who are suffering from a range of mental health conditions. Heads Together is a mental health initiative spearheaded by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and The Duke of Sussex which combines a campaign to tackle stigma and change the conversation on mental health with fundraising for a series of innovative new mental health services.  The concert tonight comes after Meghan and Harry, who married in May, were among the star-studded guest list for the annual WellChild Awards on Tuesday evening. The couple dressed to impress and both wore suits for the glittering occasion at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London. They celebrated the inspiring qualities of some of the country\u0027s seriously ill young people and the dedication of those who go the extra mile to keep children healthy and happy. At the event, Harry presented an award and gave a heartwarming speech.

Footage shows Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Bochirov strolling through the town moments after they allegedly tried to murder former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia by spraying Novichok of their doorknob. The pair walk past Dauwalders collectables and stamp store before stopping to look in the window. Both are dressed in winter coats with Perov sporting a backpack and black woolly hat while Boshirov is wearing a baseball cap and a dark jacket.  They can be seen chatting about the wares in the window and try to enter the store before realising it\u0027s closed. After being unable to go into the shop, they then make their way to the train station and head to London. Paul Dauwalder, who owns the shop, told Mail Online : They seemed quite bungling, to be honest. The coins aren\u0027t the valuable ones, we wouldn\u0027t keep them in the window. It was a Sunday and they had just attempted a murder, but they still tried to come in the shop. They were obviously coin fans. They might be murderers but that doesn\u0027t mean they are intellectually dead. From the way they were behaving, they looked like coin enthusiasts or collectors. It seems we even attract Russian murderers.  Their actions in Salisbury almost resulted in the deaths of the Skripals and weeks later caused the hospitalisation of Charlie Rowley and the death of Dawn Sturgess. The Mirror revealed today that the highly trained killers are part of the \u0026shyKremlin’s sinister GRU . British military intelligence sources told the Mirror it is feared Petrov and Bochirov have practised nerve agent attacks for months before the Salisbury operation. We also learned the pair are likely to have been on undercover missions across the West, Europe and Britain several times before they came in March.  The two crack soldiers – recruited from the Red Army and trained for years to gather \u0026shyintelligence on enemy forces and launch kill missions – were last night in hiding in Russia. Their commanders are thought to control Russia’s nerve agent stockpile and its nuclear capability, contained in a briefcase carried by military chiefs and President Vladimir Putin. Despite the Kremlin’s denials it is believed the pair – whose names are aliases – will have been hailed heroes after successfully escaping.  One ex-British military \u0026shyintelligence source told the Mirror: “They almost killed Sergei Skripal in an operation in which they did little to hide their movements. “It is a classic GRU operation, not terribly subtle, but bold and it carried a message that says to all of Putin’s enemies, ‘You are not safe anywhere – we will hunt you down and get to you eventually’. “This was a political offensive operation and it is deeply worrying that they didn’t try to hide it. “They have tested our reaction, gambled against Britain having support and got that wrong but they know more about our strengths and weaknesses – so it was a success. There is little doubt the GRU has been practising this method of using nerve agents to kill, among other \u0026shytechniques, in less carefully policed arenas than Britain, like Syria and perhaps even the Ukraine.  “We should be deeply concerned that the GRU appears to have control of Russia’s Novichok supply as well. It could mean the domestic security forces have relinquished control of it.” Intelligence analyst Bruce Jones added: “These two were probably expendable as the operation was almost in plain sight and not without its risks but the GRU were striking against one of their own. “Sergei Skripal, as a former GRU officer, is regarded as a traitor because he spied for MI6 so in some ways this operation was a matter of honour.

The law on lights is simple enough: you must use car headlights from half an hour after sunset until half an hour before sunrise. But there is a surprising exception to this rule. If you\u0027re travelling under 30mph in a brightly-lit area, you don\u0027t legally have to have them on - though you do still need your sidelights. It\u0027s an odd quirk of the law, but is it recommended? It\u0027s generally agreed that using dipped headlights at night is always the best option - making you more visible to other road users as well as improving your view of the road ahead. But if you do choose to use just your sidelights, make sure you don\u0027t fall foul of the rules - or you risk a \u0026pound50 fine. Not a bright idea. Make sure you know the rules  It\u0027s absolutely crucial that, at all times of the year, your car has a full set of working lights.  As well as an MOT failure, driving with a faulty or damaged light could mean a fixed penalty notice, or three points on the driving licence plus a bigger fine if it goes to court .   Since 2011, it\u0027s also been a legal requirement for all new cars sold in the EU to have daytime running lights . The new UK MOT rules mean that cars registered after March 2018 will need to have these working to pass the test.  Research has shown that DRLs are likely to reduce multiple vehicle daytime accidents and fatalities by up to 6% once all vehicles are equipped.   If you don\u0027t have DRLs on your car, then it\u0027s acceptable to leave your sidelights on all the time. Many cars will automatically turn sidelights on if they have an auto mode for lights, they will also switch to dipped lights when its sensor feels it\u0027s dark enough. The law states that you need your dipped headlights on between sunset and sunrise - but there\u0027s no harm turning them on early to improve your visibility to other road users. Check your lights regularly  The best way to do this is with a friend who can confirm that the reverse and brake lights are all working. Alternatively, you can use a reflective surface like a garage door. You can check hazard/indicator lights yourself as well as the running lights and dipped/main beam settings. If you notice a bulb isn\u0027t working, then pop to Halfords - they will select and fit replacement bulbs to your car for a small fee, and there\u0027s no need to book beforehand.  For a more comprehensive check that everything is working as it should, make an appointment online or in-store for a Free Car Check . As well as a bulb check, they\u0027ll also check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up!  Don\u0027t be dazzled  As nights get earlier we all have to contend with headlights dazzling us. Remember that most rearview mirrors these days offer protection from bright lights from behind. On newer cars you\u0027ll often have an auto-dimming mirror - which means you just let it protect you from being distracted by overly-bright lights. If you find yourself struggling to see, you\u0027ll notice an off switch to disable the feature. On older cars it\u0027s common that your rear view mirror will have a small mechanical switch underneath it. Flip that and the mirror will change angle, without adjusting the view you see. This is used to stop you from being dazzled in the same way a modern electric system works.  If your car has an old manual mirror then why not upgrade to an EchoMaster Dynamic Mirror and Reversing Camera Kit  for \u0026pound149. A reversing camera is fitted behind your number plate by a bracket. This rearview mirror also auto-dims, perfect for autumn driving! Halfords will also fit the whole system for \u0026pound75.  Keep your car clean  A dirty car looks bad, but it might also get you in to trouble. The law states that your number plate needs to be clean and visible at all times. You also need to make sure that brake lights are clean and clearly visible.  As well as using a good car cleaner you should also make sure your windscreen and lights are clean. Use a specialist glass cleaning product like Autoglym Car Glass Polish , \u0026pound8. You can pair that with the Demon Car Valet Pack  - priced \u0026pound24.50  to get every part of your car shiny as new.

The train was ridiculously overcrowded with people packed into the aisles and a few passengers had wandered into the first class carriage simply to find a seat or somewhere a little bit more comfortable to stand.

It\u0027s a big week for kids up and down the country as they head back into the classroom for the start of the new school year. Many parents find themselves worrying about their little ones, and if they are doing enough to help them settle in.  Luckily the experts at parenting website BabyCentre have shared some of their wisdom on what parents can do in the next few weeks to make sure they in.   Get into good habits It\u0027s important to get into good habits and a set routine early on in the school year. Your little one won\u0027t do well if they\u0027re tired, so it\u0027s particularly important to make sure bed time is back to normal after the summer holiday excitement. Set the alarm nice and early so you have plenty of time to get ready and there is no rushing around. A good breakfast is so important, so make sure you get something extra yummy on the table. Think about your speech Your child will either be starting to learn to read and write, or they will be building on skills they\u0027ve learned in previous years. Children pick up on what we\u0027re saying, so start thinking about how you\u0027re talking.  Ask questions which require more than a yes or no answer, and try reading a bedtime story at night. You can also try singing, as this will also get your little one thinking about words but in a more fun way. Get them thinking about numbers It\u0027s also worth getting your child thinking about numbers again so they\u0027re ready to jump back into maths and numeracy. The experts at BabyCentre say shops are a great place for this, as you can look at all the different numbers around you - think aisle numbers and prices. You can also try counting things, like toys or things around the house, or playing with the kitchen scale if they\u0027re a bit older. Keep playing! It can be a stressful time for children, especially if they\u0027re in their first year. Children still need to play and to be praised for what they are doing.

Whether it\u0027s a bacon double cheeseburger or the chain\u0027s famous Whopper, there\u0027s a whole host of flame-grilled goodness to choose from. There are also other options available, including fish dishes and healthy salads, but there\u0027s another big section of the menu people often don\u0027t even consider - chicken. Burger King UK\u0027s CEO Alasdair Murdoch admits the chain\u0027s chicken burgers aren\u0027t always such a big hit, so has taken extreme measures to launch its newest sandwich - the Crispy Chicken Burger. The company is offering one lucky person \u0026pound20,000 to be the first person to taste the new addition to the menu.  Yes, you read that correctly, \u0026pound20,000 just to bite into a burger. Even though it sounds too good to be true - the promotion is real  and is just for customers in the UK. Announcing the news, Alasdair said: This might be the most ridiculous thing I\u0027ve ever done. I\u0027m about to offer a real person \u0026pound20,000 to have a bite of a chicken burger. Why? Well think about it.   Right now who would, A, try and find a Burger King , B, actually walk into one, and C, order something that isn\u0027t beef, isn\u0027t flame-grilled, and isn\u0027t spelt Whopper.  We weren\u0027t born yesterday. We know full well about our checkered chicken past. So we had no other option. We\u0027re going to pay 20,000 to have the first bite of the Crispy Chicken Burger. We need you. Desperately.

The approach of October means that shops are gearing up to get out their Halloween-themed stock, with some starting on the fun a little early. One such store has recently revealed a new Halloween product for 2018, but it hasn\u0027t gone down very well with shoppers on social media.   French beauty chain Sephora are selling a \u0027Starter kit for witches\u0027 which contains a pack of tarot cards, a sage stick, a rose quartz crystal and a selection of perfumes.  And while some Sephora fans have gone wild for the product, others are furious and have even gone as far as to accuse the brand of cultural appropriation.  Twitter users shared their outrage over the brand capitalising on the Wiccan religion .  One said: Sephora is selling witch kits to white girls who see it as a trend when in reality witchcraft was started by Africans and native americans. It seriously just makes me sad how people are using other people’s religions / cultures as a bandwagon to sell for Halloween.  Another commented: Great! These will be bought by people who watched AHS once and called themselves witches while people who have studied the craft and actually know their s*** close up their Sephora accounts. Sad!  A third wrote: How hard is it for people to grasp.  Wicca is a legitimate religion like Christianity. It\u0027s not a joke so I don\u0027t get why  Sephora thinks that a Witches Starter Kit is remotely okay to sell? Where\u0027s the Christian Starter Kit or the Jewish Starter Kit?  Even singer SZA jumped on the bandwagon and warned people not to buy the kit. She said: This whole over the counter tarot cards x Sephora starter witch kit dangerous es hell and very headass .. don’t do magic at the mall kids.    However not everyone saw a problem with the product, some people thought the uproar was fake. The outrage about white capitalism and Sephora selling witch kits with White Sage is actually kind of funny because the internet has BEEN heavily saturated with white girls selling \u0027witchy\u0027 items, including sage. Now that Sephora jumped in, everyone’s fake angry, commented one person. Another posted: I don’t understand girls, how are you gunna be mad @ Sephora for selling witch kits when you’re selling the same stuff on your ~spooky~ etsy shop? The witches making a stink about the Sephora kit on twitter aren\u0027t actually mad about the appropriation of a thing that has roots in many different cultures anyway but are actually mad that something they like is getting popular and they\u0027ll be like other girls again, said a third.

Rolf Buchholz now has an astonishing 516 modifications, and even plans to add more, having had his first aged 50. He is among the weird and wonderful recordbreakers to feature in the latest Guinness Book of World Records, which is published today. The 59-year-old, from Dortmund in Germany, said he “started with tattoos and piercings, and added: I liked it and I did more and more.” And he continued: “It is so great to be in the book. It is something special. I am very proud to be in the book.” He has the most body modifications of any man in the world, according to the records. Other unusual entries in the book include... Most fire-breathing backflips in one minute  Ryan Luney, 22, learned to do backflips when he was eight, but has since added an extreme element of danger to his craft. And he earned a place in the records by completing 14 backflips in just 60 seconds. A statement from Guinness World Records said: Ryan Luney first learned how to fire breathe after being approached to perform in a show in Belfast. The show had trained fire breathers who taught Luney the basics of the skill. Luney then bough the necessary materials and regularly practiced his skills. Soon after, Luney was searching for his next world record attempt. He decided on doing the most fire breathing backflips in one minute after seeing someone do a single fire breathing backflip on TV. He figured this record would combine his two talents: fire breathing and parkour. World\u0027s oldest performing trapeze artist  Also making the list was Betty Goedhart, who at 84 became the world\u0027s oldest performing flying trapeze artist. A statement said: From a young age, Betty has always believed that she could accomplish anything with hard work and determination – which is why she began trapeze classes at the age of 78. Fastest speed in a jet-propelled go-kart  And Brit Tom Bagnall, 26, achieved the fastest speed in a jet-propelled go-kart, reaching a terrifying 112.29mph. Highest jump by a dog  A dog named Feather, from Maryland in the US, set a new record for the highest jump by a canine - by leaping 191.7cm, hitting her basement ceiling. Owner Samantha Valle, 31, who adopted her from a rescue centre, said: “Sometimes it takes a certain person to come along and see the potential in a dog to make them even greater. Most double-Dutch style skips by a dog    Another record-breaking pet is Geronimo, a female Border Collie and Kelpie cross, who has set the record for most double Dutch-style skips by a dog in one minute, achieving an incredible 128. She was proving difficult to train, according to her owner, until she had a go on a skipping rope. Oldest professional club DJ  And at 83 years, 188 days, Sumiko Iwamuro is the oldest professional club DJ. Performing as DJ Sumirock, the restaurant owner said she loves “doing something totally different is energising”. Longest knitting needles created  Another Brit to make the book is artist Elizabeth Bond, who created 4.4metre knitting needles for an exhibition. After learning she has set a world record, the 31-year-old, from Wiltshire, said: “Everybody has potential if you just keep striving and pushing forward. Give it a go, what’s the worst that can happen?” Largest rideable hexapod robot  And Matt Denton, from Winchester, now holds a record for creating the world\u0027s largest rideable hexapod robot, which is 2.8m tall and 5m wide. Matt, 45, spent his childhood avidly watching the Star Wars film, and achieved a dream as an animatronic control system specialist, when he got to work on fan favourite character BB-8 for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

Sinead McNamara is reported to have phoned her mum Kylie to tell her about an incident with another crew member on board the Mayan Queen IV when it was docked on the Greek island of Kefalonia. The 20-year-old also spoke to her brother Jake during her last phone call on Friday. The family’s lawyer Charalampos Triantafyllopoulos is reported to have said: The family expects the Greek authorities to respond to the causes and circumstances of her death and incidents that occurred just prior.  The deceased had telephoned her mother and brother shortly before the unfortunate incident under investigation. She was crying and referred to an incident that took place on the yacht with another crew member. The family state that Sinead was not having any problems, she often communicated with them and she was happy. In two days she will return to her family and her friends in Australia. The parents believe it crucial to thoroughly investigate both the events and incidents that preceded the death of their 20-year-old daughter.  In addition, they are looking for the reasons for the long delay between the time of the unfortunate incident and Sinead’s transfer to an Athens hospital. She had been unconscious for several hours in a comatose condition and every minute was critical to her life. Expressing their trust in the Greek authorities, they hope that the critical issues above will be thoroughly explored and that they will receive appropriate answers for the sudden and unexpected death of their daughter.” Before her emotional phone call it is though Sinead had been happy and enjoying her work as a stewardess on the superyacht owned by Mexican billionaire Albert Bailleres.  He was not on board when Sinead was found seriously injured in the back of the boat. Her mother and sister, Lauren Carr, were en route to Kefalonia from their home in Australia when she died.  They had been due to meet her the following day - as she died on the last day of her work - and are believed to have been informed of the news of her death while in transit. A doctor on board the yacht is understood to have tried to resuscitate her before she was taken to a hospital in Argostoli.

His brother, 35-year-old construction worker Ahmed Abdulkarim al-Shahad, added: “Military preparations as we have seen are in full swing ... We as civilians have started preparing the caves.” Around 3 million people live in the rebel stronghold in northwest Syria. Russia, Assad’s ally, resumed air strikes against insurgents in Idlib on Tuesday following weeks of bombardment and shelling by pro-Syrian government forces. It is feared they could soon launch a full-scale offensive against the last major rebel enclave.

We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United. The 28-year-old always wants on the ball and his eagerness to get forward has made him a fans’ favourite.Pavol SafrankoThe loan signing from Aalborg marked his debut with an excellent goal in the win at Queen of the South and has looked the part since.

They don’t understand how difficult it is to go to places like Alloa and do what you usually do.“Looking at the pitch, compared to Tannadice it’s completely different altogether, so you have to adjust your game.

It’s just the way the game was,” he added.“I’m sure at home it will be a completely different game but we weren’t used to the conditions and the width of the pitch, so it was tough.“I thought we deserved a point. I don’t think we deserved to win the game and fair play to them because they gave everything they’ve got.“We went to Alloa knowing it was not going to be easy. We didn’t underestimate them but they just played their game very well.“Even in midfield I drop in to get the ball and we mostly look like a back three.“We couldn’t do that against Alloa because it would give them a chance to press us and we were unable to do that.“That was one way in which we were affected in the way we like to play but I’m sure a lot of teams will go there and struggle to play their game.”Barton was honest in his assessment of the performance and says United’s players are not used to a more physical game but insists he knows they’ll need to get used to it.“It turned into a bit of a scrap. We don’t set up to play that kind of football and we don’t have the players who do that.“A lot of people would say you need to be able to adapt to most games but even the best players in the world don’t do the scrappy side of things. It’s just the way it is.“It’s in your nature, you can’t work on the physical side on the training pitch, you can work on being organised and having a better structure but you can’t go into training and work on aggression.“It just doesn’t happen and if you’re an aggressive person, great – if you’re not then you’re not.“You can’t wake up one day and say ‘I’m going to be aggressive’.“We’re not bothered about the play-offs, we want to win the league and we need to go to Alloa and win.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"poll results dundee fans give clear verdict on whether neil mccann should stay as manager","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fans have given a clear message to the board regarding the future of manager Neil McCann.The Tele yesterday ran an online poll asking fans if McCann deserves more time to turn things round after at Dens a terrible start to the season.His position as Dundee manager is coming under increased scrutiny after his side lost for the fifth match running on Saturday.The Dark Blues went down 3-1 at home to Motherwell – and it could have been a lot worse.The Dee sit bottom of the table without a point and have twice been beaten by lower league opposition in the Betfred Cup.McCann is correct when he says his team had a similarly bad opening to last season’s campaign before recovering to finish safely in ninth place.However, less than one in five supporters shared his optimism as 80% of Dundee fans who voted in our online poll called for him to be dismissed after 17 months in the hot seat.Of the 1,609 votes submitted, 1,297 believed his time was up.One of our readers wrote: \u0026#8220His tactics and player recruitment have not been good enough.\u0026#8220There is no passion in his players, they were second best against a Motherwell side who chased and harried for everything throughout the match.\u0026#8220He should do the gentlemanly thing and resign and realise he is a better pundit than a manager.\u0026#8221Just 312 people felt he deserved more time.One wrote: \u0026#8220He is still a rookie and there are worse teams in the league.\u0026#8221McCann has time to regroup his players during the international break before a trip to Rangers, one of his former clubs, a week on Saturday.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b45cc3d57c90-e1531308229935.jpg ","title":"revealed these are the men dundee fans want in charge if neil mccann leaves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee supporters have revealed who they want to take over if Neil McCann leaves the club.Five straight defeats at the start of the season have heaped pressure on the current incumbent of the Dens Park hot seat.The Dee are slumped at the foot of the Premier League table and with a trip to McCann\u0026#8217s former employers Rangers next up, on September 15, there are concerns the club could soon become entrenched in the drop zone.A Tele online poll revealed yesterday that 80% of surveyed fans wanted McCann to leave.In the same survey we asked who supporters would want to take over in the event of McCann\u0026#8217s departure, and the voting was tight.Of the 186 people who suggested a new manager, the most preferred candidate was Robbie Neilson, with 28 votes. 100vw, 643px\" /The 38-year-old, who made 21 appearances for Dundee United in 2011-12, led Hearts from the Championship to the Europa League in the space of two years before leaving for MK Dons in November 2016.

The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0027 deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0027 the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group. He is a highly intelligent man, who has lots more to give.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 8:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117291.jpg","title":"Inverness legends and history comes to life through new plaques and digital app","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe artwork on the plaques acts as a trigger for an app which uses augmented reality to bring a story to life using technology.The eighth and final plaque was installed on the Falcon Square statue.

But Cllr Gowans added: \u0026ldquoInverness schools are one of the biggest budget pressures we\u0026rsquore going to face. The last estimated cost to resolve the issue would be something like \u0026pound200 million.\u0026ldquoThat would affect every single service within this council \u0026ndash not just Inverness. But they\u0026rsquove been restricted to Inverness members.\u0026ldquoI cannot fathom why such important issues as Inverness schools, and the implications that has for the resources of Highland Council, are not being brought forward in an open, transparent way in the chamber so they can be discussed.\u0026ldquoThat way, we could reassure communities that this matter is being addressed.Ross and Cromarty area committee chairwoman Fiona Robertson, an independent councillor, did not join the chorus but, speaking after the committee meeting, said: \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to the allocation of the grant, then all councillors need to be involved at a much earlier stage.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 8:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

He impressed and held his starting spot for the 1-1 draw at Hibs.That form was recognised by Scotland U21 boss Scot Gemmill who has called the Pittodrie Youth Academy graduate into the squad that will face Andorra tonight in a Uefa European Championship qualifier tie.Ross said: “I don’t think I was ready then when I scored against Rangers.“I needed that loan move to Morton to get me ready – and now I am.“I am ready to play for Aberdeen.“I learned a lot of stuff about myself mentally while at Morton.“In terms of position, I learned a lot and defensively I also learned so much.“When you are at a huge club like Aberdeen and get an opportunity you have to go out and grab it and I aim to do that.”Ross was a late call-up into the Scotland U21 squad as replacement for Pittodrie team-mate Scott Wright, who had to withdraw having suffered ankle ligament damage during training.Midfielder Ross has previously been capped at U19 and U17 level.While on loan at Morton he made 18 appearances and scored twice.He said: “When I came back from the loan at Morton the manager  said I was so close to playing in his team. What he said made me really work on my fitness over the summer and I came back from pre-season flying and extremely fit.“He noticed that and has rewarded me with game time. That has given me a real incentive.“The gaffer is extremely good with the young players.”Scotland also face the Netherlands in Doetinchem on Tuesday in a Group 4 clash.Gemmill’s young Scots sit fourth in group 4, eight points behind leaders England and three behind second-placed Netherlands, who occupy the play-off position.He said: “You keep an eye on every squad, praying you will be selected.“I know a few of the boys and I was delighted when I got the call-up.”Ross is in the U21 squad alongside fellow Don Lewis Ferguson. Ferguson, 19, arrived at Pittodrie in the summer and has made an immediate impact. The teen has started every game this season and netted a sensational overhead kick in the 3-1 extra-time loss to Burnley in the Europa League. Ross said: “Lewis Ferguson is a year younger than me and when you see him play you think, ‘I need to get a move on here’.”While Ferguson was signed from Hamilton, Ross is part of a Pittodrie Youth Academy class that includes Scotland cap Scott McKenna, Bruce Anderson and Scott Wright.Aberdeen recently rejected a £7 million bid from Aston Villa for McKenna and also knocked back a £3.5m move from Celtic.Ross said: “It is great to have Scott McKenna, Bruce Anderson, Scott Wright and myself out on the pitch. I have been at Aberdeen since I was seven years old and I played my first games for the U10s at that age.“I then actually signed when I was eight. My family were all proud when I made my debut.“There would have been myself, Scott, Bruce, Connor McLennan, Dean Campbell, Sam Roscoe in the U20s. There are a lot more good young players in the U20s that, given a chance, can do well.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

A glass pane at Belleisle pro Richard Gordon’s shop was smashed in the 4am raid. Titleist and Wilson clubs were taken, in addition to Richard’s Ping bag and clubs. Police told the pro there’s been around 25 similar thefts in Scotland since April. And they are working with the Scottish Professional Golfers’ Association to track down raiders. “It’s absolutely gut-wrenching,” said Richard, 45. “The bag and clubs were presented to me in April in Phoenix, Arizona,” he said. The pro was given the accolade of being named Ping Custom Fitter of the Year for Scotland. His precious set of clubs includes a titanium driver, along with a three-wood, hybrid clubs, a full set of irons and a putter. All are high-end, high-value clubs - as are the other makes taken in the raid. Richard and his staff moved into the new South Ayrshire Council shop facility around two-and-a-half years ago. “It’s fully alarmed, and has CCTV cameras,” he said. “Security is excellent, but these raiders are prepared to go to any lengths.” It’s been reported, in other raids, that thieves have smashed through metal shutters, and even brick walls. The pro shop at Dundonald Links, between Troon and Irvine, was also targeted in a recent raid. Richard praised the way the police are conducting their inquiries. “They’ve been highly forensic in their investigation - even trying to get DNA,” he said. “The CCTV shows hooded figures, but it’s something the police are still looking at,” he added. Richard has been associated with Belleisle for 25 years, and has been head pro for 11 years. Richard’s wife Vikki works with him in the business, and Lee Hughes is his assistant pro. Richard said: “I love Belleisle, and it’s great that South Ayrshire has invested so much in municipal golf facilities.” “I think South Ayrshire runs the best municipal golf course in Britain if you exclude St Andrews.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilSt AndrewsTroonDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13191066.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_290818CHAMPION_11JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds flock welcome back inspirational","story":"NewsHundreds flock to welcome back inspirational world record breakerPupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet14:05, 4 SEP 2018NewsKyle Academy pupil Gavin Drysdale \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds of people flocked to a school to welcome back an inspirational hero. Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport could used free","story":"NewsPrestwick Airport could be used as free parking base for ScotRail passengers on Ayr to Glasgow Central lineGovernment officials have pledged to examine the possibility of using the airport - which they own - for free parking relief to help ease the pain of commuters.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:08, 6 SEP 2018NewsPrestwick Airport could be used for free parking \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrestwick Airport could be used as an unlikely saviour in the ongoing crisis at Ayr Railway Station. Government bosses are examining a plan to utilise the flight hub - which they own - for free parking. A number of services on the Ayr to Glasgow Central line will start and terminate at Prestwick Town from next Monday. But with concerns over a lack of parking in the town, transport chiefs have begun scrambling for other options. Ayr MSP, John Scott, led calls for the move to be considered during First Minister\u0027s Questions today in Holyrood. After raising the issue with Nicola Sturgeon, he told the Ayrshire Post: This is now a crisis situation and we should be looking at all available options. Parking in Prestwick is at a premium as it is, so if the airport can provide free spaces until this situation is resolved, it is something we should look at. Responding to Mr Scott\u0027s idea in parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: It strikes me as a very good suggestion and I can\u0027t think of any immediate objection anyone would have. We know the pressure this is putting on commuters. The First Minister has pledged to explore the option with her officials. Four carriage services will continue to operate between Ayr and Glasgow, but six carriage trains will be halted at Prestwick as part of ScotRail\u0027s plan to combat overcrowding on the line. It comes as crisis engulfs Ayr station with the crumbling overhead hotel, owned by a private Malaysian businessman, subject to a large exclusion zone.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnNicola SturgeonPrestwick AirportScotrailGlasgowAyrTransportAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"opposition-urge-sbcs-fragile-ruling-group-to-focus","story":"THE leader of the opposition has hit out at SBC\u0026rsquos administration \u0026ndash claiming they are more preoccupied with infighting than managing the council\u0026rsquos affairs.\nTweeddale East Councillor Stuart Bell  launched the attack after two elected members, Watson McAteer and Stuart Marshall, were \u0026ldquokicked out of the ruling group last Tuesday.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoI am deeply worried at the fragile state of the current Scottish Borders Council administration, and they are hardly 18 months old.\n\u0026ldquoThe executive committee was in turmoil last Tuesday as a result of a clumsy decision to expel one of their own councillors [Watson McAteer] and remove him from that committee.\n\u0026ldquoThe administration\u0026rsquos executive had on their agenda a number of significant and quite worrying financial reports.\n\u0026ldquoBut because this council\u0026rsquos collapsing administration seem to be more pre-occupied with in-fighting than with managing the council\u0026rsquos affairs, these important reports were given scant attention.\nAnd Cllr Bell, who chairs the scrutiny committee, says he will support an initiative of Councillor Clair Ramage  to \u0026lsquocall-in\u0026rsquo the report on the quarterly monitoring of the council\u0026rsquos revenue budget which was discussed on Tuesday.\nHe added: \u0026ldquoLast Tuesday\u0026rsquos executive had before them a report stating that just four months into the financial year officers are projecting \u0026lsquopressures in excess of budget\u0026rsquo of \u0026pound1.36m and that report added that less than a quarter of the savings being identified can be delivered on a permanent basis in line with the council\u0026rsquos financial plan.\n\u0026ldquoThe council executive has a responsibility, on behalf of the public, to scrutinise officers\u0026rsquo reports and actions, but they were too busy infighting to do this on Tuesday.\nBut leader Shona Haslam  hit back at the claims.

collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh

indentured servants for the sugar industry.\nSince then, descendants of Scots can be found living across Barbados \u0026ndash sharing Scottish surnames like McCluskie, and even last names such as

For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents. However I brought in my bill establishing dog control notices as a way of intervening before a dog bites or attacks and becomes dangerous.\n\u0026ldquoOnce a dog control notice is issued, the council will regularly check up to ensure it\u0026rsquos being followed.\n\u0026ldquoI would encourage anyone concerned about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour whether in public, in its garden or indeed any other private place to get in touch with the council. This is in the interests of the public, the owner and indeed the dog itself.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-post-office-finds-new-home-in-market-square","story":"MELROSE post office has finally found a new home.\nThe town\u0027s postmaster, John Collins, was hoping to retire at the end of last year.\nBut plans to relocate the provision to Abbey Mill in Annay Road were abandoned earlier this year following objections from the local community.\nNow it has been confirmed the post office will move into the Masons of Melrose bookshop in Market Square.\nThe move will see the branch open from 9.30am until 5pm, Monday to Saturday.\nA six-week public consultation has been launched by post office bosses to gauge public opinion.\nClive Semple, post office area network change manager said: \u0026ldquoWe are making it easier for customers to get their cash, send and collect their mail and do their banking because we know how important these services are to local residents.\n\"We are confident that this vibrant new-style post office at the heart of the local community will meet customer needs.\"\nDuring the public consultation, the company will welcome feedback on any issues customers would like considered before the move.\nThe consultation will close on October, 4.\nPeople can share their views at \nhttp:postofficeviews\n\u0026nbspwith the branch code 113830.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"cycle-event-road-closures-wont-prevent-happy-couple-tying-the-knot","story":"A BRIDE-TO-BE will get to the church on time -

said demolition was the only economically viable option left.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThe building is not physically incapable of repair, therefore the overriding principle that needs to be satisfied is one of economic viability.\n\u0026ldquoThis application is supported by feasibility reports and valuations which estimate the building is beyond the point of economic repair.\n\u0026ldquoVarious

scheme for a development which would retain the front facade of the church and the spire was also evaluated, and this would potentially result in a loss of around \u0026pound1m.\n\u0026ldquoThe

that the applicant has demonstrated that a substantial and likely inappropriate development would be required to make the scheme viable.\n\u0026ldquoI am satisfied that the viability argument has been

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service return.\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of life, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots. It was answered and delivered by these two brave and ambitious local ladies, who with the community at heart, saved Innerleithen\u0026rsquos Post Office.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"photos-group-of-flamingo-chicks-hatch-in-oxton","story":"A GROUP of flamingo chicks have hatched at a Borders conservation centre.\nNews of the arrival of the Chilean flamingo flock was confirmed by Bird Gardens Scotland.\nThe newborns\u0026nbspwill form part of a new visitor attraction in Oxton, near Lauder.\nThe chicks hatched from eggs laid by the established Chilean flamingo flock at Chester Zoo.\nThe flock at Chester had a breeding success earlier in the summer, leading to a number of surplus eggs.\nThe eggs in question were incubated by the Bird Section in Chester prior to being carefully transported to Bird Gardens Scotland in Oxton, to hatch.\nIts not been confirmed how many chicks there are.\nFollowing on from hatching, the eggs will take 30 days to develop into healthy flamingo chicks, also known as flaminglings.\nMark Haillay of Bird Gardens Scotland said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos an incredible moment when you first hear a flamingo egg grunt at you and you know that within 48 hours there will be a chick asleep, resting after its epic journey from inside the egg out into the world.\nLike many other types of bird, flaminglings have an egg-tooth on the tip of their beak which they use to gradually scratch and chip away at the shell creating an opening large enough for them to wriggle free of the shell and out into the world.\nThe flaminglings will be hand reared in Oxton, fed every two hours round the clock with a specialist liquidised diet fed through a syringe.\nThis mimics the beak-to-beak feeding which would occur in parent reared birds parent flamingos produce a rich saliva  and dribble this into the chick\u0026rsquos beak providing all the water, nutrients and energy they need to grow and stay healthy.\nMark added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos incredibly exciting to think these little balls of grey fluff will grow to be majestic flamingos.

is encouraging those working within the industry to make safety a priority.FSPS, which consists of key industry stakeholders, will focus on different types of farming activities, each quarter, to deliver key messages and encourage those working and living on Scotland’s farms and crofts to take action.This week, the campaign, trailing on from Farm Safety Week in July, is urging people to make an active choice about their safety and will focus on the following between September and November: general maintenance on farm, falls from heights and safety at harvest.Last year there were 33 deaths in the agricultural industry in the UK, with five in Scotland.The most common causes of death in the agricultural industry continues to involve falls, transport, animals and equipment.Over the last five years 38 people have been killed in the UK by a moving vehicle 12 people have been killed by contact with machinery 10 have been killed by asphyxiation or drowning, including in grain stores or pits and slurry pits and eight people have been killed by contact with electricity.This data does not take into account the number of injuries on Scotland’s farms and crofts, a number that is believed to be significantly higher.For those amidst harvest, it is essential that they practice the ‘Safe Stop’ method when working with machinery, equipment and vehicles \u0026#8211 handbrake on, controls in neutral, engine off, keys out.Anyone working with equipment or machinery should also be appropriately trained, with full risk assessments carried out, particularly when working near power lines.Speaking on behalf of FSPS, NFU Scotland chief executive Scott Walker commented: \u0026#8216One death or injury on Scotland’s farms and crofts is frankly one too many and as an industry we need to take action to make a conscious effort to put our safety, and that of those living and working around us as a priority.\u0026#8216Whether it is carrying out maintenance to a roof, checking over a machine, or working in a field with power lines, injuries and deaths through accidents most of the time are preventable by taking simple steps and precautions.\u0026#8216This campaign encourages farmers and crofters to make a point of ensuring their working environment is safe, to help us work together to reduce the death and injury toll on our farms and crofts.\u0026#8216This autumn, it is about your Safety, your Choice, and as the darker nights draw in, and many are rushing to get the job done it is important to take a step back to make sure you are working

Both present geological challenges but they can be overcome.\u0026#8216Today, I\u0026#8217ve asked for a feasibility study to look at these issues and move things forward.\u0026#8217In February, the Courier compared a potential bridge from Kintyre to Northern Ireland, to the Øresund bridge, which connects Copenhagen in Denmark with Malmo in Sweden.Professor Dunlop drew on this comparison during his speech, referencing the fact that the Øresund bridge links two separate countries, each with their own distinct identifies but sharing a cultural heritage, similar to Scotland and Northern Ireland.He pointed out the political benefits of linking the two UK countries, especially post-Brexit.He believes a bridge may re-balance the concentration of power held by Westminster and be an investment in what he considers to be the true north.Argyll and Bute MSP, Michael Russell, said of the plans: \u0026#8216A bridge, together with better road links to the central belt, would open up Argyll in a dramatic new way.\u0026#8216I would be keen to see public bodies investigate the feasibility of such a link.\u0026#8217The Øresund bridge, linking Denmark and Sweden, could be similar to a structure linking Kintyre with Northern Ireland.

awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said

One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially involving someone from Argyll.\u0026#8217The exhibition, which was launched in Oban in July, will be in Campbeltown until September 29, before moving on

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"hearing-to-take-place-on-substation-plans-at-former-cockenzie-power-station","story":"  Scottish Ministers called in the planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd  earlier this year before East Lothian Council had been given a chance to make a decision on the proposal.  ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.

The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant.

The event is being held ahead of the submission of a series of applications, enacting the existing planning permission for the mixed-use development.  The site is located around Longniddry Farm, to the south of the vilage\u0026rsquos railway line, and follows the approval by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee of 450 new homes at the site last August, with formal planning permission in principle issued in June.  The initial plans were approved despite concerns that the new development could split the village in two.  The development includes about 25 per cent affordable homes plus associated commercial and retail space, community facilities, infrastructure and green space.  The commercial and retail space is being delivered separately by Socially Conscious Capital, acting for landowner, Wemyss and March Estates.  Should permission be received, it is anticipated that construction could start on site early next year.  Fraser Lynes, land and development director for Cruden Homes , said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have the opportunity to take forward the great work carried out by Socially Conscious Capital and Taylor Architecture.  \u0026ldquoOur involvement in this development confirms our commitment to the county and complements our other developments in North Berwick, Aberlady and Dirleton.  \u0026ldquoWe fully believe in the design principles which are embedded in the existing consent and look forward to delivering a truly bespoke product in one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos best locations.  Mark Greaves from ZeroC added: \u0026ldquoOur intention is to do something really special here, creating a beautiful and sustainable exemplar development that looks and feels like the best of Longniddry and East Lothian.  \u0026ldquoWith its close proximity to the railway station, Longniddry South is already set to be one of the most sustainable developments in East Lothian."},{"url":null,"title":"military-exercise-to-take-place-near-north-berwick","story":"  The exercise, run by the Ministry of Defence , takes place between September 3 and 21 at Gin Head, the former Second World War radar site at Tantallon, to the east of the town.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo.

There have previously been reports of vandalism and people breaking into the building.

Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.

She told The House magazine: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot understand things like when elections are fought for example in Northern Ireland \u0026ndash people who are nationalists don\u0026rsquot vote for unionist parties and vice-versa.  \u0026ldquoSo, the parties fight for election within their own community.  \u0026ldquoActually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities.  Ms Bradley was appointed in January after her predecessor James Brokenshire stepped aside for medical reasons.  She continued:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos a very different world from the world I came from, where in Staffordshire Moorlands I was fighting a Labour-held seat as a Conservative politician and I was trying to put forward why you would want to switch from voting Labour to voting Conservative.  \u0026ldquoThat is so incredibly different and it\u0026rsquos when you realise that, and you see that, that you can then start to understand some of the things that the politicians say and some of the rhetoric.  She was interviewed by the weekly magazine for the Houses of Parliament.  Often the battle for seats at election time is between Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour Party  or the Democratic Unionists, Ulster Unionists and smaller unionist parties.  The cross-community Alliance Party has made gains in some areas like Belfast in recent times.  It holds the balance of power between the two communities in Belfast City Council.

Instead of glorious failure, events conspired to send Shelley Kerr and her players to next summer\u0026rsquos World Cup in France.  The final whistle, and the players\u0026rsquo unbridled joy on learning that Switzerland had simultaneously failed to win in Poland, confirmed Kerr\u0026rsquos long-held belief that it would be the top seeds who faltered at the last hurdle.  The win over Albania at the Lori Borici Stadium was somewhat laboured, but neither the head coach Shelley Kerr nor her players were concerned about that after the team\u0026rsquos historic achievement.  The two results left Scotland on top of Group 2 for the only time since the qualifying campaign began last September. They can now look forward to next summer\u0026rsquos finals in France while the Swiss contemplate the four nation play-offs.  \u0026ldquoYou could see our energy was zapped tonight after the win over Switzerland on Thursday night and the pitch here wasn\u0026rsquot great, Kerr said. \u0026ldquoBut that\u0026rsquos why I knew it would be the same for the Swiss against Poland.  \u0026ldquoThe team are going to celebrate for sure because they deserve it \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos not every day you get to a World Cup, is it? Nothing compares to this. I\u0026rsquom delighted for all the players, the organisation and all the other people who support us. We had seven or eight good chances, we\u0026rsquove hit the post again and we should have made it more comfortable but I\u0026rsquom no going to dissect the performance.  \u0026ldquoThe whole week has been so tense and I\u0026rsquove tried to keep calm as a coach. I\u0026rsquove just told the players to try and win the games and they\u0026rsquove done it magnificently.  Top scorer Jane Ross, who was left out of the starting line-up for the previous two games, returned, while Manchester United\u0026rsquos Lizzie Arnot was also given her first start since returning from an ACL injury in April.  Christie Murray and Claire Emslie dropped down to the bench.  With the home side expected to get as many bodies as possible behind the ball, Scotland\u0026rsquos game plan was to stretch them on both flanks and it didn\u0026rsquot take long to pay off. After nine minutes of probing, Lisa Evans got clear on the left and sent over a cross to the far post which Arnot sent back into the paths of Kim Little and Erin Cuthbert. The Arsenal captain claimed it and crashed a volley past Viona Rexhepi.  It looked to be a non-contest as the Scots created chance after chance but they lacked the sharpness to take advantage. Rexhapi was also doing her part and made a terrific double save from Cuthbert and Ross six minutes after the goal.  The pattern continued until the half hour when the Albanians started to find some confidence. They found an equaliser just before half time, and just minutes after Rexhepi had made an even better save from Emma Mitchell \u0026ndash Megi Doci sending a low shot past Lee Alexander, who had been redundant for most of the 45 minutes.  Left-back Mitchell came even closer with a shot which hit the post and Cuthbert drew out another fine save from Rexhepi, but it was starting to look fraught midway through the second half when the much-needed goal finally arrived.  Caroline Weir took a free kick which her Manchester City team-mate headed back into the path of Ross and the striker scored her 57th, and most important, Scotland goal.  After that there was no way back for Albania, who spent most of the remaining time pinned back in their own half.

Perth Sheriff Court was told on Wednesday that the assault conviction was likely to lead to his dismissal from his job driving vulnerable people for the local authority.  Solicitor Jamie Baxter, defending, said: \"He has held employment with Glasgow City Council as a driver for children with special needs for 19 years.  \"As a consequence of this it is likely that his job will be terminated. He is already suspended and subject to an ongoing investigation.\"  Sheriff Gillian Wade, who found McIntosh guilty of assault after a trial, fined him \u0026pound750.  She told him: \"It was a most unfortunate incident to have taken place and you are now suffering the consequences of having a conviction for assault on your record.  \"This will be very much felt by yourself. It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My wife Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me. I thought it was some sort of road rage about something.  \"He was hooting his horn and flashing his lights and my wife woke up. I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened. My wife was frightened.\"  He said the bus pulled out into the oncoming carriageway to overtake but cars appeared travelling towards them and McIntosh swerved the football coach back in.  \"The bus pulled over and hit the rear of my car. I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans returning from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light. After a second or two I came too with my wife screaming.  \"I had a lump on the side of my head which the policeman described as the size of a small egg. I don\u0027t think I could believe it.\"  Mr Wall said he told McIntosh he was calling the police and that prompted him to usher the fans back into the bus and drive off.  McIntosh, Stewart Crescent, Barrhead, was found guilty of assaulting Mr Wall on the A9 by punching him on the head to his injury on 16 April 2017.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8546348.jpg?type=article-full","title":"stahly-quality-food-defends-decision-to-create-the-great-british-haggis","story":"  Stahly Quality Food are\u0026nbspmarketing their signature Scottish food as the \"Great British Haggis\" made with \"the finest British ingredients\".

Other parties are becoming virtuosos in the art of political division. The Conservatives are split at least three ways over Brexit, with their Prime Minister\u0026rsquos authority in ruins and Boris Johnson in open revolt. Labour is bitterly divided over anti-Semitism and Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos leadership. The SNP isn\u0026rsquot: it realises that unity works.  With 125,000 members, the SNP is now the second largest party, not just in Scotland, but in the entire UK. Indeed, if the SNP membership were scaled up to UK level, it would have twice the UK Labour Party membership and 12 times that of the Tories. Such numbers might be expected in a radical opposition party, but not a long-in-the-tooth party of government.  Yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon announced the 12th legislative programme since the SNP entered government in 2007. The SNP is now into its second decade in office, yet support appears actually to be rising again, according to YouGov, and is back to 40 per cent. This despite the widely-publicised problems with NHS waiting lists and poor performance in educational league tables. Nor has support for independence flagged, with one poll this week suggesting that, if Brexit happens, more Scottish voters are minded to support Yes than in 2014.  Ms Sturgeon appears to have seen off the threat from Richard Leonard\u0026rsquos newly-Corbynised Scottish Labour, and we are reliably informed that Ruth Davidson is now looking to a political future in Westminster. Much of this success is down not to the Scottish Government, which has made its share of mistakes, but to the resilience of the party itself. Yesterday\u0026rsquos programme was a workmanlike job with important measures on mental health, animal welfare and children\u0026rsquos rights, but it was essentially an addendum to last year\u0026rsquos offerings on tax and the environment. Everyone says Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos administration is looking tired, and in some respects it is. Truth be told, the Scottish Cabinet, Sturgeon aside, has never looked particularly dynamic. But the slide to political disfavour, widely predicted after 2017\u0026rsquos abortive referendum, hasn\u0026rsquot taken place. The party continues to break all the established rules of politics \u0026ndash the pendulum refuses to swing. This is largely because the SNP membership has turned party unity into an article of faith, and turned positive thinking to a potent political weapon.  It\u0026rsquos not as if the SNP lacks issues to split over. There\u0026rsquos Brexit for a start, upon which there are widely differing views. Some back Brexit, some back a People\u0026rsquos Vote against it, most are dismayed at the prospect and feeling powerless.  Ms Sturgeon can\u0026rsquot make up her mind on whether to support a People\u0026rsquos Vote, but unlike in the other main parties, no vociferous factions have emerged to persuade her either way.  Many SNP activists are desperate for an early independence referendum, and believe that if Nicola Sturgeon doesn\u0026rsquot announce one now, the chance might never come again. We have pro-independence marches wending through Scottish cities almost by the week. But Ms Sturgeon has pointedly declined to endorse them, and has given precious little sign of being about to call a referendum. In any normal party, there\u0026rsquod now be two warring camps, like the Leavers and Remainers of Brexit, on this existential question of independence. But not the SNP. You can almost sense it positioning itself for constructive disappointment, not open revolt. The great split over the referendum may never come.  Then there\u0026rsquos the Sustainable Growth Commission Report,with its dismal science of deficit reduction. That caused much dispute on the Scottish left, but the membership has refused to turn it into any recognisable left-right division in the party. There\u0026rsquos no Campaign for SNP Socialism. The will to unity is just too strong \u0026ndash as it has been in the backwash from the resignation of  Alex Salmond \u0026ndash a veritable god in the Nationalist pantheon, who has been cast out of the party after over 40 years.  The row over Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos crowdfunding took place outside the SNP. Faced with the extraordinary prospect of the former First Minister taking the Scottish Government to court, SNP members refused to turn what they see as a personal drama into a political crisis. Many SNP women have concerns about victims of sexual harassment, and Mr Salmond isn\u0026rsquot universally popular, but they chose not to turn this difficult case into an intra-party gender war.  Labour and press commentators often talk about the SNP\u0026rsquos almost unnatural unity as if it is centrally enforced. As if there is some dictatorial party secretariat imposing rigid discipline and suppressing debate. Either that, or the SNP is a \u0026ldquocult, they say, in which star-crossed believers lose their ability to disagree. In truth, it is neither: the SNP is just damned if it will give the hated \u0026ldquomainstream media stories about splits, so it keeps it in the family.  It wasn\u0026rsquot always so. The SNP used to be notorious for its squabbles and divisions. Mr Salmond was expelled from the party in 1979 for leading a left-wing faction. And the party was deeply divided over devolution in the 1990s. It learned the hard way that unity works. Rather like the Tartan Army, the SNP has found a way to insulate itself emotionally from the disillusion and despondency that afflict most political parties once they starts governing in prose. This is what has prevented the Scottish Government from lapsing into mid-term doldrums and disarray. For its many thousands of members, the SNP has become, not so much a political party, more a way of life."},{"url":null,"title":"may-and-corbyn-clash-over-second-brexit-vote-at-prime-ministers-questions","story":"  The Prime Minister said she was clear that Britain would leave the European Union on March 29 2019.

When ministers announced the literacy and numeracy assessments for pupils in P1, P4, P7 and S3 they said the should replace existing tests.  However, teachers who responded to a survey by the Educational Institute of Scotland  said at least eight of Scotland 32 local authorities were continuing with previous standardised assessments - although it is unclear how long this will remain the case.  The EIS warned the practice of \"double-testing\" increases teacher workload and puts too much pressure on pupils.  The survey also suggested at least 25 councils had introduced \"blanket testing\" - where all pupils sit the assessments at the same time.  The Scottish Government has previously said teachers should have the freedom to decide when pupils sit the assessments.  An EIS spokeswoman said: \"For these children, assessment was not an integral part of everyday learning and teaching and was not timed to support their individual learning. This was out of the hands of teachers.\"  The latest concerns over testing came on the day John Swinney, the Education Secretary, gave a statement to Scottish Parliament on the purpose of the assessments and whether parents had the right to opt out, which has caused confusion.  Mr Swinney used the statement to apologise to parliament for a \"misleading\" letter on controversial primary school tests sent by a senior civil servant.  The minister said that while he did not personally sign off on the letter from Graeme Logan, a deputy director at the Scottish Government\u0027s learning directorate, he took full responsibility for it.  However, Mr Swinney said he remained committed to the assessments at all levels, despite cross-party opposition and calls to \"cut his losses\" on the issue.  Mr Swinney said: \"I did not sign off the letter that was issued by the deputy director to directors of education, but I take full responsibility for it because I\u0027m a minister in the Scottish Government and it\u0027s right that I take full responsibility for it.  \"I can only apologise to parliament ... for the events that took place in that respect, but I take responsibility for it because I should take responsibility for it.\"  He stressed that the substance of the letter was consistent with the Scottish Government\u0027s position - that while there is no statutory right for parents to withdraw their child from any aspect of schooling other than some parts of religious education, the tests were not compulsory.  Ross Greer, education spokesman for the Scottish Green Party, urged Mr Swinney to \"cut his losses\".  He said: \"In the case of P1 tests it\u0027s quite clear that a majority of this parliament want to see them go and sooner or later that is what we\u0027re going to vote for.\"  Iain Gray, education spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party, added: \"Faced with the evidence of stress on four and five-year-olds caused by these tests, testimony from teachers that they are time-consuming and of little educational worth, and a campaign by parents to boycott them, he is carrying on regardless.  \"In P1, at least, they should be suspended. I believe that\u0027s the view of this parliament and I hope we will have the chance to demonstrate that as soon as possible.\"  Mr Swinney said the assessments in P1 provided an early view of areas of weakness in literacy and numeracy that was vital in closing the attainment gap.

They don\u0027t say that the time she is running now is not as good as what Steve Cram managed in the 80s.\"    He said the fact the Scots team are playing in better teams in some of the biggest women\u0027s football leagues is having an impact.  \"If you look at where the men\u0027s game is, there are very few players in the English Premier League, they are mostly playing in the Championship [the second tier of English football]. But if you look at the women in European terms, they have players at Manchester United and Manchester City and it is playing at that higher level that is no doubt what is propelling them to the World Cup.\"  Alana Watson, who is also an SFSA director said that Shelley Kerr\u0027s Scots team will become role models for the young girls who are increasingly taking up the sport.  \"What they have done is a massive achievement at a time when the men\u0027s team has not qualified for an international tournament in the last 20 years. It shows that the standard of women\u0027s football in this country is going from strength to strength,\" said Ms Watson, who is a former coach.  \"Predominantly football is seen as a man\u0027s game so women are always going to be challenged to be recognised for their accomplishments in that field and with qualifying for the World Cup, that will hopefully change some people\u0027s views about it.  \"The numbers of, especially younger girls, who are involved in playing football and going along to a club and having that structured league that boys grow up with, that has definitely grown massively in the past decade, so for them to have role models who are women, who they can actually watch play football, that is going to inspire them even more.\"  She felt women\u0027s football was attracting those who prefer a more family friendly atmosphere - something they often do not get when attending a Scottish Premiership game.  \"There is less stigma surrounding the women\u0027s game,\" she said. \"That\u0027s why there are a lot of kids that like to go and watch women\u0027s football.\"  Chris Rawlings, Scottish FA\u0027s commercial director said in announcing the BBC Alba deal: \u0026ldquoThis is a partnership we are extremely excited about as the women\u0026rsquos and girls\u0026rsquo game in Scotland continues to develop.  \u0026ldquoHaving a guaranteed broadcast partner allows us to show all the women\u0026rsquos national team home matches which have proven to be an exciting entity.  \u0026ldquoThe record crowd of 4,098 at The Simple Digital Arena in Paisley proves the appetite is there to watch the women\u0026rsquos national team and this deal enables the nation to watch our games, when they can\u0026rsquot make it along to the stadium.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-calls-on-david-mundell-to-take-no-deal-brexit-scenario-off-the-table","story":"  Today, the Scottish Secretary is due to appear before Holyrood\u0026rsquos Finance and Constitution Committee to give evidence on the EU Withdrawal Act, which the Nationalists believe is a \u0026ldquopower-grab, a contention the UK Government strongly denies.  The issue of a no-deal was raised at Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions in the Commons when Jeremy Corbyn seized on remarks by Dominic Raab, who had suggested there were \u0026ldquocountervailing opportunities should no agreement be reached.  After the Labour leader asked Theresa May what these were, the PM replied: \u0026ldquoThis Government is working to ensure that, whatever the outcome of the negotiations, this country makes a success of coming out of the European Union and that we see a global Britain and a brighter future for people here in this country.  Ahead of Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos appearance at Holyrood, the SNP\u0026rsquos Willie Coffey MSP declared: \u0026ldquoThe Tories think they can do what they want to Scotland and get away with it trashing thousands of jobs and costing every person in Scotland the equivalent of \u0026pound2,300 each if we crash out of the EU without a deal.  \u0026ldquoDisgracefully, there are some extreme voices on the right wing of the Tory Party, who are recklessly talking up this possibility. The Tories are already desperate to drag Scotland out of the EU against our will and they now want the worst possible outcome.  \u0026ldquoWith the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan looking dead as a dodo, David Mundell must now rule out a no-deal disaster altogether and back staying in the single market and customs union.  \u0026ldquoHe has a great opportunity to make clear a no-deal outcome is off the table and that he will finally put Scotland\u0026rsquos national interest before internal party division and back membership of the single market and customs union.  The Secretary of State, who has insisted there is no credible alternative to the Chequers Plan, over summer said a no-deal was preferable to a Brexit deal that \u0026ldquothreatens the integrity of the United Kingdom such as the one put forward by the EU on Northern Ireland, which would see a border down the Irish Sea."},{"url":null,"title":"moscow-accuses-uk-of-manipulating-information-after-salisbury-suspects-named-as-russian-spies","story":"  Police and prosecutors said they now had enough evidence to charge Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.  In a hushed Commons chamber, the Prime Minister told MPs investigations had concluded the two men suspected of the \u0026ldquobarbaric attack in March were members of the GRU, Russia\u0027s military intelligence service.  \"It was almost certainly also approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state,\" she declared.  While Mrs May did not explicitly blame the Kremlin for authorising the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal, 67, a former GRU agent, and his daughter Yulia, Tory backbencher Tom Tugendhat said there was \"no doubt it was state ordered and President Putin bears responsibility for a war-like act\".  His Conservative colleague, Dominic Grieve, the former Attorney General, said Britain had become the \u0026ldquovictim of state terrorism by a state, that is run as a gangster organisation.  But Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for Russia\u0026rsquos Foreign Ministry, hit back, claiming the names and photographs of the two suspects \u0026ldquorevealed nothing.  She added: \u0026ldquoOnce again, we ask the British to move from public accusations and manipulating information to practical co-operation via the law enforcement agencies.  In her Commons statement, the PM went through the itinerary of Petrov and Boshirov in the run-up to and in the aftermath of the Salisbury attack, all of which was caught on CCTV cameras.  There was a clear intake of breath in the chamber when she mentioned that traces of the nerve agent Novichok were found in the London hotel room used by the two suspects.  Mrs May told MPs that prosecutors deemed it futile to apply to Moscow for the extradition of the two men as Russia did not allow its citizens to be tried abroad.  But she noted: \u0026ldquoShould either of these individuals ever again travel outside Russia, we will take every possible step to detain them, to extradite them and to bring them to face justice here in the United Kingdom.  A European Arrest Warrant has been obtained and the UK authorities are also seeking the assistance of Interpol.  Ahead of her Commons statement, Mrs May telephoned US President Donald Trump and afterwards spoke to Justin Trudeau, the Canadian premier.  In New York, Britain has called a meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which includes Russia, for today to update members on the progress in the Salisbury investigation."},{"url":null,"title":"politicians-urged-to-get-their-act-together-over-scotlands-stalling-economy","story":"  Research by the David Hume Institute found Scotland has consistently underperformed compared to many other European countries, with its productivity lagging 20 per cent behind Denmark.  It comes as independent forecasters revealed income tax raised \u0026pound550 million less than expected last year, with opposition figures urging the SNP to rethink its \u0026ldquohigh-tax agenda.  Meanwhile, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay announced a consultation on plans to create a Scottish National Investment Bank to boost the economy by investing in businesses that would otherwise struggle.  A new report by the David Hume Institute said there had been \"no progress\" towards a target set by ministers in 2007 to improve Scotland\u0027s productivity rankings to take it into the top-performing 25% of nations in the OECD.  It raised concerns over a lack of employment growth in Scotland\u0026rsquos most productive industries, as well as low business investment and a shrinking working-age population.  Arguing there has been little productivity growth over the last 15 years, it also pointed to slipping standards in schools and underlined the importance of \"first-rate education and training\".  It warned there are \"no quick policy fixes to Scotland\u0027s productivity challenge\".  Researchers said nations which had successfully boosted this key part of economic performance had done so only after a \"concerted effort to get their act together\".  Scottish Labour\u0027s economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the findings laid bare \u0026ldquothe scale of the SNP\u0026rsquos mismanagement of our economy.  The Wealth of the Nation report \u0026ndash produced with support from the Scottish Policy Foundation, which counts former SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson among its advisers \u0026ndash said Scotland is being outperformed by at least half of the OECD.  It also said that while the UK as a whole was \"at the centre of a so-called \u0027productivity puzzle\u0027\" which had seen growth slump to \"virtually zero\", the slowdown had started earlier in Scotland.  It said: \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos productivity over the past fifteen years has remained broadly stagnant and has underperformed compared with many other European countries.  \u0026ldquoWhile Scotland is more productive than most other regions of the UK, this comparison is limited as the UK as a whole has lower productivity than many other advanced economies.  Among UK regions, Scotland is behind only London and the South East for productivity.  Jane-Frances Kelly, director of the David Hume Institute, insisted \u0026ldquopoliticians and policymakers need to get their act together and make choices guided by evidence.  She added: \u0026ldquoFailing to do this will put the Scottish economy at risk.  It comes as the independent Scottish Fiscal Commission said income tax receipts in Scotland were \u0026pound550 million lower than forecast in 2016/17.  The shortfall was largely down to officials overestimating how many people would pay the highest tax rates, it said.  More than a million Scots pay higher income tax than those earning the same elsewhere in the UK under changes ushered through earlier this year.  Scottish Tory shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said the analysis shows \u0026ldquothere are considerably fewer earners on higher and additional rates than the SNP government thought when it was plotting its tax hike.  He added: \u0026ldquoThat means future tax receipts could be badly out, and that will have an impact on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos ability to pay for hospitals schools and infrastructure.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman stressed the shortfall would have \u0026ldquoabsolutely no impact on the Scottish budget or planned spending.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Fiscal Commission forecast the 2016-17 figure based on HMRC survey evidence of the number of Scottish taxpayers.  \u0026ldquoIt was always to be expected that this forecast would differ from outturn data and is why the Scottish budget is protected from any such change.  SNP public finance minister Kate Forbes argued Scotland\u0026rsquos economy is \u0026ldquofundamentally strong, but said the Government will consider the points raised in the David Hume report.  She said: \u0026ldquoOver the last decade, productivity in Scotland has grown at more than three times the rate it has across the UK as a whole, and our productivity growth has been higher than any other country or region of the UK, including London, with productivity increasing by 1.7% in the first quarter of this year.\"  Outlining her legislative programme earlier this week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a Scottish National Investment Bank would be established by 2020.  The Government has committed to providing \u0026pound2 billion over 10 years to fund the publicly-owned bank, which will operate on a commercial basis.  It is thought it will require between 100 and 150 staff, with its annual operation costs pegged at between \u0026pound20 million and \u0026pound30 million."},{"url":null,"title":"david-mundell-says-self-interested-alex-salmond-must-end-appalling-rt-deal","story":"  It was clear the former First Minister\u0026rsquos one guide principle was \u0026ldquoself, he said.  The Scottish Secretary also criticised the former First Minister\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoextraordinary crowdfunded legal action against the Scottish Government over two sexual misconduct complaints.  Mr Salmond raised \u0026pound100,000 in an online appeal within three days to pay for a judicial review at the Court of Session, to challenge the government\u0026rsquos handling of the process.  He denies harassment and criminality.  Speaking to the media at Holyrood between evidence sessions at two committees, Mr Mundell was asked about Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos work for the pro-Putin channel RT.  In the days after the Novichok nerve agent attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March, Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos RT show gave a platform to speakers deflecting blame from the Russian state.  On Wednesday, Theresa May told MPs the poisoning had been carried out by two members of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU  Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquoI think Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos approach to Russian television has been appalling from the start. It was ill-advised.  \u0026ldquoIt certainly didn\u0026rsquot put the interests of Scotland or the United Kingdom to the fore.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos become increasingly clear that Mr Salmond has one guiding principle in his actions, and that\u0026rsquos self.  \u0026ldquoI think he would do Scotland, himself and the whole country a great service if he were to end his programme on Russian TV.  Asked about Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos crowdfunded legal action, Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquoEvery member of the public that I\u0026rsquove spoken to about that issue found it extraordinary that he would take that decision to seek funding from others for a matter that related primarily to himself.  He echoed the recent comments of Rape Crisis Scotland and Zero Tolerance that Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos \u0026pound100,000 appeal could have a wider chilling effect on women being abused.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe problem is that we want people to come forward to challenge figures in authority, figures of power and wealth, and it\u0026rsquos not helpful for them to create a backdrop where people think that those people can bring huge resources to bear to make their case, whilst an ordinary person is not able to do the same.  Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos comments add the pressure on Mr Salmond to quit RT, which he joined last November for a reported \u0026pound250,000 a year.  The Scottish LibDems also urged Mr salmond to quit this week, however he has so far refused to comment on the matter.  His weekly Alex Salmond Show did not address the Salisbury case this morning.  Mr Salmond has been asked for comment on Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos remarks."},{"url":null,"title":"brussels-admits-there-are-some-positive-elements-to-mays-chequers-plan","story":"  The more emollient language came as Tory grandee Lord Tebbit entered the Brexit fray by likening the EU to a \"dictatorship,\" from which Britain had to \"break free\".  As Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, was again in Brussels for more talks with the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, the claim that Mr Barnier had pronounced to MPs at a private meeting that the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopropositions sont mortes,\" was raised with the European Commission.  Its spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, urged people to have patience and wait for the official transcript of Monday\u0027s behind-closed-doors meeting between the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator and the Commons Brexit Committee.  \"Michel Barnier was very clear expressing the Commission position on Chequers from the very first moment,\" declared Mr Schinas.  \"I don\u0027t think that people present in the room and beyond the room have any doubt on what we said on Chequers we identified where there were positive elements and we discussed also the possibility for further discussions to address issues that still create problems.\"  He explained how the private meeting provided \"the perfect recipe for everybody coming out of there and saying what one or the other understood Michel saying\".  Mr Schinas added: \"Let\u0027s wait for the transcript and then let\u0027s check the sort of things that are reported of what Michel Barnier said against what he actually really said.\"  Mr Barnier said today\u0026rsquos meeting with Mr Raab would see the pair continue to work to find \"common ground\" between the European Council\u0027s guidelines and the Chequers Plan with a view to creating a \"new, ambitious partnership\". No post-meeting press conference is planned.  At Westminster, Lord Tebbit told peers that those opposed to Brexit had to get used to the idea \"that the people of this kingdom are well capable of running their own affairs\".  He went on: \"We did it successfully for rather a long time before our friends on the continent got round to the idea [of establishing the EU].  \"We have constantly over the centuries had to come to their rescue against dictatorships which have sprung up on the continent. This is another case of a dictatorship springing up on the continent from which we have to break free,\" declared the former Conservative Chairman.  Lord Callanan, the Brexit Minister, noted: \"I\u0027m delighted to see that in your advancing age, you have lost none of your robustness. I\u0027m not sure I quite share your sentiments exactly. But of course we are committed to Brexit.  \"We want to be a nation that\u0027s, in future, in charge of our own laws, our own borders and our own money. That\u0027s what Brexit is all about. That\u0027s what people voted for and we will deliver,\" he added.  In a separate development, Matt Hancock, the UK Health and Social Care Secretary, said the flow of medicines to UK patients would be \"unhindered\" by a no-deal Brexit with plans to stockpile drugs and fly in supplies of treatments with short shelf lives.  Mr Hancock insisted he was \"confident\" that supplies would continue and said he was working with the pharmaceutical industry to cover the extra costs that the emergency measures could bring.  Failure to reach agreement with the EU on medical regulation and trade could cause disruption to supply chains but Mr Hancock said preparations were being made to cope.  He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that he was \"increasingly confident\" a deal with Brussels would be agreed.  But the Secretary of State stressed: \"It is important, as a responsible Government, to make sure we prepare for all eventualities and therefore we have got to be ready for exiting without a deal. Therefore, we have proposed that there is stockpiling of medicines by the pharmaceutical companies, not by the NHS.\"  He described the firms\u0026rsquo response so far had been \"very good\" and added: \"I am confident that if everybody does what they need to do, then we can have an unhindered flow of medicines even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\"  But the Liberal Democrats\u0026rsquo Tom Brake, a supporter of the People\u0027s Vote campaign, said: \"In just two years, ministers have gone from promising \u0027sunlit uplands\u0027 to admitting that taxpayers may have to foot the bill for stockpiling vital medical supplies. And we haven\u0027t even left yet what nasties are there that they haven\u0027t even spotted yet?  He added: \"This dystopian Brexit Britain is not what anyone voted for in 2016. People wanted a stronger NHS, not a health service on its knees, at risk of running out of medicine, equipment and staff.  \"With the Brexit being delivered now unrecognisable from the one that was promised it\u0027s no wonder that calls are growing for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal.\"  Elsewhere, Andrea Leadsom, the Commons Leader, said UK ministers had \"no plan\" to cancel holiday time for MPs to cope with the Brexit workload.  She sought to play down talk of scrapping recesses despite the need to deal with several pieces of law connected to the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019.  Mrs Leadsom also refused to be drawn on suggestions that the Budget could be delayed until December.  Next week, MPs will debate legislating for the withdrawal agreement, proxy voting and the Salisbury nerve agent attack.  Labour\u0026rsquos Valerie Vaz described the business in the chamber as \"light\" and bemoaned a lack of details on what would be debated next month after the party conference recess.  The Shadow Commons Leader told Mrs Leadsom: \"I don\u0027t know if she heard [Solicitor General Robert Buckland] on August 5 on Westminster Hour he said there\u0027s a fair amount of legislation to get through that we\u0027d have to look at recesses.\"  Ms Vaz asked: \"Could the Leader indicate whether the Government is looking at the possible cancellation of recesses and, if so, which ones because we do need to plan.\"  The Labour frontbencher also warned there was \"chaos\" in the Government, and the whole country is \"dissatisfied\" over its handling of Brexit.  She added: \"Chaos, because we\u0027re now told the Budget may be at a different time. Could the leader confirm reports whether the Budget will be in October or whether, as some Treasury sources have indicated, it will be in December?\"  Mrs Leadsom replied: \"There is no plan to cancel recesses.  \"The business managers are looking carefully at recesses and we are very much on the front foot in organising, for example, the secondary legislation as well as the passage of primary legislation to make sure that we enable all members to have the right amount of scrutiny time in this place, and at the same time have the opportunity to carry out their constituency work and to have a bit of a break from time to time.\"  The Commons Leader said the European Commission needed to \"take very seriously\" Mrs May\u0027s offer on the future UK-EU trading arrangement, adding: \"What the Chequers proposal also does is to meet the red lines of the European Commission.  She also defended the business schedule in the Commons before saying on the Budget: \"That date will be announced by the Treasury in the usual manner, as it always is.\"  The Commons returned from a near-six-week summer recess on September 4, will rise on September 13 until October 9 for party conferences, and will rise again on November 6 until November 12.

Ms Fairbairn delivered the message ahead of the CBI Annual Dinner in Glasgow on Thursday, which the First Minister is also due to attend as a top table guest.  However Ms Fairbairn did agree with Ms Sturgeon on a No Deal Brexit being a \u0026ldquocatastrophe, and urged businesses leaders to take a stand against it.  She said it would be so damaging it should be \u0026ldquosimply not an option.  However Theresa May and her ministers insist it remains on the table if the Chequers proposal for a soft Brexit is rejected out-of-hand by the other 27 EU nations.  Ms Fairbairn said the CBI, which speaks on behalf of 190,000 businesses employing nearly 7m people, would speak out clearly on the \u0026ldquothe catastrophic risks of a no-deal exit.  She is expected to say in her speech: \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos what it would be for Scotland. A catastrophe. \u0026ldquoDelays to just-in-time delivery meaning that Scotland\u0026rsquos food exports would not reach markets in peak condition.

No-deal is just not an option. Not for the UK, not for Scotland, and not for the EU.  Ms Sturgeon has previously said if Scotland is taken out the EU single market and customs union by Brexit, immigration should be devolved to help cope with the impact on EU citizens and workforce shortfalls.  But on immigration, Ms Fairbairn said: \u0026ldquoScotland has a brilliant and talented workforce. But look at the stats, and it\u0026rsquos also a shrinking workforce. Demographics are not in Scotland\u0026rsquos favour.  \u0026ldquoAdd Brexit uncertainty and a brain-drain to the South East and overseas. And you have a potent mix of problems. The skills shortages are biting. Not in the future, not soon. Right now. So last month the CBI called for a new immigration system. A system that earns public trust while allowing business to attract the people they need.  \u0026ldquoA system that\u0026rsquos open but controlled, too. And we are clear it must work for Scotland.  \u0026ldquoSome have asked - do we need a devolved solution for Scotland? It\u0026rsquos a fair question.  \u0026ldquoBut the businesses I\u0026rsquove spoken to say \u0026ldquonot right now. Let\u0026rsquos get it right for the whole UK.  \u0026ldquoThe better the outcome we get, the less need for iation across the UK.  And the less companies need worry about doubled up systems and extra red tape.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who will also be attending the dinner, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom absolutely clear there are no plans to devolve immigration.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot part of the Smith Commission [on more powers], and indeed polling in Scotland suggests the public don\u0026rsquot support the devolving of administration.

In addition, this year we are also looking to recruit more men to the Panel and have a national target of around 200.”                                                                                                        Between April 2017 and March 2018, 32,553 children’s hearings took place supporting 14,076 vulnerable children and young people across Scotland at risk of neglect, abuse or who may be involved in the care system.Whilst children and young people can be referred to the Children’s Reporter for a range of different reasons, recently released statistics show that between April 2017 and March 2018, 85% of the cases referred were on the grounds of care and protection. This is the most common ground for referral for children under the age of one.Boyd added: “Panel Members are required to deal with a range of different cases in children’s hearings. These can often be very complex. We are looking for a diverse range of people who can engage with children and young people, make important and difficult decisions and importantly who can ensure that the rights of the child or young person in each hearing are respected.”The new CHS campaign will run for five weeks until the end of September.

They are a force for good and their role is vital.”The Children’s Panel is a system unique to Scotland and last year saw around 1,500 people apply to become members. There are currently 3,000 volunteers across Scotland dedicating around 360,000 hours each year to the Children’s Hearings system.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo if only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked if they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook.

Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 8:59 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 8:59 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it.

Brian, who was awarded a British Empire Medal in June this year in recognition of his services to military history in Orkney said: “Many people have dedicated time and energy to gathering photos over a period of 20 years or more and would like to see the collection completed as far as possible for the centenary of the Armistice on 11 November this year.“Having a nearly complete set of images of all the Orcadians lost would be a most poignant way for our community to mark this anniversary and a wonderful resource for future generations.”It’s believed 578 Orcadians died serving in the Great War and the Legion’s collection, available to view on their website, contains photos of just over half — 297 — of those lost.The council’s call comes as part of Orkney’s First World War commemoration programme, which is being coordinated by the council with invaluable contributions and support from local organisations community groups and individuals.As part of a series of events, on November 11, Orkney will participate in a national commemorative event that involves as many photos of local lives lost in the war as can be found and the participation of their families, a further reason for trying to complete the collection.Lucy Gibbon from the council’s Library and Archive service said there may well be much sought-after photos in people’s attics and family memorabilia collections: “Whilst very few people had a camera during the Great War, nearly all towns had photo studios. Most servicemen visited one of these while training in the UK.”“If you know you lost an Orcadian relative in the war, now is a great time to find out more about them. The Orkney Library \u0026amp Archive might have some items to help shed light on their story.”The Legion’s photo archive has been made possible thanks to the generosity and hard work of many — for example around half of the photos have been sourced from The Orcadian, which has published photos sent in by families in a feature called Our Roll of Honour during the Great War.Other notable contributors and donators over the years include Tom Gibson of Rousay, Beatrice Thomson of North Ronaldsay, Mabel Eunson of Deerness and the late Margaret Watters of Stenness, Bill Miller of Stronsay, Phyllis Gee of Flotta, and George Esson who spent two decades visiting families in South Ronaldsay and Burray seeking photos of loved ones lost in the war, and with the help of and David Mackie and Colin Rendall made copies for the Orkney Library and Archive.These and many more contributors are noted on the project’s website — where people can also view images in the collection by Parish and by significant battles.Anyone with photos they believe are not already included in the Legion’s collection is urged to contact Brian Budge on phone 01856 872225 and email brian.budge@btinternet or to drop into the Orkney Library and Archive in Kirkwall.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

With these beach cleans we’re taking that commitment one step further, helping sweep our shorelines for litter and collate vital local data that will be fed back to the Marine Conservation Society.”“The results from previous years’ Great British Beach Cleans are thought to have been instrumental in bringing about environmental legislation such as the plastic bag charge and banning of microplastics in personal care products, so the more local faces that join in, the bigger the potential difference we can all make.”The Great British Beach Clean is organised by the Marine Conservation Society  and takes place annually in September.Scottish Sea Farms are looking for volunteers to take part in their effort.They have asked anyone planning to join in to should register, via https:www.mcsuk.org/beachwatch/events/gbbc, and should wear appropriate clothing with pickers, gloves and bags to be provided.The meeting point of the Echna Loch Bay event, will be at lay-by on the road next to the bay, down the hill from the fossil centre, and the meeting point for the Weyland Bay event will be at the lay-by opposite the sewage treatment works on Carness Road.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There’s that fudgy sweetness that characterises the more mature Highland Park, but here it’s combined with complex aromatic spices as well as dark chocolate orange and floral peat notes.

We\u0026rsquoll ensure an open competition for all bidders whether public or private sector organisations.\u0026ldquoWe expect the current franchise to end in 2025.

He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartThursday 6 Sep 2018 9:00 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The campaign was highlighted earlier this year by the Ross-shire Journal when riders revealed their concerns.After meeting campaigners near Cullicudden, Miss Forbes said: \u0026ldquoIn a rural place like the Black Isle it\u0026rsquos not surprising to see horse riders. Despite that, I was really disappointed to hear that drivers usually drive too close and too fast when passing a horse. There is evidently a lot of work to do in educating drivers about overtaking horses and the serious dangers of scaring horses.\u0026ldquoSadly, horse riders told me that they believe the roads are increasingly dangerous for horse riding, despite horse riders having equal access to the road. I support these horse riders on the Black Isle who want to raise awareness of how to overtake horses and ensure that riders don\u0026rsquot fear for their safety when riding in a rural place like the Black Isle.Since 2010, there have been almost 150 incidents on Scottish roads involving both motorists and horse riders \u0026ndash including two rider fatalities and 50 serious injuries.One local rider earlier told the Ross-shire Journal how she had taken to wearing head-mounted cameras in a bid to protect herself and others. Concern over an increasing number of near misses and alarming incidents has prompted calls to the police to intervene.Nel MacDonald-Rolfe, one of the riders, said: \u0026ldquoRural roads are to be treated with respect even by the locals who become complacent and take chances. You never know what is round the corner nor what can suddenly appear from the side of the roads.\u0026ldquoRural roads are there to be used by all, which includes cycles, walkers and horse riders. Patience and respect for all users and educating is the key. As they say, speed kills.The appeal to drivers to rein in their speed and to be aware of other road users followed near-misses on the B9169 Cullicudden straight. Police say they recognise the vulnerability of horses on roads and encourage motorists and riders to show mutual respect for each other.They say all road users should be able to travel safely and drivers should give horses as much room as possible when passing. They want road users to read the Highway Code for guidance.- Email us at newdesk@spp-groupThursday 6 Sep 2018 9:00 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

That echoes public concerns which prompted a rethink from Highland Council four years ago.Tarbat Community Council is amongst the latest groups backing Craighill, stating that the TRA site \u0026ldquoshould not feature even as a second choice. It has outlined concerns over the lack of space for future expansion, inadequate room to play and the prospect of \u0026ldquotall and ugly buildings more appropriate to terminals at a second-rate airport.It says that \u0026ldquohuge cost advantages could come from using modular building techniques.The new campus will replace Tain Royal Academy, Craighill Primary, Knockbreck and the St Duthus special school. Parent councils have consistently appealed for improved facilities with the existing Craighill building the lowest scoring in the Highlands for educational suitability and condition.Wendy Hennem, of Tain Royal Academy Parent Council, noted that the Craighill site appeared to be the preferred public choice and that the resounding response from young people is: \u0026ldquoJust get it done.Tain and Easter Ross ward councillor Fiona Robertson told the Journal: \u0026ldquoAs we haven\u0026rsquot reached the deadline yet, I am not privy to the results of the consultation. However, I believe from my work with the stakeholder group and from being amongst the communities, that the Craighill site may be the most popular option. This has always been my preferred option as I believe it is much more suitable for a development of the size of a three to 18 campus.\u0026ldquoWhatever the results, it is important that the community works with Highland Council in order to deliver much-needed new schools for Tain. The extremely poor conditions of our primary and secondary schools in Tain is well known and acknowledged by Highland Council, therefore we all need to work hard to prepare an agreed plan in order to be in a position to apply for government funding later in the year.\u0026ldquoI believe the majority of people in Tain and Easter Ross just want to ensure we get fit for purpose schools in Tain to ensure the best possible educational facilities for our children\u0026rsquos futures.Fellow ward councillor Derek Loudon said: \u0026ldquoStudies by the community council, the Highland Council and the Ross-shire Journal have shown a clear preference for Craighill. There is little public support for the TRA site as all three consultations have shown. I hope we can move on now to get a layout on the Craighill site which is along the lines of the study done by Lachie Stewart [chairman of Tain and Easter Ross Civic Trust] and the community council which takes advantage of the space available to deliver great new buildings for primary, secondary, St Duthus, Gaelic and sports and leisure.\u0026ldquoI believe significant savings on cost, quality and time can be made with new construction techniques which are proven and have worked elsewhere.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had a chance to stop the sense of Scottish Government drift in the new Programme for Government, but she blew it, writes Tom Peterkin.                Can a ruling party in Scotland ever have suffered a more anguished summer recess than the one recently endured by the SNP? That – by the way – is a rhetorical question because the answer is a blindingly obvious and resounding “no”.            Of course, the allegations of sexual harassment made against Alex Salmond were responsible for much of that anguish. As was his colossally insensitive “crowd-funding” appeal to fund the legal action he is taking against the Scottish Government.            In contrast to Mr Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon has reacted to this most unfortunate turn of events with a great deal of dignity and professionalism. But that cannot mask the challenges she faces to hold her party together amid talk of SNP splits as Ms Sturgeon is pitted against her predecessor and mentor.Despite his bullish response to the allegations against him and his work for a Kremlin-sponsored broadcaster, Mr Salmond still seems to hold considerable sway within the party. But there is also a big wide world beyond the internal difficulties of the SNP and the personal troubles of Mr Salmond. This is the real world where most people live and it is where the First Minister and her team face a whole host of other problems which require urgent attention.These were apparent during the recess before all political controversies were drowned out by the revelation that two women had made complaints against Mr Salmond. Before the allegations against Salmond broke, education was the dominant theme of the recess with John Swinney under fire over controversial national tests for primary one pupils.            READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon’s Programme for Government – everything you need to knowAnd thrown into that unhappy mix was the controversy over the 700 teaching posts unfilled before the start of term, a decline in pupils taking foreign languages and a narrowing subject choice under Curriculum for Excellence. No wonder that a picture is being painted of low morale in the classroom, a state of affairs that was graphically illustrated when Mr Swinney was accosted by angry teachers on the radio.A litany of complaints were directed at the Deputy First Minister and Education Secretary including workload, low pay and shortages of specialists to deal with children with learning difficulties. With parliament back from its summer break this week, these concerns are being reprised with EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan warning that it would take decades to change the culture of Scottish education.            But Ms Sturgeon’s challenges are not confined to education.When faced with an NHS plagued by bed-blocking, missed waiting targets and doctor shortages, Ms Sturgeon does not have her troubles to seek when it comes to Scotland’s public services.This week, the First Minister was preparing to announce her legislative programme for the next 12 months when the above point was made via a Scottish Government survey, illustrating rising dissatisfaction with public services. Therefore it would have reasonable to expect the First Minister to come out fighting on the return to parliament with a legislative programme to get her administration back on to the front foot.The need to seize the initiative is further underlined when it comes to the economy.             READ MORE: Brexit will mean Scottish independence vote, say SNP MPsToday a report by the much-respected David Hume Institute warns that Scottish productivity has all but stalled for the last 15 years and immediate action is required to turn things about.But when the country needing a Government on the front foot, Ms Sturgeon and her ministers spent the summer devising a back-foot Programme for Government. Consisting of a dozen bills, there were aspects that were commendable – notably the commitment to put mental health counsellors in schools and the announcement to bring forward benefit payments to low-income mothers. But there was precious little else and certainly nothing to drive the sort of radical reform required to sort out Scotland’s public services.In fact much of the discussion when Ms Sturgeon unveiled her proposals at Holyrood on Tuesday was the previous year’s Programme for Government. At the heart of last year’s Programme was Mr Swinney’s much vaunted Education Bill.That was the legislation which was supposed to be the “centrepiece” of Ms Sturgeon’s 2017 plan, offering the “biggest and most radical” change to how schools are run in the lifetime of devolution. It was to be the vehicle to deliver more powers to headteachers – the key to Mr Swinney’s reforms. Since then – as Tory leader Ruth Davidson was only too keen to point out – the Bill has been shelved. Mr Swinney has argued that the changes can be better delivered without legislation, but his climbdown has contributed to the impression of a drifting government.  Tuesday’s programme was an opportunity to arrest that sense of drift. Alas it was a missed opportunity.As the controversies over Alex Salmond linger prominently, one seasoned observer in the Holyrood canteen remarked that there was nothing in the legislative programme to grip the politcal narrative over the coming months. Unless the narrative is to be one of a Scottish Government that has run out of steam."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4795825.1536228827!/image/image.jpg","title":"report scotland s productivity has stalled in past 15 years","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Scottish productivity has all but stalled in the past 15 years and the health of the economy is at risk unless more consensus is built between government, business and unions.                The verdict on Scotland’s economy has been delivered in a report by the David Hume Institute, which says a turnaround is required if living standards are to improve.             The report says Scotland is outperformed on productivity by many other advanced economies.             Scotland sits mid-table for productivity among OECD countries, and falls below other European economies such as the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain.The report’s authors say that if Scotland wanted to move to the top quarter of the table, it would need to become roughly as productive as Denmark.But in 2014, Scotland’s productivity was 20 per cent lower than the Scandinavian country.The report said there had been “no progress” towards a target set by ministers in 2007 to improve Scotland’s productivity rankings to take it into the top-performing 25 per cent of nations in the OECD.The think tank also warned there are “no quick policy fixes to Scotland’s productivity challenge” – saying nations which had successfully boosted this key part of economic performance had done so after a “concerted effort to get their act together”.            The Wealth of the Nation report – produced with support from the Scottish Policy Foundation – said Scotland is being outperformed by at least half of the OECD.Although Scottish Government capital spending has been above the UK average, the report added it still “lagged considerably behind other developed countries” – with government investment in Scotland as a proportion of overall GDP roughly less than half of other OECD nations in 2015.Institute director Jane-Frances Kelly said there needed to be a “turnaround” saying: “We are not the first country to face this challenge but – as our research shows – politicians and policymakers need to get their act together and make choices guided by evidence. Failing to do this will put the Scottish economy at risk.“Our research has looked at London, Manchester, Sweden, Australia and Ireland – and in every case we found that a ruthless focus on evidence, building consensus across the political divide and creating strong institutions were crucial to turn things around.”            While she said attempts at short-term fixes would “only result in this problem being kicked down the road, at the expense of jobs and growth”, Ms Kelly stressed there was “much we can achieve if politicians, policymakers and businesses really turn their minds to it”.Scotland has had higher spending on economic development since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999, the report said, with the budget for it in 2016-17 at just over £1 billion.The think-tank added: “Despite these intentions to boost productivity, no progress has been made on the 2007 target, with Scotland still far away from the top quarter of the most-productive OECD economies.”It described economic productivity in Scotland as being “only middling when compared with other OECD economies”, adding that “despite sustained attempts by successive Scottish governments to raise productivity, there has been little productivity growth in Scotland over the last 15 years”.The report suggested a number of factors for this, citing low economic growth, low business investment and low spending in research and development.            Tory economy spokesman Dean Lockhart said the study was “a vital and timely contribution to the single biggest challenge facing Scotland’s economy – how to get higher wages and create more jobs by making our economy work better”.Public finance minister Kate Forbes said: “Over the last decade, productivity in Scotland has grown at more than three times the rate it has across the UK as a whole and our productivity growth has been higher than any other country or region of the UK, including London, with productivity increasing by 1.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year.“Scotland’s economy is fundamentally strong but we are determined to strengthen it further and will consider the points raised in this report.”She added that  Brexit was the single biggest threat to Scotland’s economy."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4796137.1536246927!/image/image.jpg","title":"trans woman says bank froze her account because she sounded like a man","story":"        A transgender woman has said her bank account was frozen after call-handlers identified her as a man.                Sophia Reis said she was left “embarrassed” and had a nervous breakdown at work after she failed a security check on August 30.            The 46-year-old customer service adviser described the experience with Santander Bank as “the last straw” after claiming she had been discriminated against on a number of occasions in the past.            She said she had informed the bank in November last year that she would like to change her name from Sergio to Sophia.But the bank froze her account as she failed to pass a security check, which meant she was not allowed to transfer £72 to a friend on her debit card.Miss Reis told the Press Association this was not the first time she had faced difficulties - with shops banning her from entering at certain times because they did not want people “complaining that you are here”.READ MORE: ‘Confusion’ over transgender guidanceShe claimed she had applied for more than 400 jobs in the space of eight weeks and had attended countless interviews but had no luck until her last interview - which she attended as a man.            Describing what happened when she complained to Santander, Miss Reis, of Carlton, Nottingham, said: “I went into the bank in Clumber Street and said, ‘You have got all my documentation and I changed my name on November 11.’“They said my voice did not match my profile because it sounded like a man on the phone and not a woman.“I was crying my eyes out and I am not that type of person at all. I am a very courteous person and I am outgoing but to feel that way when all I asked was for my money to be transferred - I feel mistreated.”READ MORE: Comment: Transgender politics is a minefield            Miss Reis, originally from Portugal, moved to England in September 1997 as a single parent with her three-year-old son.She told the Press Association: “I’ve told people this is the last straw that broke the camel’s back.“In my previous job, my employer had a problem with who I am and then in the eight weeks I was unemployed, I applied for over 400 jobs - something like 50 to 70 a day.“I had countless interviews and would never get the job - and then my last interview I went as a man and I got the job, and that’s where I work now.”Speaking of how she felt when her card was declined in Tesco, Miss Reis said: “You can imagine the embarrassment. I was almost in tears and I was absolutely fuming.            “They eventually managed to unblock my card so I returned to work - I had a nervous breakdown at work and I was shaking like a leaf.“For the first time in my life I felt embarrassed of who I am.”A spokeswoman for Santander said: “We have apologised to Miss Reis for the experience she had when using our telephone banking service and offered her a gesture of goodwill.“It was certainly not our intention to cause any offence, and our service was not as good as it should have been.“When verifying customers are who they say they are we have to balance our duty to protect the security of their accounts.”She added: “If a customer rings up with their banking credentials they should be able to pass security with no problems.“Santander works closely with LGBT+ colleagues and charities to identify the barriers that are in place to access our services.“We want all of our customers to be treated equally and fairly.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building.

If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar.

It\u0026#8217s fine to see it all coming together when you have put so much effort into it.\u0026#8221\nThe stall holders in the games hall include Viking Mead and Valhalla, the Thule/J W Gray, Shetland Reel Gin, Thistly Cross Cider, Lerwick Brewery and the Dowry/Beervana, while the committee is running a wines, spirits and prosecco stall.\nMusic on the Friday was provided by Sheila Henderson, Isaac Webb and the Boogie Boys, the Peter Wood Band, the Bashies and ended with a disco organised by Lynden Nicolson.\nMay and Mackie were one of the bands playing on Saturday evening.

Islands proofing really worked with Sumburgh Airport car parking charges, didn\u0026#8217t it?\nLet’s not forget though that one partner organisation currently does have considerable funds that are at arms length from government and do could do heaps to further progress towards these goals.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning.

We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

We must build on this while retaining those positive traditions and values that help to define us and which have withstood the test of time and adversity.\n“The visit of the Pope Francis can and should contribute to the new and positive relationship which has been developing between the Irish state and the Catholic Church,\" she explained. \n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27464  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades.\nToday, 24th August, marks the 50th anniversary of the first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon in County Tyrone. \nThe Brantry Republican Club, led by Annie Mary Gildernew, had campaigned against the lack of council housing in the area. \n spoke exclusively to Colm Gildernew, Sinn Féin MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and grandson of Annie Mary or better known as ‘Nana’ Gildernew, about the first civil rights march and events leading to it.\n“Fifty years ago, on the 12th of October 1967, Dungannon District Council convened its monthly meeting.  \n“One of the decisions they were about to take would reverberate across decades and bring the northern Unionist state to its knees and, some argue, ultimately led to its demise as a one party Orange state.\n“The Brantry Sinn Fein Republican Club, under the leadership of Annie Mary Gildernew  had been trying to secure housing in the local area for nationalist families. \n“Dungannon Council refused point blank to build social housing in the Brantry area as this would also provide local nationalists with votes as well as housing.  \nInstead they agreed to build 15 houses in the then predominantly unionist village of Caledon and stated they would allocate these homes on the basis of half to unionists and half to nationalist families to ease the housing crisis.\n“At the council meeting this deal was reneged upon Unionist Councillor William Scott simply presented a list of 15 names which he had decided would be housed, no debate, no discussion, no democracy.\n“The Brantry Republican Club met immediately to assess their next move.  It was decided that they were left with no alternative but to take immediate and direct action.  \n“At 2am, on Friday the 13th of October members of the Gildernew, Goodfellow and McKenna families supported by the Brantry Republican club went to Caledon and took possession of two of the newly allocated homes,  including a three bedroom house which had been allocated to a single 19-year-old woman who worked for a Unionist election candidate.  \n“In May 1968, following a 6 month series of court action and coercion, the State’s patience gave way a force of policemen, led by the brother of the young single girl who had been allocated the house, evicted Nana Gildernew, her daughter Mary Theresa Goodfellow with a three-month old baby and two other small children, and her daughter in law Geraldine Gildernew, expecting me at the time and with two young children.  They were forcibly dragged from the house under the gaze of the world’s press. \n“This led to the organisation of the first Civil Rights March from Coalisland to Dungannon was 24th of August to protest the eviction. The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27465  ","story":" Mícheál Mac Donncha\n\nON THE afternoon of Tuesday 30 August 1988, three IRA Volunteers were travelling along the main Omagh to Carrickmore road in County Tyrone. They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8623522.1536057161!/image/image.jpg","title":"red ensign tribute to merchant seafarers","story":"\nMerchant Navy Day has been marked with the raising of the Red Ensign at locations across Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.\n\n                \nThe initiative raises awareness of the UK’s ongoing dependence on Merchant Navy seafarers.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe Lord Lieutenant for County Antrim, Joan Christie CVO OBE, Larne Port Harbour Master Anthony Van Damme and the Mayor, Councillor Lindsay Millar were joined by guests and members of the public in a short ceremony at Larne Port on Monday. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe flag was also flown at the council’s main offices in Ballymena, Larne and Carrickfergus to support a nationwide call from the Seafarers UK charity and the Merchant Navy Association for the official flag to be flown on public buildings and landmark flagpoles.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nCllr Millar said: “As a borough steeped in maritime history and home to one of Northern Ireland’s biggest ports, we have always depended on merchant seafarers to protect our shores and import vital supplies.\n\n“We’re pleased to be supporting the ‘Fly the Red Ensign for Merchant Navy Day’ in honour of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice throughout our history.”\n\nIn the First and Second World Wars nearly 15,000 merchant seafarers were killed.\n\nLarne Harbour Master Anthony Van Damme said: “The annual event gives us an opportunity to highlight and commemorate the service of brave seafarers of the past, present and future.  “Larne Harbour offers a warm welcome to all Seafarers and supports their welfare whilst they carry out their work that is so vital to our economy.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMerchant Navy Day is commemorated on 3 September, the anniversary of the sinking of the SS Athenia, the first British merchant vessel lost during World War 2.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

We have come close in the past, making it to the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, so to go one better this season is a great feeling.\n\u0026#8220There is a real buzz and a belief in the team that we can go and win the Irish Cup in our first final.\n\u0026#8220We have gone up against teams from all over the Province this season to get to the final.\n\u0026#8220We didn\u0027t know too much about any of them, they were all an unknown quantity, but we played to our strengths and we have been rewarded.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

outside belfast to pay 17 more for gas","story":"\nTowns outside Belfast will be paying 17% more for gas prices following Firmus Energy\u0026#8217s tariff hike next month.\n\n                \nTen Town areas include Craigavon, Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Limavady, Derry/Londonderry and Newry.\n\n\n\nThis is a further blow for consumers\n\nThe Consumer Council\n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFirmus Energy is to increase gas prices by 12% in the Ten Towns area from 1 October 2018. The Consumer Council has branded the increase ‘unwelcome’ and called for more gas licence holders to enter the market so create more competition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council is urging the 38,000 natural gas domestic and business customers to consider ways to save on household energy bills.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAn annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Ten Towns areas using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £594 to £666, an increase of £72. Whereas the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Greater Belfast area using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £539 to £604, an increase of £65.\n\nGas prices in Ten Towns will be around 17% more expensive than Belfast, based on SSE Airtricity’s Pay As You Go tariff.\n\n“This is a further blow for consumers following recent electricity tariff increases by the three largest electricity suppliers in Northern Ireland,” said a NI Consumer Council spokesperson.\n\nRichard Williams, Head of Energy Policy at The Consumer Council, said: “This is unwelcome news for Firmus Energy customers, following a 6.8% increase in the Ten Towns area earlier this year. However, we are aware the main driver is the significant rise in global gas costs since the tariff was last set in April. From 1 October, the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in Ten Towns will increase by £72 a year to £666. It is the sole supplier of gas in the Ten Towns. We would like to see other gas licence holders enter the market so that consumers there can benefit from competition.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8626082.1536224983!/image/image.jpg","title":"family ask for prayers after young cameron truesdale passes away","story":"\nBrave Cameron Truesdale , who was battling a highly aggressive brain tumour, has sadly passed away.\n\n                \nA family statement said this morning: “Wednesday evening a piece of our heart was taken and carried to heaven.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Cameron passed away surrounded by his family.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“He fought with all his might for 20 months after we where given nine months.

After the Act of Remembrance, Bro Ward laid a wreath at the Herron family memorial plaque which was unveiled on the boundary wall of Dromore Orange Hall in April 2016 and is the only tangible memorial in Dromore to the history of the Troubles.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTown draper, William Herron , his wife Elizabeth  and daughter Noeline  died in the blaze after an incendiary device was planted in their Market Square drapery store in April 1976. The fire destroyed much of the shop and the family home above it, where the three victims died from suffocation. Bro William Herron was a member of Closkelt LOL 415 in Rathfriland District LOL No 3.\n\n* A series of commemorative events also took place across Northern Ireland last weekend as the Institution marked its inaugural Orange Victims Day. The Loyal Order formally remember the 335 Orangemen and one Orangewoman murdered by terrorists during the Troubles. The day, which will become an annual event, also highlighted the ongoing plight of the injured and bereaved.\n\n\n   \n                 .

people in the Ballymurphy area of West Belfast over three days in August 1971 will go ahead despite last week\u0026#8217s attempt by the MoD to derail proceedings.\n\nThe inquest was due to open on Monday but will now most likely start in November.\n\nAddressing the families during today’s preliminary hearing, Judge Siobhan Keegan said: “This inquest is due to start on Monday 10th September, over the past year we have tried to keep it on track and due to the work of ious bodies a lot of matters in this case have been kept on track.\n\n“However, there is a problem with this case. There have been some developments recently.”\n\nLast week the MoD handed over a database containing almost 5,000 names of former British soldiers to the Coroner’s Office.\n\nJudge Keegan said: “Having considered the matter and particularly the issue of the MoD discovery, which only came to me last week, what I have decided to do was convene a meeting of all legal representatives this week, which we have already done. \n\n“We set out where I saw the inquest going, what the problems were, what I want to happen going forward. \n\n“It seems to me that there is broad agreement to a sensible approach going forward. Evidence won’t start on Monday.” \n\nJudge Keegan continued: “I’m not going to be distracted from holding your inquest. I want to get on with it and I am also going to very actively case manage it, by holding a meeting with counsel every Monday.\n\n“There is a bigger picture here, there is an overriding public interest in dealing with your inquest for the families of the deceased, you all have this hanging over your heads.\n\n“I’m not going to let this case drift, I’m not going to adjourn it indefinitely, it’s too important.”\n\nDiscussing recent MoD revelations Judge Keegan said: “I do expect a more open and collaborative approach in relation to disclosure, there has been a real problem with this in this case.\n\n“In particular I want to address this issue of the MoD disclosure I received late on 29th of August. I know this has caused annoyance and distress to the next of kin. It came very late in the day, you will be aware that I immediately sought some explanation for it. I did receive from, there was regret expressed in it but truly I can’t really understand why this information couldn’t have been provided earlier to the Coroner’s Service. \n\n“It isn’t good enough to simply present an amount of material so late in the day, so close to a very important case. It’s just not acceptable, I want this information filtered in two weeks.\n\n“The MoD should be under no illusions that this must happen. It’s not going to distract me from getting on with your inquest but I am expecting that there is a better practice going forward. \n\n“I’m not going to sit here again and have this type of information given to me in this format.”\n\nThere will be a further preliminary hearing on Monday afternoon at 2.30pm.\n\nTen people were shot dead by the Parachute Regiment between 9-11 August 1971 in Ballymurphy, while an eleventh died of a heart attack after an altercation with British soldiers.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"markets residents stress the need for social homes at gates of city hall","story":"\n\nRESIDENTS \nfrom the Markets took to the gates of City Hall last night to reiterate their call that land marked for social housing remains so.\nResidents and campaigners gathered on Monday night to mark the first anniversary of Belfast City Council’s vote to earmark land on the Gasworks site – previously zoned for social housing – available instead for a hotel extension and a multistorey carpark.\nMembers from the Homes Now campaign group handed in a petition to Belfast City Council Chief Executive Suzanne Wylie as Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey and Deputy Lord Mayor, Alliance’s Emmett McDonough-Brown signed the Homes Now pledge.\nHomes Now campaigner Bernie Dobbin said: “The people of the Markets have waited too long for adequate social housing to be built in the area and we are no longer prepared to take verbal assurances from officials and politicians.\n“Time and again, these officials and politicians have broken their word and left residents high and dry. This is why we are asking councillors and officials to sign the Homes Now pledge – for their commitment to become a matter of public record.\n“Belfast City Council have sent out a lot of positive messages since the disgraceful decision of their Planning Committee last September, but still not a brick for new housing has been laid.

A further 1,492 names appear to be duplicates, meaning ‘when an individual has multiple regiments, or units on their Record of Service. \n\nThe Coroner’s Office had been attempting to trace former soldiers who may have  been in Ballymurphy during the three days in August 1971 when ten people were shot dead and one died of a heart attack.\nHowever, just days before the inquest was due to begin into the killings 47-year-ago the database containing nearly 5,000 names landed on the Coroner’s desk.\n\nSpeaking to the Andersonstown News Ballymurphy Massacre Families spokesperson John Teggart said: “Six working days before the start of our inquest and they  send this letter, this has been done before with the recent UVF story to attempt to delay our inquest.\n\n“Vital inquest resources are being used up here and that shouldn’t be happening, these stunts are nothing but a waste of time. We would now ask for more resources to be released on the back of this. All they  are attempting to do here is swamp the system days before we are due in court.\n\n“The families are devastated, we were and still are working towards this date, the Coroner  has been very focused in the lead up to this, she is now obliged to look at this list. We hope that it can be done in a speedy fashion.\n\n“We were prepared, we knew it wouldn’t be straight forward, when you’re working with the MoD the resources they have and the dirty deals they’ve been up to all along are well known. They’ve been sitting on their hands this entire time probably thinking they’d pull a stunt like this closer to the time [of the inquest], but to do it six days beforehand is utterly despicable.”\n\nMr Teggart continued: “Sure look at the UVF stunt a while ago, that was done to take the focus off the Paras and the Queen’s [regiment] another dirty tactic and I’d be confident that the MoD had a hand in it. \n\n“The UVF certainly weren’t out to help us that time and now the MoD have decided to swamp the inquest.”\n\nDiscussing what now needs to happen Mr Teggart said: “We need to remain focused and keep on track, we’ve had setbacks before and we’ve dealt with them, we will certainly deal with this one.\n\n“I hope there will be no delay we have a preliminary hearing on Thursday, the Coroner is demanding an explanation, she wants to know why this database has suddenly turned up and rightly so. \n\n“Our inquest is set to last 3-4 months, hopefully this database can be looked at in line with this time-frame so we aren’t setback.\n\n“When we were given a date for our inquest 18 months ago we clapped in the court, that’s unheard of. You now have good, independent people within the courts, the MoD have seen this so the only way they could try and delay this is with the dirty deals that they are doing now. \n\n“Bottom line is, the families are ready to go, the Coroner is ready to go, all the work’s done, the schedule has been set out, justice needs to be served.\u0026#8221\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bridge from northern ireland to scotland is a serious idea says professor","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It definitely can be done economically. \n\n\"There is concern about the cost of the project, but you know what they say you can have three economists you’d have four conclusions.  \n\n\"There are opinions either way about whether it can stack up or not.\"\n\nAt the conference Professor Dunlop also released the first artist impression of what the bridge might look like. \n\n\n\n\nWhy £15bn bridge to Scotland could be the answer to Brexit conundrum\n\n\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson backs bridge linking Northern Ireland and Scotland\n\n\n\n\nThe catalyst for the proposed bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland came from a speech made by Boris Johnson in January 2018 while he was the Foreign Secretary, in which he floated the idea of a 22-mile bridge across the English Channel to France - something he said would improve transport links after Brexit. \n\nProfessor Dunlop said the proposal wasn\u0027t feasible as the stretch between the United Kingdom and France is one of the busiest shipping channels in the world, but was asked shortly afterwards by Scottish newspaper The National if a similar project between Scotland and Northern Ireland was a possibility. \n\nHe laid out two proposals for the route - one from Larne and Portpatrick  or a crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head .\n\n\"One haulier I was speaking to was making dozens of trips across from Northern Ireland to Scotland every year and the cost of that was £600 each time. So when you take personalised stories like this you can see how the financial benefit would add up,\" Professor Dunlop said. \n\nThe proposal received a boost in March after a spokesman for the Scottish Government said it would \"initiate discussions to explore improving connectivity\" between the island of Ireland and Scotland, adding it was important \"that all options are fully considered\" \n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster and MP Sammy Wilson have both previously voiced their support for the project.  \n\nThe idea was also supported by former Foreign Secretary, who has called for it to be considered \"seriously\".  \n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37095871.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_Stitt_interview_26.jpg","title":"loyalist dee stitt resigns as ceo of charter ni","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It\u0027s as simple as my past is constantly affecting my future and I have no control over that and I never will.\" \n\nIn the wake of Mr Stitt\u0027s departure, Charter NI has said it will undergo a restructuring of its current staff and management. \n\n\n\n\nLoyalist Dee Stitt \u0027not a fit person\u0027 for charity position says commission\n\n\n\n\nLast week the Charity Commission ruled Mr Stitt was unfit to serve as the trustee of Kilcooley Community Forum, a group he has been a leading member of which was recently granted charitable status. \n\nHis application to join its Trustee Board was rejected over concerns around his criminality and how his home was targeted in a recent police drugs raid. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We believe that redistributing some of the money earmarked for corporation tax to skills, infrastructure and struggling small businesses will help to stimulate major economic growth.\" \n\nSpeaking at the event, Seamus McKeague, the head of Creagh Concrete in Co Antrim - which employs around 600 people - said the lack of an Executive was a drag on business growth. \n\n\"We need our own ministers to set strategy and guidance,\" he said. \n\n\"It\u0027s like the way you have to be in business - you have to show magnanimity and courage. \n\n\"You can\u0027t always be looking over your shoulder to see what might go wrong - so it should be the same in business. \n\n\"We\u0027d tell politicians to show the same magnanimity and courage that you have to show in business.\" \n\nRichard Hogg, of concrete firm Macrete, and a director of Precision Gear Company, said his business also wanted answers about what Brexit could hold, saying uncertainty was putting future deals for his wind turbine-related operation in doubt. \n\nAnd Nick Whelan, chief executive of Dale Farm, NI\u0027s biggest dairy co-operative, said he also wanted to ask questions about Brexit. \n\n\"I know we may be headed for a no-deal outcome, but there has to be some kind of contingency plan,\" he said. \n\n\"We need to find out what that contingency is because in the short-term at least, a no-deal will be catastrophic.\" \n"},{"url":null,"title":"prominent republican colin duffy mounts legal bid to force newspaper to reveal source of reports","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

on covert recordings of conversations allegedly held in Lurgan the following day. \n\nIn 2015 the Sunday World published two articles purporting to quote from the tapes. \n\nDuffy, McCrory and Fitzsimons sued the newspaper and the Chief Constable, claiming the source of the disclosure is a police officer. \n\nAs part of the proceedings they sought an injunction prohibiting the unidentified journalistic source from revealing any further contents of the covert recordings.\n\nThey also wanted an order compelling the newspaper to reveal the name or status of the person who supplied the material.\n\nAlthough the Sunday World refused to disclose its source, undertakings were given not to republish. \n\nLast year a High Court judge refused to grant the injunction, and ruled that the disclosure being sought was not important enough to override the public interest in protecting journalistic sources.\n\nCounsel representing Duffy and Fitzsimons are now appealing that decision.\n\nEdward Fitzgerald QC, for Duffy, argued that revealing just the status of the source \"did not then and never will lead to a reasonable chance\" of actually identifying them.\n\nBut the Sunday World\u0027s legal team contended that providing those details may result in the source being unmasked through a jigsaw identification process.\n\nLord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, sitting with Lord Justices Deeny and Treacy, confirmed the case will now go to a full hearing to decide on the issue.\n\nAmid debate over potentially narrowing the pool of candidates for the source, both sides were also asked to submit any evidence about anyone who had access to the confidential document.

tests on meat from Northern Ireland, England and Wales 145 were partly or wholly made up of unspecified meat. \n\nSome samples contained DNA from up to four different animals and others contained no meat from animals that were advertised. \n\nLamb was the meat mostly likely to be contaminated, followed by beef and goat, while cow DNA was the most commonly found contaminant in other meat.  \n\nMince meat as the most commonly contaminated product followed by sausages, kebabs and restaurant curries.\n\nSamples came from 487 different locations including restaurants and supermarkets.\n\nA number of the samples came from Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC revealed that 73 of the contaminated samples came from retailers across three supermarkets. 50 samples came from restaurants and 22 from food manufacturing or processing plants.\n\nOstrich DNA was found in one of the samples.\n\nThe majority of samples were tested for common food DNA such as cow, pig, sheep, goat, horse, chicken and turkey.\n\nThe FSA said that other animal DNA could have been prevent but not identified during testing as it was not being looked for.\n\nLocal authorities gathered the samples from businesses before sending them for analysis, this data was then sent to the FSA.\n\nThe FSA said that the level of contamination present suggested it was deliberate, with over 1% of a animal\u0027s DNA counting as deliberate. \n\nHowever the FSA said the results were \"not representative of the wider food industry\".\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37289182.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/freederrycorner.jpg","title":"trust apologises after pink free derry wall for organ donor

Alliance. Karen Bradley let the car out of the bag a few months ago.\n\nAnd, no, we weren\u0027t going to do that because of the tax and NI implications. Plus, all MLAs should be treated the same. Legislation is the answer.\n— Naomi Long MLA  \nSeptember 6, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIn a wide-ranging statement on efforts to restore powersharing, Mrs Bradley said she had has also decided not to call new Stormont elections and will bring forward legislation to allow civil servants to make decisions in the absence of ministers as public reforms like improving the efficiency of the electricity network across Ireland have stalled.\n\nShe is to hold talks with the local political parties in the next few weeks about re-establishing formal powersharing negotiations and has not ruled out appointing an external mediator to help break the deadlock.\n\nPublic services have suffered because no ministers are in place to make major decisions.\n\nControversial issues like provision of abortion or same-sex marriage have not been tackled in the absence of an Assembly.\n\nThe Assembly collapsed after Sinn Fein walked out of the ministerial Executive in a row about an overspending taxpayer-funded green energy scheme around 600 days ago.\n\nMrs Bradley’s intervention came as the former minister who oversaw the project, Jonathan Bell, told a public inquiry he had been briefed against as a “monster who had to be put to sleep”.\n\nMr Bell has previously claimed he was overruled by DUP advisers when he tried to close the Renewable Heat Incentive  scheme.\n\n\n\nIt is deeply frustrating and utterly careless that Sinn Fein has decided to block government for almost 600 days\nDUP leader Arlene Foster\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Unionist leader and former Stormont first minister Arlene Foster said: “It is deeply frustrating and utterly careless that Sinn Fein has decided to block government for almost 600 days.\n\n“Ultimately, Northern Ireland needs a ministerial decision-making mechanism which respects democracy.”\n\nSinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said: “The reduction in MLA pay should have been introduced months ago.\n\n“Sinn Fein told Karen Bradley that on several occasions but it is clear she was reluctant to move because of resistance from the DUP.\n\n“That position has now become untenable and it is right that wages are finally being reduced.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"cats books and snacks the eclectic items needed to summon people like a spell","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

The Hungarian football writer took on the mammoth task of watching at least one live half of football every day for a year from September 2017, and he’s just emerged on the other side.\n\n\nGame 365: Slovakia 3-0 Denmark - 🌍 Friendly\n\nTo say this 🇩🇰 side probably haven’t trained together, they were pretty organised at the back, and had a big chance to equalise in the 1st half. 🇸🇰 did have all the game, but it wasn’t embarrassing at all\n\nMotm: Chris Haagh\n#ends\n\n— Tomasz Mortimer  \nSeptember 5, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe 365th game was fittingly strange – a 3-0 win for Slovakia over a makeshift Denmark side who were without their top players after a contract dispute – but how did Tomasz’s crazy scheme come about in the first place?\n\n“It was the international break and there was barely any football on, but there was a Hungarian game,” Tomasz told the Press Association. \n\n“So I sarcastically tweeted something like: ‘Yay, at least we have Hungarian football today’, then my mate replied saying, ‘Do you think it would be possible to watch a game every day for a year?’ and I was like, ‘Yeah, I don’t see why not. I might try it’.”\n\nAs someone who watched a lot of football in the small hours while at school, college and university, this was something of a nostalgia trip for Tomasz, so he committed to the challenge on Twitter, and went for it.\n\n\nOkay, for the next 365 days I\u0027m gonna attempt to watch at least a half of live football every single day. Here starts the thread...\n— Tomasz Mortimer  \nSeptember 6, 2017\n\n\n\n\nDespite pledging to watch at least a half of football every day, Tomasz said he doesn’t think he missed more than 20 minutes from a single game.\n\nMeanwhile, the matches he watched took him all over the world, with the Premier League just one of many divisions he took in on his journey.\n\n\nGame 4: Stoke 2-2 Man United - 🇬🇧PL\n\nAs Premier League as it gets. Draw about deserved, Stoke so dogged.\n\nMotm: Maxim Choupo-Moting\n— Tomasz Mortimer  \nSeptember 9, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nGame 15: Benevento 0-4 Roma - 🇮🇹 Serie A\n\nSo one sided. Roma barely out of second gear throughout. Dzeko could\u0027ve had 6\n\nMotm: Edin Dzeko\n— Tomasz Mortimer  \nSeptember 20, 2017\n\n\n\n\nTweeting the score each day – along with the league, a brief game description and a man of the match – those who followed the thread were kept informed on fixtures they might otherwise have been completely unaware of.\n\n\nGame 25: Honved 1-4 Vasas - 🇭🇺NBI\n\nProper captitulation from the champions. Really poor from front to back\n\nMotm: Mohamed Remili\n— Tomasz Mortimer  \nSeptember 30, 2017\n\n\n\n\nAnd he even managed to find something to watch on Christmas Day, getting up at 07:00 to watch a Hong Kong senior shield semi-final match.\n\n\nGame 110: Southern District 0-1 Eastern - 🇭🇰Senior Shield\n\nEastern well in control until a crazy red card with 10 mins to go left them hanging on. Onslaught at the end was great entertainment and included a last second open goal miss. Woof \n\nMotm: Manuel Bleda\n— Tomasz Mortimer  \nDecember 25, 2017\n\n\n\n\nBut it wasn’t all fun and football games. Working a nine-to-five job, Tomasz was forced to watch plenty of games late at night, while he had to stay sober at social occasions so he could drive home and take in yet more football.\n\nFurthermore, not all games are classics. Far from it, in fact.\n\n“The worst was Royal Antwerp 0-0 Standard Liege,” said Tomasz. “[It] was crap, but it also spoilt my 51-day run without a 0-0, so I didn’t watch the Belgian league again after that in protest.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with any challenge, there are moments of weakness too. It won’t surprise you to hear that over the course of a year, there were close calls.\n\n“A couple of weeks ago I almost became complacent and I’d completely forget that I was doing it,” said Tomasz. \n\n“I guess it became such a part of my life that I was watching on auto-pilot by the end, so there was one night where I’d got into bed at about 23:00 then suddenly remembered I still had a game to watch.”\n\nBut while there were certainly obstacles to overcome, they were worth overcoming for the views that Tomasz got to gaze upon once in a while.\n\nNiche games were one such bonus, with the Chilean and Algerian leagues proving surprisingly exciting, while the law of averages meant that for every handful of awful games, there were sure to be some crackers in the mix.\n\n\nGame 177: Al Ain 6-2 Al Wahda - 🇦🇪 Pro League\n\nCrazy. Al Ain cruising 2-0 up with 25 to go before Dzsudzsak came on and scored twice within 5 minutes. A minute later, Al Ain hit straight back, and then proceeded to tear Al Wahda apart. Mad. Ness\n\nMotm: Marcus Berg\n— Tomasz Mortimer  \nMarch 1, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“My favourite was Al Ain 6-2 Al Wahda,” said Tomasz. “It was 2-0 with 20 minutes to go, then all hell broke loose. \n\n“Al Wahda got it back to 2-2 and then shipped four goals in 15 minutes. It was madness and basically a title decider. A ridiculous game of football.”\n\nAll in all Tomasz was able to watch over 1,000 goals at an average of 2.87 per game. He said that one lesson he’d learned from his experience was not to “commit to a year of doing something every day on a whim”, but will he ever attempt anything like this again?\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I would love to do it again, but by going to a live game at a stadium every day for a year,” he said. “But logistically it would be an absolute nightmare, and I think I’d probably have to win the lottery to be able to do it.\n\n“I did intend to have a break, but I’m actually flying to Finland tomorrow to watch Hungary play in Tampere. So that plan didn’t work out that well.”\n\nIt’s safe to say some people just can’t get enough of the beautiful game.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"council bulky lift derry large unwanted items next week","story":"\nResidents are being advised to have any large unwanted items they wish to dump at the ready for a council \u0027bulky lift\u0027.\n\nSinn Féin Councillor Eric McGinley has encouraged residents to avail of Council’s Bulky Lift service scheduled for Foyle Springs.\n\nCllr.

We would encourage the people of Northern Ireland to get behind Liam and cast their vote for this young creative between 27th August and 9th September.”\n\nThe BIC® KIDS Young Artist Award rewards creativity by taking children’s drawings from the fridge door on to massive public billboards returned in July this year. \n\nRegional finalists were chosen via an expert judging panel made up of creatives from the marketing, publishing and illustration industries and they will have their artworks used on 71 billboards across the UK and Republic of Ireland between August 27 and September 9. \n\nLiam’s artwork is up against 13 others in the public vote. The public vote is now open at \nBICKIDS/uk/youngartist\n to decide the overall champion.\n\nIf the young Derry lad wins, his masterpiece will be used on a further 26 billboards from late September.\n\nBe sure to support local lad, Liam, and get voting for him down to a fine art!\n\n\nPictured above: The impressive young Derry artist, Liam, aged 8, with his proud mum, Senga.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new radnor pictures knockout fun at new radnor carnival","story":"\nNew Radnor Carnival Queen, Bethan Evans with Princess, Ella Davies, and King, Jo\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsh Probert, and atte\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtndant Jack Hughes.

Only five players attended a pre-season meeting and Down took the field for their National League opener with barely 15 players.\n\nHowever, Rooney\u0026rsquos infectious enthusiasm has transformed Down and three months later the girls find themselves preparing for an All-Ireland showdown.\n\nSport is such a conundrum. All who have been involved in sport at any level can testify to the many frustrating and heartbreaking defeats sporadically interrupted by moments of sheer elation.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos these infrequent moments that keep players and coaches going year in year out in search of just one more. A half, a game even a season can be changed on a block, tackle, score or win and the momentum gathered can be infectious.\u0026nbsp\n\nA group, seemingly going nowhere except deeper into the abyss are suddenly galvanised, working for one another as if their lives depended on it. Success is like a lightning bolt. It can strike when you least expect it and you must keep the energy and drive going. You have to strike when the iron is hot.\n\nYet, as we all know, fairy tale endings only become fairy tale endings when the underdog performs to their very best and leaves the field of play with no regrets.\n\nOn their day the Down girls are a match for anyone as they have proved a number of times this year and they have also shown that when their backs are against the wall they can and have turned games around.\u0026nbsp\n\nDown have talented players all over the park. They will be led by Clonduff sisters Sara Louise and Fionnuala Carr, who were both on the side that won the All-Ireland Junior crown at Croke Park in 2014.\n\nThrow in in Bredagh\u0026rsquos Catherine Rocks, Liatroim\u0026rsquos Aimee McAleenan and Dearbhla Magee and you have the nucleus of an attack-minded side.\u0026nbsp\n\nHowever, Portaferry\u0026rsquos twin terrors Niamh Mallon \u0026mdash skipper of the 2014 side \u0026mdash and Saoirse Sands are the jewels in the Down crown and they have the potential to cut any defence to shreds and no better place to do that than Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of raised eyebrows when Down got the better of Tipperary thanks to a 58th minute goal from Sara Louise Carr to reach the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Intermediate final for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIt may have been a surprise, but there were indications that the Mourne girls were making real progress as the summer evolved.\n\nAdmittedly, the league was a disaster, as they lost all five outings, but then they got the better of Derry in the Ulster final. They followed that up with a draw against the much-fancied Oak Leafers in the opening round of the All-Ireland Championship.\n\nThat laid the platform for the rest of the campaign and they defeated Laois to bag the runners-up spot in Group 1 behind Cork, who had overcome all before them.\n\nTipperary topped Group 2 and were six points clear at half-time in the semi-final, but with the experiment of deploying Fionnuala Carr at full forward dispensed with, there was an immediate improvement as the Clonduff colossus began to exert greater influence from centre back. Nicole Kelly put the shackles on the dangerous Nicola Treacy too.\n\nMeanwhile, Niamh Mallon was busily keeping the umpire busy as she racked up nine points, seven from placed balls. That brought Down in touch and Sara Louise Carr, who got married earlier this year, pounced for the definitive goal to go with her earlier two points from play.\n\nCork will be desperate to get over the line having lost the last two deciders, including last year\u0026rsquos to Meath after a replay.\u0026nbsp\n\nMuch like their senior counterparts, they have cruised through to the final, finishing the group phase with a positive scoring differential of 65 points, compared to Down\u0026rsquos -2. Indeed, the Rebels were 12-point victors when the teams met in P\u0026aacuteirc Esler in July.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Leesiders possess a lot of firepower with Finola Neville, Caroline Sugrue and Katelyn Hickey well able to hit the target. Minor star Cliona Healy came off the bench to have a big impact in the semi-final win over Galway, scoring three points in as many minutes soon after her second-half introduction to edge the Leesiders clear and finishing with four.\n\nHealy wasn\u0026rsquot involved when the Leesiders garnered the Division 2 League title, but she and a handful of other colleagues from the All-Ireland-winning Minor Championship side have made the step up and with that sort of ability to be called upon, they will be hard to beat.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Arts Centre launches new programme  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWN Arts Centre has announced its latest arts programme.\n\nThe new-look autumn guide, covering September to December, is brimming with a huge range of exhibitions, music, theatre, comedy, talks, classes and workshops.\n\nA ied season of live performances gets off to a comedic start with Owen O\u0026rsquoNeill\u0026rsquos new one man play, \u0026lsquoTen Songs To Die For\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbsp Also billed for the autumn are local comedians Shane Todd with his hilarious brand new stand-up show \u0026lsquoHero\u0026rsquo and Kevin McAleer \u0026mdash a comedy apparition not to be missed.\n\nMusical highlights include celtic and country classics including the Leading Ladies, charismatic singer songwriter Grainne Duffy and the ever popular Illegals with Niamh Kavanagh.\n\nNew to Down Arts Centre is local musician Tony Wright who will provide a unique night of story and song with a killer sound track.\u0026nbsp\n\nAlso not to be missed is The \u0026lsquoLegend of Luke Kelly\u0026rsquo, a spectacular tribute to the greatest folk artist of the 20th century, a definite must-see for all fans.

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

A super effort. The only other male junior, Oliver Robinson,\u0026nbsp did a double. The U-13 boys 100m in 15.15 and a strong run in the 1500m saw him finish in 5\u0026rsquo40.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nA promising start to his career as a Year 8 athlete. The sole senior of the night was Davy Foster in 1,500m running a fast 4\u0026rsquo50. Maybe Davy will stick to these faster shorter distances to try and keep up with his daughters.\n\nGirls galore\n\nTwo of the aforementioned Foster girls competed in the U-11 girls\u0026rsquo 1200m. In a competitive race Jodi hit the finish line in 4\u0026rsquo17 then not far behind was the always-smiling Kari in an impressive time of 4\u0026rsquo43. They both also tried the long jump.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn the U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 100m EDAC had three runners. Heat one saw Kara Trainor finish well in second place in 15.01. In heat three we saw Lauren Madine win in\u0026nbsp a new PB time of 14.16 and Anna Gardiner come home in 15.67 with Lauren taking the overall win and gold medal for the distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nKara\u0026rsquos time placed her sixth overall. It was pleasing to see them follow the lead of the younger girls by trying a field event as well, in this case the discus. Commendable enthusiasm!\n\nFab five females\n\nThe U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 1500m saw a large field of 14 athletes, five of which were EDAC runners and which also included the top class City of Lisburn athlete Katie McCleery, who is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for her age category over this distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nMcCleery made her intentions clear from the start as she immediately hit the front. Lauren decided to track her run and see how she went and was closely followed by Anna Gardiner, Lucy Foster, Kara Trainor and Emily Burns.\u0026nbsp\n\nAll five EDAC athletes looked superb over the three and three-quarter laps. On the last bend McCleery tried to hold on, but Lauren moved up another gear waiting and cruised past to take first place with 100m to run and crossed the line in a superb time of 4\u0026rsquo57 which is a PB by 18 seconds and puts Lauren 8th in the UK for her age for 2018. That was an outstanding performance.\n\nAnna Gardiner was the next EDAC athlete to finish in 5\u0026rsquo05 which is also a significant PB.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\n\nThe PBs were coming thick and fast as Lucy Foster came home in 5\u0026rsquo17 which was 12 seconds better than her previous best. The ever-improving duo of Kara Trainor and Emily Burns battled it out to the end and almost needed a photo finish to separate them \u0026mdash their times were\u0026nbsp 5.41.34 and 5.41.90. This race was really exciting to watch with brilliant efforts from all the girls. By filling first, third, fourth, seventh and eighth places, in the field of 14, there is surely cause for celebration at the depth of talent within the EDAC ranks.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nLast girl to race was U-15 rising star Kirsti Foster in the 1500m. The girls were mixed with a strong U-15 boys\u0026rsquo field and Kirsti did not take the race lightly, despite carrying a slight niggle from hockey.\u0026nbsp\n\nShe dominated the girls\u0026rsquo field and beat some of the boys too in her race to finish a strong 5\u0026rsquo12 to provide a fitting finale to the night and to the track season.\n\nLaganside 10k\n\nPaula Radcliffe was obviously the star of the show, but EDAC had a few sparkling performances themselves.\u0026nbsp\n\nPaul Lloyd led the troops home and despite narrowly missing out on the elusive sub 40, he felt that he had given his all in the fast-paced race. His time of 40.08 is tantalisingly close and his consistency has to be commended.\u0026nbsp\n\nPhillip Vint, another man who rarely misses a weekend race, came next in 41.10 with Liam Keenan not far behind in 41.36. Gavin Hynds in 41.45 had plenty to celebrate as this was a PB and proves that marathon training doesn\u0026rsquot always slow you down and must be great morale booster for him.\u0026nbsp\n\nDeirdre v Paula?\n\nDeirdre Weatherall finished in 42.08 and was slightly disappointed with that. However, she was cheered up by the fact that Paula Radcliffe had decided to run in the pack and was seen in chat with ious folk en route.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis gave Deirdre the chance to have a sprint finish to the line with the women\u0026rsquos marathon world record holder.\n\nPaula also has European and World Championship medals too numerous to mention as well the accolade of four times Olympian. Many would defer to such greatness, but Deirdre is well known for her fresh-faced enthusiasm and took no time to decide that having a result sheet with her name one place ahead of Paula\u0026rsquos was an opportunity unlikely to be repeated.\n\nAfter reading on Wikipedia that Deirdre is described as the foremost tragic heroine in Irish legend and probably its best-known figure in modern times, she could probably argue that Paula should have been in awe of her rather than the other way round.\n\nThis is the spirit that is key to Deirdre\u0026rsquos rise in the ranks and long may it continue.\n\nLiam Smyth \u0026mdash veteran in terms of longevity in these events clocked up a respectable 44.42. Behind him another historic event was unfolding.\n\nGavin McConvey came in to the finish line in 53.51 declaring that the last time he saw a sub 54 minute 10K was in 2004. Not bad going Gavin, keep it up.\u0026nbsp\n\nRoisin Gaffney, another reliable EDAC runner, finished in 54.09 and for once found, despite her love of the sun, that the heat was oppressive and was glad to be done.\n\nDonal at the double\n\nDonal Smith headed to Kildare on Saturday to take part in an a 5k run in aid of the Injured Jockeys\u0026rsquo Fund - but having discovered that there was a 10K race nearby he decided in true horse lovers\u0026rsquo form to hedge his bets and do both. He did say afterwards that it was a lot for one day and he may need a few rest days, but knowing Donal, that won\u0026rsquot last for long.\n\nNo one from the club made their way to Derry on Sunday morning for the Waterside Half Marathon which this year was also the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships.\n\nWhat\u0026rsquos ahead?\n\nThis will probably come too late for regular readers of the weekly papers, but Tuesday is the night for the annual trek to Castlewellan for the lung busting, for some, Mill Hill Mile Challenge.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis is a race that is, or should be, on everybody\u0026rsquos bucket list so if you\u0026rsquore going don t\u0026rsquo forget you must register online beforehand.

They were freed on bail later that evening.\n\nAiring last November, the Alex Gibney-directed documentary was a hard-hitting examination of claims of state collusion in the murders, which broke new ground by publicly naming alleged suspects.\n\nThe six men killed in Loughinisland were Adrian Rogan, Barney Green, Dan McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Malcolm Jenkinson and Patsy O\u0026rsquoHare.\n\nClare Rogan, wife of Adrian Rogan, said the families would not be deterred in their search for truth and justice.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are shocked and appalled at the arrest of two journalists related to the No Stone Unturned documentary, which exposed the extent of state collusion between the state and loyalist paramilitaries in Loughinisland, she said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe British government have systematically denied and continue to cover up its role in the murder of six people in the Heights Bar.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThese arrests show the lengths of desperation that the British government and state forces are prepared to go to, in order to stifle the truth about what happened in Loughinisland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Police Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report into Loughinisland murders was one of the most damning expositions of state collusion in mass murder ever published.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoOur families, and many other families across the island, some of whom have been denied the basic right to an inquest, have campaigned for many years against state collusion and for truth and justice for our loved ones.\n\nSouth Down Sinn F\u0026eacutein MP Chris Hazzard has thanked those who came out to stand with the Loughinisland families on Friday night.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe arrests of two leading investigative journalists who helped lift the lid on collusion following the 1994 Loughinisland murders through \u0026lsquoNo Stone Unturned\u0026rsquo has re-opened many wounds for the families of those murdered, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThat truth would never have been possible without journalists like Barry and Trevor who acted always with integrity.

He started rowing back to shore, but one of the oars slipped overboard and into the water.\n\nAfter a few unsuccessful attempts to circle the oar, Mr Milligan decided to jump overboard to retrieve it. After getting the oar, Mr Milligan tried to swim back to the boat, but it was drifting away in the strong tide.\n\nA strong swimmer, Mr Milligan struck out for the shore and was about half a mile out when he was picked up by police in a rowing boat.\n\n\u0026ldquoI shouted to the children to keep calm and they did.

He is still the top bid. It is understood that two additional parties are interested in acquiring the 75,000 sq ft red brick building which once provided work for 400 people when it was owned by Hursts, part of the Ulster Weaving Group.\n\nNearly 150 years old, the five-storey mill was used for the wet spinning of flax and most of its flooring is tiled.\u0026nbsp This activity closed ten years ago.

He was 80. A native of Ballyronan, Derry, he moved with his family from Belfast to Shrigley after the outbreak of the last war and began his business in Killyleagh Street, Crossgar.\n\nHis conscientiousness at work meant that 12-hour days were common place.

A top class line-up includes Fergie, Houl Yer Whist, Dominic Hughes and a local supporting cast.\n\nDuring the past few months the boys and their leaders have been very busy. The cubs spent a very enjoyable five days at Clare, while 30 miles away the scouts were on a ten-day camp at Birr, Co Offaly.\n\nThe scouts won the Diocesan Shield and represented Dromore diocese a few weeks ago at the Melviin Trophy in Dublin where they gained considerable success.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash A harvest fair in Killinchy Presbyterian Church Hall on Saturday afternoon raised \u0026pound1,300 for church funds. There was a high standard of entries for the ious classes for bread, cakes, fruit and vegetables and sales were also good.\n\nThe crowds seemed to enjoy a iety of sideshows on the football pitch where darts shooting and beanbag games contributed to the fun.\u0026nbsp\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Local minister gets in tune for marathon on the organ  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA PLUMP cushion will be the Rev Mark Spratt\u0026rsquos best friend as he undertakes a 12-hour music marathon.\n\nThe minister of Kilmore Presbyterian Church, near Crossgar, is once again preparing to play an organ and piano non-stop to raise funds for the church.\n\nHe will be playing hundreds of psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, church music, classical pieces along with wedding favourites from 9am-9pm on Saturday, September 15.\u0026nbsp\n\nIt will the second time since 2014 that Mr Spratt will take to the keyboards to raise money for the Drumaghlis Road church where he is Director of Music.\n\nA renowned organist, Mr Spratt told the Recorder: \u0026ldquoI did a 12-hour marathon before in 2014 and that time we raised just over \u0026pound2,000 for the Women\u0026rsquos Association and other church activities.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis time it\u0026rsquos to raise money for repairs to the church\u0026rsquos roof and other property matters and I\u0026rsquoll be happy with whatever the community is able to give.\n\nMr Spratt has successfully completed two other music marathons for Bangor Presbyterian Church where he was part of the ministry team before he moved to Kilmore.

Hopefully this movement will be able to grow and put some pressure on the politicians to get back, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoA lot of people have said that maybe we should do this again and last week I encouraged those in attendance to take photographs and send them to their MLAs to show the support there is for them to get back to work.\n\nJoan said the simple message from last week\u0026rsquos meeting to the politicians was: \u0026ldquoWe elected you, get back to work.\n\nShe added: \u0026ldquoThe politicians are in effect our employees, we elected them to do a job for us and at the minute they are not delivering.

It is something they want to try and address to make the town even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.\n\nMournes councillor Laura Devlin said that due to the force of nature there was no way of maintaining a sandy beach, which was why s he believed a pop-up beach on top of the promenade was an alternative worth pursuing.\n\nShe believes the move would provide Newcastle with that beachy summer feel and was pleased council officers were to examine if a temporary beach could be provided and the costs involved.\n\n\u0026ldquoTourism is the district\u0026rsquos biggest economic driver so let\u0026rsquos see what more we can do to improve the product we have to offer and provide a new outdoor amenity for people in the resort as well, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Environment Agency has determined, along with other coastal erosion experts, that due to the construction\u0026nbsp\n\nof the promenade, sand is naturally depleted from Newcastle beach and there will never be enough of it to form a usable beach.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, difficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a return for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully functioning calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres.
