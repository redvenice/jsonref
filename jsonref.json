He also urged YSK members to \u0027do your job the right way\u0027, adding he believed the results would be \u0027very good\u0027.Opposition parties and NGOs deployed up to half a million monitors at ballot boxes to ward against fraud. They have said election law changes and fraud allegations in the 2017 referendum raise fears about the vote\u0027s fairness.Earlier, CHP spokesman Bulent Tezcan said the party had reported to the YSK allegations of block votes being cast and of election monitors being beaten and kept out of polling stations in the southeast\u0027s Sanliurfa province.YSK chairman Sadi Guven told the state-owned news agency Anadolu it was taking steps in response to reports of irregularities in the town of Suruc near the Syrian border.The government gave no immediate response to the reports, but Erdogan said there had not been any serious problems.           Earlier today opposition party member Mehmet Sıddık Durmaz (pictured) was reportedly shot dead \u0027during the voting process\u0027, local media said          A woman waits to vote at a polling station in snap twin Turkish presidential and parliamentary elections in Istanbul today          Turks went to the polls this morning in presidential and parliamentary elections that pose the biggest ballot box challenge to Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party since they swept to power over 15 years ago          Chairman of the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his wife Selvi Kilicdaroglu arrive to cast their ballot at a polling station during the parliamentary and presidential elections, in AnkaraTurkey has been under emergency rule - which restricts some freedoms and allows the government to bypass parliament with decrees - for nearly two years since an attempted coup in 2016.Erdogan blamed the coup on his former ally, U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, and has waged a sweeping crackdown on his followers in Turkey, detaining some 160,000 people, according to the United Nations.The president\u0027s critics, including the European Union which Turkey still nominally aspires to join, say Erdogan has used the crackdown to stifle dissent. \u0027This is no longer a Turkey we want. Rights are violated, democracy is in terrible shape,\u0027 said health sector worker Sema, 50, after voting in Istanbul.She and others in the city said they voted for the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u0027 Democratic Party (HDP), hoping it would exceed the ten per cent threshold of votes needed to enter parliament.

Erdogan has filed close to 2,000 lawsuits against people, including school children, for insulting him.       Hundreds of thousand of supporters of Muharrem Ince, the main presidential candidate facing Erdogan, gather in Istanbul yesterday          Recep Tayyip Erdogan held his own rally for the AK Party in the Esenyurt district of Istanbul yesterday          Erdogan at a rally of his own supporters this week in the city of Kahramanmaras on Thursday.

If you want, I can even cancel my Istanbul rally for you. Come, confront me, let\u0027s debate on TV.\u0027The event was the second giant rally the opposition leader addressed within the space of two days.Erdogan, a favourite to win the presidential polls, has in the past rejected the opposition candidate\u0027s proposal for a television debate, saying that \u0027I don\u0027t want anyone to get points through me\u0027.Ince has injected a breath of fresh air into the presidential campaign with his dynamism and oratorical skills comparable to those of Erdogan. In Ankara, Ince accused the state-run Anadolu news agency and TRT television of committing a \u0027constitutional crime\u0027 for failing to be even-handed.\u0027TRT aired Erdogan for 181 hours, Muharrem Ince for 15 hours,\u0027 he said.Turkey News, Pictures and Videos plus Erdogan Updates | Daily Mail Online¿Y¿ Party district head shot dead during voting in Turkish election"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/21/4D5DAB7B00000578-0-image-m-58_1529786970174.jpg","title":"Top private schools including Eton shun new GCSEs favour easier tests","story":"Give me £20billion or I\u0027ll bring you down: Defence...Share this articleParent Shazia Aktar, whose 15-year old daughter is doing her GCSEs, branded the pressure students are put under as \u0027disgusting\u0027.She told MailOnline: \u0027I have a 15 year old daughter who cried when she returned home from school on Thursday after finishing her history paper.\u0027She was so upset she locked herself in her bedroom, she didn’t get to complete her paper.

At its peak, his ‘business’ was bringing in £110,000 a month.Europol, an EU police agency, warned yesterday that people smugglers operating in Turkey and Greece were ‘frequent’ offenders in the trade in black market documents, which is an ‘important enabler’ of organised crime.          Abu Ahmad, who is known as ‘The Doctor’, helps smuggle people across the world by selling them stolen passportsAhmad said all the passports he sold were genuine – otherwise they would be no use at border control.They are either stolen or sold by their owners, who agree not to report them as missing for a few months, by which time they have been used by Ahmad’s customers.He said: ‘Most British passports are stolen. Except if the passport was in the name of someone Arabic or Pakistani or something, that could have been sold.’Ahmad said he had no qualms about profiting from stolen passports and, despite boasting he has smuggled thousands of people into Britain, insisted he was certain none of them were jihadis or criminals.But another Syrian immigrant in Turkey told the Mail at least two people Ahmad helped get into Europe were known Islamists operating in Damascus.The German authorities were alerted about them after their arrival, he said.Interpol, an international police agency, has a stolen and lost travel documents database, known as SLTD, which it says was searched more than 1.2billion times in the first nine months of 2016, providing 115,000 ‘hits’.But on its website, it admits: ‘Interpol is not automatically notified of all passport thefts occurring worldwide, and the SLTD database is not connected to national lists of stolen or lost passports.‘Despite the potential availability of the SLTD database, not all countries systematically search the database to determine whether an inidual is using a fraudulent passport.’In 2014, the head of the agency said just four in ten passports used for international flights were checked against the database.Labour MP John Woodcock, a member of the Commons home affairs committee, said: ‘At a time when several hundred potentially highly dangerous jihadis have fled when Islamic State has been deposed it’s highly alarming to learn that this way of entering the UK illegally seems to be so readily available.’Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, said: ‘Criminals who capitalise on the vulnerability of tourists and then profit off refugees and immigrants in desperate need of help must not be allowed to operate so freely.’          One of the stolen passports used to help get people through passport control and across borders. The Daily Mail bought one from Ahmad in Istanbul for £2,500David Lowe, a former Special Branch counter-terrorism officer now based at Leeds Beckett University, said: ‘For terrorists and criminals getting a new passport is like winning the lottery.‘It’s a significant concern with fighters coming from Islamic State or returning British fighters. Once you get in with somebody else’s passport you are very difficult to trace.’Immigration minister Caroline Nokes said: ‘One hundred per cent of passports are inspected at the border.‘Border Force officers are rigorously trained to prevent the holders of fraudulent documents from entering the country and between 2010 and March 2018, we denied entry to over 144,000 people.‘Immigration Enforcement constantly monitors and identifies emerging threats in relation to the production and supply of false travel documents, including the use of the internet to facilitate the trade in passports and identity cards.‘We have a range of interventions to target the criminals involved, including criminal prosecution of crime groups in the UK and overseas.’  \u0027All passports that get stolen get sold... and the British one is a strong passport\u0027: Brazen sales patter of \u0027The Doctor\u0027 who sold a UK passport for £2.5k Just 72 hours after putting out a request for a British passport we secured a meeting with a people smuggler who offered us five.Abu Ahmad, who is known as ‘The Doctor’, used to operate openly among fellow Syrian migrants hoping to reach to Western Europe.However, since being put on the Interpol wanted list, the former heart surgeon has gone to ground and regularly changes his phone and home to evade the attention of the authorities.The loss of his ship and the police investigation meant he had to move to the city, but it did not stop him working: ‘I have continued to people smuggle, but more secretly. More carefully. I stay out of the picture.‘I don’t know if the police know. I have no idea honestly. But for sure they’re watching me. I try to change my numbers regularly and change my whereabouts regularly.’The change in circumstances means Ahmad is now making around £3,500 a month – which is still ten times the average monthly salary in Turkey.To maintain his network of contacts, he travels widely using an Omani passport and has recently visited North Africa.After our meeting with him, he was due to travel to Libya and then to Canada. ‘Every time I travel I use a stolen passport,’ he said, smiling. ‘I have never had problems travelling on a stolen passport.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/10/4D937B9000000578-0-image-m-8_1529833601273.jpg","title":"Ministers tell big business stop undermining Theresa Brexit","story":"    Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt rounded on the French-based aerospace giant Airbus for making ‘completely inappropriate’ threatsAirbus, which employs 14,000 people in the UK, warned last week that it could quit the country if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.This was followed up by a claim from BMW that its British operations would become ‘less competitive’ unless ministers provide clarity on future trading relationships with the EU soon.Yesterday it emerged that five business lobby groups, headed by the Confederation of British Industry, have written to the Prime Minister warning that a lack of clarity on Brexit ‘could cost the UK economy billions of pounds’.They have copied in Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, and Donald Tusk, president of the European Council.Asked about the intervention from Airbus, Mr Hunt told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show yesterday: ‘I thought it was completely inappropriate for businesses to be making these kinds of threats for one very simple reason.Jeremy Hunt lashes out at Airbus for \u0027completely...Give me £20billion or I\u0027ll bring you down: Defence...Share this article‘We are at an absolutely critical moment in the Brexit discussions and what that means is that we need to get behind Theresa May to deliver the best possible Brexit – a clean Brexit.‘What businesses want... is clarity and certainty and the more that we undermine Theresa May, the more likely we are to end up with a fudge, which would be an absolute disaster for everyone.’Meanwhile, Dr Fox told Sky News: ‘Companies are right to say that if there’s no deal that won’t be good for Britain, but it won’t be good for Europe either.‘The point I make to them is that they should also be making the same case to European governments. That will be bad for them in an era where we have got complex integrated supply chains. It will be necessarily bad for both sides.’Senior Tories believe big business is being urged to speak out publicly by leading Cabinet Remainers, including Business Secretary Greg Clark and Chancellor Philip Hammond, in order to strengthen their hand in the debate about future trading relations with the EU.Some in Downing Street believe pro-Remain ministers are using business to try to tilt the debate ahead of a crunch meeting at Chequers next month when the Cabinet will try to thrash out its strategy for future dealings with the EU.Mr Clark held private talks with Airbus days before it spoke out. And yesterday it emerged that he holds weekly meetings with a coalition of business lobby groups that have issued a fresh warning over Brexit to the Prime Minister.

If the NHS can get an extra £20billion a year, then defence surely deserves one tenth of that just to stand still.’But other Tory MPs believe Mr Williamson is stoking the row about defence spending to boost his standing in a future Tory leadership race.In a thinly-veiled swipe, which was also directed in part at Boris Johnson, former minister Nick Boles said: ‘Would it be too much to ask that senior members of the Cabinet behave like grown-ups, discuss serious issues in a serious way, and avoid running to the papers with childish threats?’Another MP said Mr Williamson was at risk of over-playing his hand. ‘There are many who are huge defenders of the military and have been working hard to make the case to protect the deployable capability that keeps us a tier one nation,’ the MP said. ‘But there’s no way we’d break cover now to back this weaselly attack on the PM. Williamson’s intemperate and frankly bizarre media posturing shows just how unsuited he is for any high office whatsoever.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/25/01/4D99E43800000578-5881221-image-a-10_1529886701861.jpg","title":"More 30 000 children aged 10 15 say gangs","story":"    Anne Longfield, the Children\u0027s Commissioner for England, warned children are being groomed by drug gangsSenior police figures have warned that thousands of children  as young as 10 are taking part in gang activity like drug running.Overall it is estimated that more than 30,000 children between the ages of 10 and 15 identify as being part of a gang - with authorities warning that the total number of youths involved with criminal networks is closer to 70,000. According to the Times, Anne Longfield, the children\u0027s commissioner, warned that children were being trapped by experienced gang leaders using a \u0027systematic and well-rehearsed business model\u0027.\u0027Just like with paedophiles and traffickers, they trap victims into a triple trap of debt, threat, and enticement.

Brighton College headmaster Richard Cairns","story":"    Mr Cairns says his pupils found it \u0027liberating\u0027 to switch off their phonesLook around the school where I work, and at lunchtimes these days you will see groups of pupils huddled together in intense concentration.You might imagine they’re poring over the tiny screens of their mobile phones, giggling at some YouTube video or app. But no, they are actually battling over a game of Cluedo or Monopoly, seeking the bragging rights of having outwitted their classmates.In our sometimes bewildering age of technological sophistication, such traditional games might seem but a quaint throwback for a generation who’ve grown up with computers, tablets and mobile phones.Yet one of my more gratifying experiences has been to witness their miraculous revival among the pupils of Brighton College, a mixed independent school where I am the Head Master.To the surprise of many of them, they’ve become completely absorbed in the intrigue and strategy of games such as Cluedo, Monopoly and Risk, which are teaching them to celebrate their triumphs and accept their setbacks.So why are they playing them at all? Because, back in September, I decided to bring in severe restrictions on the use of mobile phones at school. And the results have been little short of revelatory.With screen and apps no longer so dominant on the premises, the attention of the pupils has turned elsewhere — and some of it has focused on those board games.Of course, we knew there would be a void to fill in the absence of mobiles, so we invested in a formidable stock of age-old games such as Scrabble, which not only engage the brain far more aggressively than addictive computer video games such as Candy Crush, but, just as importantly, promote social interaction. What the experiment has taught me and the pupils is just how much of a hold smartphones have over society — and just how liberating it can be to switch them off.What’s remarkable is how the benefits of the mobile phone ban can be seen in so many ways within the school.There is more interest in sport and drama, less in social media and selfies. It is infinitely preferable to see a 12-year-old with a cricket bat in his hand than a mobile phone.Pupils are also finding they enjoy actual conversations in the real world, instead of being hooked on superficial exchanges in the virtual one.Take away the phones and you take away the negative reason for pupils not to talk to each other. Just as pleasingly, we have seen an increase in reading. The school librarian has told me that the number of books being taken out by pupils has risen sharply since the ban was introduced.I don’t want to sound authoritarian or anti-technology. The mobile phone is one of the great innovations in mankind’s physical progress, transforming communications, commerce and entertainment.But, like all inventions, its use has to be handled responsibly. And in schools, there can be a significant downside to unrestricted access to mobiles.Fears state students could be \u0027shut out of top universities\u0027...JAN MOIR: Why we must ban phones in school now...whatever...Mobile phone entrepreneur John Caudwell in Lyme disease...Share this articleHaving one to hand makes it harder to concentrate, and harder to sleep well, too. Mental health can be undermined by the relentless pressure of social media, reflected in the neurotic obsession with not missing any tweet or text, no matter how trivial.One American study found that 50 per cent of children say they are addicted to their phones, while 80 per cent admit they check their devices at least every hour.Then there’s the darker side: the mobile phone can be an instrument for both bullying and classroom disruption.Although poor behaviour is not a problem at Brighton, I have been told by teachers elsewhere about the difficulties of maintaining order in classrooms where phones are allowed, especially when pupils actually film lessons or take photos of the teacher.           Brighton College, where head teacher Richard Cairns says the phone ban has been a massive successThe tolerance of such conduct is a recipe for a disastrous breakdown in respect for staff.Gratifyingly, several leading figures in politics and education are now aware of the harm that can be caused to youngsters by mobile phones.Last week, Matt Hancock, the Culture Secretary, urged schools to ban them on the grounds that they fuel bullying and distract from learning.‘I believe young children don’t need access to social media. They are children, after all. They need to be able to develop their social skills in the real world first,’ Hancock rightly said in a speech to the NSPCC.His call was echoed by Amanda Spielman, the Head of Ofsted, who argued that ‘technology has made the challenge of low-level disruption even worse’, and she supported a mobile ban in schools.If Brighton’s experience is anything to go by, such an approach will be a success.There is nothing cruel or unjust about such toughness. On the contrary, it is more compassionate because it gives pupils the space to learn and grow.Under our policy, day pupils in years seven, eight and nine — that is approximately from ages 11 to 14 — are required to hand in their mobiles to teachers at the beginning of the day. They then collect their phones when they go home, between 4pm or 5pm.Boarders, who make up about 40 per cent of the school roll, are required to follow the same restrictions in these years. In addition, they must hand back their phones at bedtime.Older pupils have fewer restrictions, but those in Year 10 still have to subscribe to three days of ‘detox’ without phones, while those in the year above have one ‘detox’ day.When I first brought in the policy, I was told it would not work. I was warned the pupils would ‘kick off’ because they are so hooked on their mobiles.But nothing of the sort happened. In fact, our pupils welcomed the change because it relieved them of the burden of being online the whole time.They found they had more freedom, more time for contemplation. ‘We don’t miss our phones at all,’ a group of Year 9 pupils told me.The process of learning has been enhanced, which is what other research has discovered. A 2015 study by the London School of Economics found banning phones raised pupils’ test scores by 6.4 per cent.And it’s not just better for their work. Boarders have also experienced better sleep without the online frenzy before they go to bed, a vital factor when young people’s brains are still developing.Crucially, it’s also easier for teachers to spot bullying of pupils, or pupils who are feeling isolated: so much online intimidation and taunting — so bad for teenagers’ mental health — is hidden by cyberspace. All in all, the experiment has been so successful that next year the school is to extend the five-day mobile ban to Year 10 pupils.I believe that one compelling reason why the pupils may have accepted the ban so readily is because today’s pupils are generally conservative with a small ‘c’ — fully focused on making a success of their time at school and happy to be relieved of any obstructions to achieving that success.Every generation rebels against its predecessor, and this one’s rebellion is to be more serious, dedicated and responsible. That is why they work harder, drink far less, take fewer drugs, have greater social awareness and are more orientated towards their careers.That’s why they have accepted the phone ban with good grace, and I only hope other schools across the country have the same idea.The fact is, the pupils will realise how good it is for them only once their smartphones have been put away. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/25/08/4D9B1EB500000578-5881919-image-m-15_1529913539536.jpg","title":"BBC presenter accidentally brands Health Secretary Jeremy C","story":"    The blunder came as Justin Webb read out a newspaper story about Jeremy Hunt (pictured on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show yesterday)          Webb claimed he had \u0027swerved\u0027 the verbal slip, but listeners were in no doubt about what they had heardCannabis on the NHS for children \u0027by 2019\u0027: Astonishing...Share this articleWebb tried to head off the inevitable mockery by claiming he had \u0027swerved\u0027 away from pronouncing the full four-letter word.However, listeners were convinced they had heard it.He was reading out a story from the Daily Express during the programme\u0027s review of newspapers and news websites. It is not the first time a Today presenter has been embarrassed by the Health Secretary\u0027s name. James Naughtie made the error while Mr Hunt was culture secretary.           Webb (pictured) tried to head off the inevitable mockery by claiming he had \u0027swerved\u0027 away from pronouncing the full four-letter word"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/18/4D96EF9E00000578-0-image-m-10_1529859651638.jpg","title":"Female reporter lectures football fan tries kiss her","story":"    Julia Guimarães was filming to camera when a football fan approached and tried to kiss her\u0027Don\u0027t do this.

The couple said one visitor described it as a \u0027Tardis\u0027\u0027We gradually started nibbling away the grass, expanding the borders and removing overgrown conifers, with the idea of iding the garden up into different sections, which couldn\u0027t all be seen at once.\u0027Much of the garden was very dry and shady, so we had to learn how to work with that and one of the solutions was to put interesting garden buildings in the very worst places, where nothing would grow.\u0027Brian loves working with wood and his first effort was the Japanese teahouse in the farthest dark, dry corner of the garden, so the area around that grew into a oriental garden, screened off by large bamboos.\u0027Things really gathered pace when we retired eight or nine years ago. And things then got a bit out of hand and the surprises got more and more surprising.          The rear of the garden in the early 1990s shows the World War Two bunker being transformed into the grotto, one of the first main features of the garden          The rear of the Bailey\u0027s house in the early 1990s is almost unrecognisable to what it is like today  Mr Bailey places shells onto the ceiling of an old World War Two bunker that was transformed into a grotto in their secret garden, with the entrance hidden behind a gothic summerhouse. The couple, right, say they spend hours each day tending to their creation\u0027Brian built a stone folly to link the fernery to the oriental garden and we turned on old underground air raid shelter into a shell grotto, with the entrance hidden behind a gothic summerhouse.\u0027The sunny borders near the house are all colour themed and the paved terrace was reorganised with an open veranda, raised lion\u0027s head fountain and lots of pots and hanging baskets.\u0027Every year we say we won\u0027t do as many baskets and then every year we end up doing even more.\u0027There was lots of trial and error, both in terms of design and planting, but we just learnt as we went along and changed the things that didn\u0027t work.\u0027          The property sits on a quiet cul-de-sac in Wolverhampton, with no sign of what lies in its back garden          The rear of the house has been transformed with a veranda and many different flowers and roses. The patio also works as a tea garden for visitors          The front of the house, which was built in the 1930s has also been transformed with flowers, tress and shrubsThe couple have found a clever way to water the garden by installing large, hidden water tanks, which collect rain water off the roof and distribute it through leaky hoses snaking down the borders.But Mrs Bailey admitted the garden still took hours of pruning and deadheading each day.She said: \u0027We are such plantaholics that the beds are stuffed with plants, so there is no room for weeds, but we have to do a lot of refereeing, to save the shyer plants from the bullies.\u0027Managing the trees, so they don\u0027t overwhelm the garden, also requires constant vigilance, as does the ongoing battle with slugs and snails.\u0027One visitor said ours was a Tardis garden - bigger on the inside than the outside and another even claimed to be lost once.\u0027We wanted to create a garden that has something unexpected around each corner and we seemed to have done that.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/04/4D92B4F400000578-5879007-When_Alaska_Airlines_flight_crew_could_not_communicate_with_Mr_C-a-1_1529811177582.jpg","title":"Portland girl 15 uses sign language help deaf blind man","story":"    Clara Daly (right), 15, has become a viral sensation on social media after her act of kindness to help deaf and blind man Tim Cook (left) on a six-hour flight from Boston to Portland last week          When Alaska Airlines\u0027 flight crew could not communicate with Mr Cook the teenager came to the rescue, talking to him for the remainder of the flight by signing into his hand (pictured)The teenager\u0027s act of kindness has  earned her praise from her fellow passengers, the airline and her mother Jane, who was travelling with her daughter.But no praise for Ms Daly has been more glowing than that from the man she helped.Speaking to Portland TV station KGW8, Mr Cook simply said: \u0027She\u0027s an angel\u0027.Lynette Scribner, who was seated next to Mr Cook, took to Facebook just moments after stepping off the plane to tell the amazing story.Her post and photos of Ms Daly signing into the palm of Mr Cook\u0027s hand mid-flight have now been liked almost 950,000 times. Just call him Michael Rap-a-Port Authority!

He also urged YSK members to \u0027do your job the right way\u0027, adding he believed the results would be \u0027very good\u0027.Opposition parties and NGOs deployed up to half a million monitors at ballot boxes to ward against fraud. They have said election law changes and fraud allegations in the 2017 referendum raise fears about the vote\u0027s fairness.Earlier, CHP spokesman Bulent Tezcan said the party had reported to the YSK allegations of block votes being cast and of election monitors being beaten and kept out of polling stations in the southeast\u0027s Sanliurfa province.YSK chairman Sadi Guven told the state-owned news agency Anadolu it was taking steps in response to reports of irregularities in the town of Suruc near the Syrian border.The government gave no immediate response to the reports, but Erdogan said there had not been any serious problems.           Earlier today opposition party member Mehmet Sıddık Durmaz (pictured) was reportedly shot dead \u0027during the voting process\u0027, local media said          A woman waits to vote at a polling station in snap twin Turkish presidential and parliamentary elections in Istanbul today          Turks went to the polls this morning in presidential and parliamentary elections that pose the biggest ballot box challenge to Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party since they swept to power over 15 years ago          Chairman of the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his wife Selvi Kilicdaroglu arrive to cast their ballot at a polling station during the parliamentary and presidential elections, in AnkaraTurkey has been under emergency rule - which restricts some freedoms and allows the government to bypass parliament with decrees - for nearly two years since an attempted coup in 2016.Erdogan blamed the coup on his former ally, U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, and has waged a sweeping crackdown on his followers in Turkey, detaining some 160,000 people, according to the United Nations.The president\u0027s critics, including the European Union which Turkey still nominally aspires to join, say Erdogan has used the crackdown to stifle dissent. \u0027This is no longer a Turkey we want.

Erdogan has filed close to 2,000 lawsuits against people, including school children, for insulting him.       Hundreds of thousand of supporters of Muharrem Ince, the main presidential candidate facing Erdogan, gather in Istanbul yesterday          Recep Tayyip Erdogan held his own rally for the AK Party in the Esenyurt district of Istanbul yesterday          Erdogan at a rally of his own supporters this week in the city of Kahramanmaras on Thursday.

If you want, I can even cancel my Istanbul rally for you. Come, confront me, let\u0027s debate on TV.\u0027The event was the second giant rally the opposition leader addressed within the space of two days.Erdogan, a favourite to win the presidential polls, has in the past rejected the opposition candidate\u0027s proposal for a television debate, saying that \u0027I don\u0027t want anyone to get points through me\u0027.Ince has injected a breath of fresh air into the presidential campaign with his dynamism and oratorical skills comparable to those of Erdogan. In Ankara, Ince accused the state-run Anadolu news agency and TRT television of committing a \u0027constitutional crime\u0027 for failing to be even-handed.\u0027TRT aired Erdogan for 181 hours, Muharrem Ince for 15 hours,\u0027 he said.Turkey News, Pictures and Videos plus Erdogan Updates | Daily Mail Online¿Y¿ Party district head shot dead during voting in Turkish election"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/21/4D98C3B500000578-5879277-image-m-6_1529870929133.jpg","title":"England step cauldron Nizhny Novgorod face Panama World Cup","story":"    Hat-trick hero Harry Kane clutched the match ball as he landed in St Petersburg after putting three goals past Panama in a historic World Cup win          England secured their biggest ever World Cup victory, thrashing their Group G opponents 6-1 in their second game of the tournament            Kane celebrated his three goals against Panama by taking the match ball with him as England flew back to St Petersburg          One to remember!

At its peak, his ‘business’ was bringing in £110,000 a month.Europol, an EU police agency, warned yesterday that people smugglers operating in Turkey and Greece were ‘frequent’ offenders in the trade in black market documents, which is an ‘important enabler’ of organised crime.          Abu Ahmad, who is known as ‘The Doctor’, helps smuggle people across the world by selling them stolen passportsAhmad said all the passports he sold were genuine – otherwise they would be no use at border control.They are either stolen or sold by their owners, who agree not to report them as missing for a few months, by which time they have been used by Ahmad’s customers.He said: ‘Most British passports are stolen. Except if the passport was in the name of someone Arabic or Pakistani or something, that could have been sold.’Ahmad said he had no qualms about profiting from stolen passports and, despite boasting he has smuggled thousands of people into Britain, insisted he was certain none of them were jihadis or criminals.But another Syrian immigrant in Turkey told the Mail at least two people Ahmad helped get into Europe were known Islamists operating in Damascus.The German authorities were alerted about them after their arrival, he said.Interpol, an international police agency, has a stolen and lost travel documents database, known as SLTD, which it says was searched more than 1.2billion times in the first nine months of 2016, providing 115,000 ‘hits’.But on its website, it admits: ‘Interpol is not automatically notified of all passport thefts occurring worldwide, and the SLTD database is not connected to national lists of stolen or lost passports.‘Despite the potential availability of the SLTD database, not all countries systematically search the database to determine whether an inidual is using a fraudulent passport.’In 2014, the head of the agency said just four in ten passports used for international flights were checked against the database.Labour MP John Woodcock, a member of the Commons home affairs committee, said: ‘At a time when several hundred potentially highly dangerous jihadis have fled when Islamic State has been deposed it’s highly alarming to learn that this way of entering the UK illegally seems to be so readily available.’Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, said: ‘Criminals who capitalise on the vulnerability of tourists and then profit off refugees and immigrants in desperate need of help must not be allowed to operate so freely.’          One of the stolen passports used to help get people through passport control and across borders. The Daily Mail bought one from Ahmad in Istanbul for £2,500David Lowe, a former Special Branch counter-terrorism officer now based at Leeds Beckett University, said: ‘For terrorists and criminals getting a new passport is like winning the lottery.‘It’s a significant concern with fighters coming from Islamic State or returning British fighters. Once you get in with somebody else’s passport you are very difficult to trace.’Immigration minister Caroline Nokes said: ‘One hundred per cent of passports are inspected at the border.‘Border Force officers are rigorously trained to prevent the holders of fraudulent documents from entering the country and between 2010 and March 2018, we denied entry to over 144,000 people.‘Immigration Enforcement constantly monitors and identifies emerging threats in relation to the production and supply of false travel documents, including the use of the internet to facilitate the trade in passports and identity cards.‘We have a range of interventions to target the criminals involved, including criminal prosecution of crime groups in the UK and overseas.’  \u0027All passports that get stolen get sold... and the British one is a strong passport\u0027: Brazen sales patter of \u0027The Doctor\u0027 who sold a UK passport for £2.5k Just 72 hours after putting out a request for a British passport we secured a meeting with a people smuggler who offered us five.Abu Ahmad, who is known as ‘The Doctor’, used to operate openly among fellow Syrian migrants hoping to reach to Western Europe.However, since being put on the Interpol wanted list, the former heart surgeon has gone to ground and regularly changes his phone and home to evade the attention of the authorities.The loss of his ship and the police investigation meant he had to move to the city, but it did not stop him working: ‘I have continued to people smuggle, but more secretly. More carefully. I stay out of the picture.‘I don’t know if the police know. I have no idea honestly. But for sure they’re watching me. I try to change my numbers regularly and change my whereabouts regularly.’The change in circumstances means Ahmad is now making around £3,500 a month – which is still ten times the average monthly salary in Turkey.To maintain his network of contacts, he travels widely using an Omani passport and has recently visited North Africa.After our meeting with him, he was due to travel to Libya and then to Canada. ‘Every time I travel I use a stolen passport,’ he said, smiling. ‘I have never had problems travelling on a stolen passport.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/20/4D98887E00000578-0-image-m-107_1529867865926.jpg","title":"Grandmother catches fox bed St Albans home Hertfordshire","story":"    This fox was caught on Marion Owen\u0027s bed after she got home to St Albans, Hertfordshire after a weekend away Hurry up, Mummy, we\u0027re ever so peckish!

Friends of the Defence Secretary said he was right to go into battle for funding for the military, which has been hit by heavy cuts in recent years.One senior Tory said that as many as 50 Tory MPs were so exercised over the issue that they could vote to block the Budget this autumn unless Mrs May and Chancellor Philip Hammond open the purse strings.‘There are 50 MPs who are willing to throw themselves under a bus over this,’ the source said.‘These are people who understand defence and understand that we need to be investing more if we are going to maintain our status as a major defence power.‘The Budget is one of the few real levers that people have got –everyone understands that.’Give me £20billion or I\u0027ll bring you down: Defence...Philip Hammond paves the way for tax hikes as he warns he...Core of Grenfell cladding panels burned as hot as flaming...Share this articleAnother said: ‘The big story here is that there is a significant group of Tory MPs who feel passionately about this and who are prepared to back that up with action.‘Gavin is a former chief whip – he understands the numbers and the implications for the Government’s majority.’ Mrs May is said to have caused a ‘shockwave’ last week by questioning the UK’s status as a ‘tier one’ military power in a meeting with Mr Williamson, chief of the defence staff General Sir Nick Carter and Mr Hammond.The UK is one of a handful of tier one powers along with the United States, Russia, France and China.Membership of the club requires ‘full spectrum’ capabilities, including a nuclear deterrent, combat jets, a navy capable of deployment anywhere in the world, intelligence-led counter terrorism forces, cyber defences and a deployable army ision capable of engaging in a land war.Mrs May ducked a direct question about the UK’s tier one status last week, but insisted: ‘We are a leading defence nation and that will continue.’In the coming weeks, she will face fresh calls to loosen the purse strings when she is briefed on backbench concerns by a powerful delegation comprising defence committee chairman Julian Lewis, foreign affairs committee chairman Tom Tugendhat and Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories.Dr Lewis last night warned that Mrs May could not afford to ignore backbench opinion on the issue. ‘There need be no political risk to the Prime Minister – if she does the right thing,’ he said.‘I’ve been in parliament for 20 years and I’ve never known such unanimity. If the NHS can get an extra £20billion a year, then defence surely deserves one tenth of that just to stand still.’But other Tory MPs believe Mr Williamson is stoking the row about defence spending to boost his standing in a future Tory leadership race.In a thinly-veiled swipe, which was also directed in part at Boris Johnson, former minister Nick Boles said: ‘Would it be too much to ask that senior members of the Cabinet behave like grown-ups, discuss serious issues in a serious way, and avoid running to the papers with childish threats?’Another MP said Mr Williamson was at risk of over-playing his hand. ‘There are many who are huge defenders of the military and have been working hard to make the case to protect the deployable capability that keeps us a tier one nation,’ the MP said. ‘But there’s no way we’d break cover now to back this weaselly attack on the PM. Williamson’s intemperate and frankly bizarre media posturing shows just how unsuited he is for any high office whatsoever.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/11/4D73C8E000000578-0-image-m-20_1529836588553.jpg","title":"Andrea Leadsom says customs partnership EU unwieldy

Brighton College headmaster Richard Cairns","story":"    Mr Cairns says his pupils found it \u0027liberating\u0027 to switch off their phonesLook around the school where I work, and at lunchtimes these days you will see groups of pupils huddled together in intense concentration.You might imagine they’re poring over the tiny screens of their mobile phones, giggling at some YouTube video or app. But no, they are actually battling over a game of Cluedo or Monopoly, seeking the bragging rights of having outwitted their classmates.In our sometimes bewildering age of technological sophistication, such traditional games might seem but a quaint throwback for a generation who’ve grown up with computers, tablets and mobile phones.Yet one of my more gratifying experiences has been to witness their miraculous revival among the pupils of Brighton College, a mixed independent school where I am the Head Master.To the surprise of many of them, they’ve become completely absorbed in the intrigue and strategy of games such as Cluedo, Monopoly and Risk, which are teaching them to celebrate their triumphs and accept their setbacks.So why are they playing them at all? Because, back in September, I decided to bring in severe restrictions on the use of mobile phones at school. And the results have been little short of revelatory.With screen and apps no longer so dominant on the premises, the attention of the pupils has turned elsewhere — and some of it has focused on those board games.Of course, we knew there would be a void to fill in the absence of mobiles, so we invested in a formidable stock of age-old games such as Scrabble, which not only engage the brain far more aggressively than addictive computer video games such as Candy Crush, but, just as importantly, promote social interaction. What the experiment has taught me and the pupils is just how much of a hold smartphones have over society — and just how liberating it can be to switch them off.What’s remarkable is how the benefits of the mobile phone ban can be seen in so many ways within the school.There is more interest in sport and drama, less in social media and selfies. It is infinitely preferable to see a 12-year-old with a cricket bat in his hand than a mobile phone.Pupils are also finding they enjoy actual conversations in the real world, instead of being hooked on superficial exchanges in the virtual one.Take away the phones and you take away the negative reason for pupils not to talk to each other. Just as pleasingly, we have seen an increase in reading. The school librarian has told me that the number of books being taken out by pupils has risen sharply since the ban was introduced.I don’t want to sound authoritarian or anti-technology. The mobile phone is one of the great innovations in mankind’s physical progress, transforming communications, commerce and entertainment.But, like all inventions, its use has to be handled responsibly. And in schools, there can be a significant downside to unrestricted access to mobiles.Fears state students could be \u0027shut out of top universities\u0027...JAN MOIR: Why we must ban phones in school now...whatever...Mobile phone entrepreneur John Caudwell in Lyme disease...Share this articleHaving one to hand makes it harder to concentrate, and harder to sleep well, too. Mental health can be undermined by the relentless pressure of social media, reflected in the neurotic obsession with not missing any tweet or text, no matter how trivial.One American study found that 50 per cent of children say they are addicted to their phones, while 80 per cent admit they check their devices at least every hour.Then there’s the darker side: the mobile phone can be an instrument for both bullying and classroom disruption.Although poor behaviour is not a problem at Brighton, I have been told by teachers elsewhere about the difficulties of maintaining order in classrooms where phones are allowed, especially when pupils actually film lessons or take photos of the teacher.           Brighton College, where head teacher Richard Cairns says the phone ban has been a massive successThe tolerance of such conduct is a recipe for a disastrous breakdown in respect for staff.Gratifyingly, several leading figures in politics and education are now aware of the harm that can be caused to youngsters by mobile phones.Last week, Matt Hancock, the Culture Secretary, urged schools to ban them on the grounds that they fuel bullying and distract from learning.‘I believe young children don’t need access to social media. They are children, after all. They need to be able to develop their social skills in the real world first,’ Hancock rightly said in a speech to the NSPCC.His call was echoed by Amanda Spielman, the Head of Ofsted, who argued that ‘technology has made the challenge of low-level disruption even worse’, and she supported a mobile ban in schools.If Brighton’s experience is anything to go by, such an approach will be a success.There is nothing cruel or unjust about such toughness. On the contrary, it is more compassionate because it gives pupils the space to learn and grow.Under our policy, day pupils in years seven, eight and nine — that is approximately from ages 11 to 14 — are required to hand in their mobiles to teachers at the beginning of the day. They then collect their phones when they go home, between 4pm or 5pm.Boarders, who make up about 40 per cent of the school roll, are required to follow the same restrictions in these years. In addition, they must hand back their phones at bedtime.Older pupils have fewer restrictions, but those in Year 10 still have to subscribe to three days of ‘detox’ without phones, while those in the year above have one ‘detox’ day.When I first brought in the policy, I was told it would not work. I was warned the pupils would ‘kick off’ because they are so hooked on their mobiles.But nothing of the sort happened. In fact, our pupils welcomed the change because it relieved them of the burden of being online the whole time.They found they had more freedom, more time for contemplation. ‘We don’t miss our phones at all,’ a group of Year 9 pupils told me.The process of learning has been enhanced, which is what other research has discovered. A 2015 study by the London School of Economics found banning phones raised pupils’ test scores by 6.4 per cent.And it’s not just better for their work. Boarders have also experienced better sleep without the online frenzy before they go to bed, a vital factor when young people’s brains are still developing.Crucially, it’s also easier for teachers to spot bullying of pupils, or pupils who are feeling isolated: so much online intimidation and taunting — so bad for teenagers’ mental health — is hidden by cyberspace. All in all, the experiment has been so successful that next year the school is to extend the five-day mobile ban to Year 10 pupils.I believe that one compelling reason why the pupils may have accepted the ban so readily is because today’s pupils are generally conservative with a small ‘c’ — fully focused on making a success of their time at school and happy to be relieved of any obstructions to achieving that success.Every generation rebels against its predecessor, and this one’s rebellion is to be more serious, dedicated and responsible. That is why they work harder, drink far less, take fewer drugs, have greater social awareness and are more orientated towards their careers.That’s why they have accepted the phone ban with good grace, and I only hope other schools across the country have the same idea.The fact is, the pupils will realise how good it is for them only once their smartphones have been put away. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/18/4D96EF9E00000578-0-image-m-10_1529859651638.jpg","title":"Female reporter lectures football fan tries kiss her","story":"    Julia Guimarães was filming to camera when a football fan approached and tried to kiss her\u0027Don\u0027t do this.

Husband and wife Brian and Anne Bailey have spent 28 years transforming their back yard in Wolverhampton          The couple, who were faced with nothing but grass and a few conifers when they moved in, have since ided the 120-foot-long garden up into different sections          The couple have opened up their garden for charity through the National Open Garden Scheme and welcome hundreds of visitors from all over the world on each open day          Visitors from all over the world visit the Bailey\u0027s garden. The couple said one visitor described it as a \u0027Tardis\u0027\u0027We gradually started nibbling away the grass, expanding the borders and removing overgrown conifers, with the idea of iding the garden up into different sections, which couldn\u0027t all be seen at once.\u0027Much of the garden was very dry and shady, so we had to learn how to work with that and one of the solutions was to put interesting garden buildings in the very worst places, where nothing would grow.\u0027Brian loves working with wood and his first effort was the Japanese teahouse in the farthest dark, dry corner of the garden, so the area around that grew into a oriental garden, screened off by large bamboos.\u0027Things really gathered pace when we retired eight or nine years ago. And things then got a bit out of hand and the surprises got more and more surprising.          The rear of the garden in the early 1990s shows the World War Two bunker being transformed into the grotto, one of the first main features of the garden          The rear of the Bailey\u0027s house in the early 1990s is almost unrecognisable to what it is like today  Mr Bailey places shells onto the ceiling of an old World War Two bunker that was transformed into a grotto in their secret garden, with the entrance hidden behind a gothic summerhouse. The couple, right, say they spend hours each day tending to their creation\u0027Brian built a stone folly to link the fernery to the oriental garden and we turned on old underground air raid shelter into a shell grotto, with the entrance hidden behind a gothic summerhouse.\u0027The sunny borders near the house are all colour themed and the paved terrace was reorganised with an open veranda, raised lion\u0027s head fountain and lots of pots and hanging baskets.\u0027Every year we say we won\u0027t do as many baskets and then every year we end up doing even more.\u0027There was lots of trial and error, both in terms of design and planting, but we just learnt as we went along and changed the things that didn\u0027t work.\u0027          The property sits on a quiet cul-de-sac in Wolverhampton, with no sign of what lies in its back garden          The rear of the house has been transformed with a veranda and many different flowers and roses. The patio also works as a tea garden for visitors          The front of the house, which was built in the 1930s has also been transformed with flowers, tress and shrubsThe couple have found a clever way to water the garden by installing large, hidden water tanks, which collect rain water off the roof and distribute it through leaky hoses snaking down the borders.But Mrs Bailey admitted the garden still took hours of pruning and deadheading each day.She said: \u0027We are such plantaholics that the beds are stuffed with plants, so there is no room for weeds, but we have to do a lot of refereeing, to save the shyer plants from the bullies.\u0027Managing the trees, so they don\u0027t overwhelm the garden, also requires constant vigilance, as does the ongoing battle with slugs and snails.\u0027One visitor said ours was a Tardis garden - bigger on the inside than the outside and another even claimed to be lost once.\u0027We wanted to create a garden that has something unexpected around each corner and we seemed to have done that.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084e7e68c6de5edd353c2a2477ea8fdca85ceae6/0_662_4186_2513/master/4186.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b1fa327b19dafaadd06e09d98a4a084","title":"the big picture laura henno outremonde","story":"In the heart of the California desert, the photographer and film-maker Laura Henno immersed herself in Slab City, a vast, apocalyptic, open-air squat, symbolic of the flipside of the “American dream”.Here, members of an almost exclusively white underclass – the excluded, the poor and those riddled with debt, drugs and drink – live without running water, sewers or electricity apart from the little they can generate with solar panels.In this photograph, Revon, 21, who occupies half of the battered, bullet-riddled bus with her 55-year-old mother (the other half is occupied by a couple with two children), meets Michael, 27, a former marine and Iraq veteran who has recently arrived in Slab City.Henno, whose first film, Koropa, followed people smugglers and migrants on the Comoros and won awards when released in 2016, specialises in documenting the lives of those who have fallen through the social net.

So the perfect person to write it, she decided, was her best friend, Yomi Adegoke, then also 22 and working at Channel 4. “Because Yomi’s a\u0026nbspjournalist, I thought she would write it and I would market it,” says Uviebinené. “But she sold the idea back to me to both write it together.”So that’s what they did. It did not matter that they were both working long hours in highly competitive careers – they wrote every evening and weekend for the next year. Nor that neither had written a book before – they simply Googled “how to write a book” and set up focus groups with friends to discover the breadth of what they needed to research.Taking the dictum to work twice as hard to get half as far as their white counterparts – which they believe is one of the only ways for black communities to succeed in Britain – they secured a book deal a year later, despite the outrageous odds against two black women with no inside connections to an overwhelmingly white, elitist publishing industry.It was not just any book deal either. Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible is arguably the book for 2018, fought for in a nine-way publishers’ auction with Uviebinené and Adegoke receiving – to their astonishment – a five-figure sum.Uviebinené was at work when she got the phone call from her agent. She hid in the office loos and made a breathless call to Adegoke. “I was trying to Whatsapp Yomi from the top of Canary Wharf tower, trying to explain what had just happened and I felt so overwhelmed.”Adegoke was celebrating her 25th birthday in Rio de Janeiro. “I had just broken up with a boyfriend and I wanted to go away after one year of working intensely. I was having a really great time and I’d lost my phone for the previous few days.”Both are 26 now. They met as 18-year-old freshers at the University of Warwick. There they found themselves marooned and misunderstood in an almost uniformly white environment that seemed unconsciously hostile. Adegoke took a year out from Warwick after suffering from depression (she turned this into a productive experience by founding a magazine titled Birthday).“Her confidence was mistaken for arrogance,” explains Uviebinené. “It was ‘us’ against everyone else.”“Yeah,” adds Adegoke, “We’ve both been through a lot. It’s one of the reasons we get on so well. There is a lot of respect there.”Both are of Nigerian heritage – Uviebinené’s father came to Britain when she was two (leaving behind her mother, from whom she is estranged) and she is the eldest of six children. Adegoke was born and raised in Croydon, south London, and has two sisters to whom she is very close. Uviebinené has become a kind of third sister: she moved in with Adegoke’s family in 2016 and has lived there since.The book looks at the mechanics of succeeding at school and in the workplace within a greater system that is structurally tilted against British black communities (they back this up with a barrage of statistical research). In it, they talk of the “concrete ceiling”, “impenetrable glasshouses”, the “long, back-door route into success” and of such flagrant bias at work that some black candidates have fared better by sending in job applications using aliases.They grapple with issues around health, dating and representation that are specific to black female experience. What is most impressive is the book’s penetrating research as well as its argument. “Well, if you are going to call a book ‘the black girl bible’, you have to do your research, and incorporate the full cross-section of black women’s concerns,” says Uviebinené.Adegoke nods vigorously. “In the past year and a half, our lives have been dedicated to making sure we get this right. It’s been the most challenging thing we’ve ever done. I don’t know that I would have a book deal without Elizabeth.”“We are each other’s champions,” Uviebinené shoots back. “Yomi is one of the most confident and articulate people I know.”There are many such tender exchanges. They are friends who seem more like sisters, though in temperament they are yin and yang. Uviebinené turns up bang on time and is calmly composed and earnest. Adegoke, who arrives late, is a whirlwind of energy. They do not talk over each other or finish each other’s sentences but seem to know what the other will say. Much of this sisterliness and fierce spirit of “strength in adversity” is channelled into their book. Uviebinené says it was written for her younger self, and all those girls and women who, like her in those formative years, are trying to figure out who they are in the world, and how they can succeed at life. “When I was 16, I’d write notes to myself every time things got hard on the type of person I wanted to be. I was always looking to what life held for me. So this book is about what I wanted to know when I was 16, and 18, and 21, that popular culture wasn’t telling me.” It also gives young black girls a host of role models or “cheerleaders” that the authors believe are badly needed. They interview 39 accomplished black women for their perspectives on success, from Malorie Blackman to Laura Mvula, June Sarpong, Denise Lewis, Jamelia, Margaret Busby and Estelle. Young girls need to “see it to be it”, they say, quoting Dr Karen Blackett, chair of MediaCom, from the book’s foreword, and such cheerleaders were not always visible while they were growing up.Uviebinené found inspiration in older women who accomplished great things, while for Adegoke, it came from closer to home. “My older sister, Yemisi, is a journalist for BBC Africa. She always told us dark skin was beautiful. She made sure we didn’t have issues around it. She was like a third parent, making sure we grew up confident.”Since Uviebinené’s lightbulb moment in 2015, the subject of ersity has exploded in publishing. Bestselling books by Reni Eddo-Lodge and Afua Hirsch have shown the industry that there is an immense appetite for a conversation around race and inequality in Britain.What do they feel about this moment? “Liz was trying to set the agenda, not follow it,” says Adegoke. “So we didn’t think: ‘This will work because black girls have traction right now.’”But they welcome the drive for better representation. “We see it as a blessing that our book has coincided with a trend for ersity,” says Adegoke. “We can see that just as it is in fashion now it can fall out of fashion. But then again, black women are not going anywhere. We don’t fall off the planet when we’re not in fashion. We’ll still here and we believe we’ve written a good book, and that people will read it, even if people get bored of ersity.”Is it relevant to non-black readers, too, and inspiring girls across the range? “I think non-black people should read it to understand the experience of what it means to be a black woman. I have been reading books that have not been written for me all my life,” says Adegoke.For Uviebinené, intersectionality is key in feminism: “You can sing from one voice but it’s also not as straightforward as that. You need to see your privilege for what it is first. Feminism for me is about gaining choices and breaking down the insidious structures that hold us back. White women tend to want to be more like white men in their privilege. I don’t want to be more like white women.”Do they think unequal structures are slowly being broken down, and that Britain is changing? After all, a mixed-race woman recently married into royalty. “I don’t think Meghan Markle massively marked a change. It’s Harry’s choice, not an institutional choice, though I do think she could be an agent of change for women,” says Adegoke. “But if Harry had brought home a girl who looked like us – black girls with kinky hair and big noses – it would be a very different conversation.”They swap a look again, a kind of signal that they have each other’s backs. What about boyfriends, I ask. Where do they sit within their friendship? “My boyfriend is basically a version of Liz – a short, dark-skinned Taurus.” Does he get on with Uviebinené? Adegoke shrugs as if this is a no-brainer. “They have to love her. Of course.”• Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke will join Afua Hirsch for a  Live event on Wednesday 25 July at Kings Place, London N1• Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible is published next month by Fourth Estate (£16.99).

Her 2011 nonfiction memoir How to Be a Woman is an international bestseller, while How to Build a Girl, the first novel in her semi-autobiographical trilogy about\u0026nbspa teenager called Johanna Morrigan, is being made into a feature film. Its sequel, How to Be Famous, is out on Thursday (Ebury Press, £14.99).This is your third book with a ‘how to’ title. How come?I like writing useful books. I didn’t go to school. Everything I learned was from reading everything that interested me in Wolverhampton’s Warstone’s library. With a “how to” title you know what you’re going to get. If you call it, like, The Crying of Dolphins, people think: “Hmm, is that relevant to me?” Every book of mine is a list of topics I haven’t seen addressed, taboos that need to be busted, secrets that need to be told, things that I want to boggle at. What is everybody else not talking about or too scared to talk\u0026nbspabout?Although your new novel, with its plot about a powerful man sexually exploiting younger women, is very in tune with what everyone’s talking\u0026nbspabout.Yes, imagine sitting here every day and going on Twitter and you’re like: “Shit, this is literally the plot to this book!” I’d had the idea for 10 years. It was always about sexual shame, a tape, and becoming famous for the wrong reasons. When something awful happens and you become news, how do you deal with that? Revenge porn is a huge thing now for younger women.\u0026nbspJohanna realises she needs to speak out. She’s saying: “Take your shame, it’s not mine.” And that was what the #MeToo movement was doing on a global scale. And it’s\u0026nbspworking! These fuckers are going to go to jail, it’s changing the industry.Johanna’s defiance seems to embody that of the #MeToo movement.What’s really important in the book is that Johanna would not be able to get to that defiance if she had not met Suzanne. Her friend Suzanne is older, she’s been through more, and she gives Johanna a platform. This is the thing that’s missing on social media, particularly in activism, it’s all young people with their anger. I wanted to write about female friendships and feminist mentors. We need more of that at the moment with activism. We tend to kill or ignore our tribal elders.Who is your feminist mentor?I loved Germaine Greer growing up – obviously she’s problematic now – but she wasn’t scared and I absolutely couldn’t imagine not being scared. Also when I was 17, Courtney Love took me under her wing – Suzanne is a bit based on her – I interviewed her a couple of times.Your books and your sitcom Raised By Wolves are based on your real life. Do you ever worry that you’ll run out of\u0026nbspmaterial?Within the panoply of fat, clever, working-class girls who really like to shag – I don’t think we’re overserved for those role models yet. Also, teenage girls are a cipher. Their concerns tell you precisely what the problems are with being an adult woman in any era. And right now, one in 10 teenage girls is being referred to mental health services. Girls are rejecting the idea of being an adult woman.Do you think it’s the worst time to be a teenage girl?We’ve heaped a whole load of pressure on these women. My generation had it easy. When I was a teenager the Berlin Wall had come down, we were all taking ecstasy and running around like Pac-Men in nightclubs going “everything’s going\u0026nbspto be great, hooray for liberalism”. We see these things being reversed now: the property and the jobs market have changed, there’s a rise in nationalism and\u0026nbsppopulism. The thing is, the internet foregrounds all of our disagreements and we don’t have anywhere where we see all of our progress. What’s your next book?A sequel to How to Be a Woman. I’m going to do trans issues, caring, mental illness, anxiety, ageing. I’m very excited.And how’s the film adaptation of How to Build a Girl going?It feels like a big fuss to make a film. When you’re writing a script, you’re writing about getting drunk on a bus. Some poor fucker is going to have to find a period-appropriate bus, clear a street, find actors... It’s such a hoo-ha. It’s really mortifying. But it is magic.Were you involved in the casting of Beanie Feldstein (the best friend in Greta Gerwig’s film Lady Bird) as you?Oh yes. The producers hadn’t been truthful with me that the chances of finding a big actress with the range to play a teenager who is clever, unusual and funny, but who’s also big enough to front a movie, were infinitesimal. We tend not to have big actresses, they just look at Hollywood and go, ‘Well there’s no point me being an actress. I’m just going to be the fat, funny friend.’ That she was invented just in time to do this movie is joyful. She’s going to be a huge star. She glows.What’s currently on your bedside table?I’m reading A History of God by Karen Armstrong. I’m working on a couple of projects where I look at the origins of God. Why did we invent\u0026nbspthis guy? And what’s his relevance now?Is there an author that you always return to?I reread The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole pretty much every year. It’s extraordinary. It’s that thing you see so often in female writers – Nina Stibbe’s another one – to write something light, brilliant and frothy is incredibly hard. It’s like making bread: you have to knead that fucking dough for a long time to make it light as a feather. Anyone can write a serious, miserable book.What book might people be surprised to find on your bookshelf?If they saw how badly I spelled, they’d probably be surprised that I have a dictionary. I still don’t really know\u0026nbspanything about grammar or\u0026nbspspelling.And they’re big on grammar at school these days.It breaks my heart. Some of my stuff is set texts at GCSE and A-level, so I get kids saying: “We’re analysing you today, why have you used a past participle there?” And I literally don’t have a clue. I learned to write by reading. I tell my kids there’s probably something in this house that will be more use to you than the stuff you’re learning at school.Are they fans of your work?No! Who wants to read their mum writing about masturbation? We did an Easter egg hunt and one of the clues was hidden in my book and they refused to open it. The shits.

Last year, it made profits of £67.4m in what it described as a disappointing year, against £83.5m in 2016.Countrywide wants to cut its debts of £192m by at least half by raising extra capital. It said its largest shareholder, the private equity firm Oaktree, and its lenders were backing the plans.Peter Long leads the company as executive chairman after the chief executive, Alison Platt, who had run the firm since 2014, resigned days after the January profit warning. He announced a “back to basics” recovery plan in March, which included cutting head office staff numbers by a third, the equivalent of 150 jobs.Many senior staff have left in recent years as a result of Countrywide’s decision to shut 200 branches and merge its lettings and sales businesses, hitting its mid-market London business in particular. Under Platt, the group was centralised and branch managers lost the autonomy to recruit, market locally and to price to win business.Long, the former boss of Europe’s largest travel firm Tui, is seeking to reverse these moves and reshape the group by empowering regional and branch managers. He has called for senior branch staff who left during the Platt years to come back. Demand in the property market has been hit by higher stamp duty and Britain’s vote to leave the EU two years ago. House prices have been falling in London and parts of southern England, but are still rising elsewhere in the UK.Countrywide said there was no update on the search for a new chief executive. Long has been criticised for the number of boardroom positions he holds. As well as running Countrywide, he is deputy chairman of Tui, and chairman of Royal Mail and and Spanish leisure park operator Parques Reunidos Servicios Centrales. He is also president of the Family Holiday Association.Henry Pryor, an independent luxury property buying agent, tweeted: “Hapless @CountrywideUK looks to tap up investors to bail out a business that has been driven into the ground by incompetent management.

The tribunal ruling, in Leeds, means the 65 workers are entitled to employment rights and to receive the national minimum wage and holiday pay. The GMB described it as a landmark ruling that would potentially apply to other Hermes couriers, around 14,500 of whom are employed under the same contracts. Tim Roache, the GMB general secretary, said: “This is yet another ruling that shows the gig economy for what it is: old-fashioned exploitation under a shiny new facade.

Investors have pushed the FTSE 100 to a record high but the index is still only a few hundred points above its 1999 peak, while the Dow Jones is at 24,580 – more than double the level at the turn of the century. “The outlook for the next year may be more mixed. While the pound is expected to remain relatively weak, the prospect of an escalating trade war could hurt a significant proportion of our FTSE non-UK 50 constituents,” she said. “These companies are also potentially more vulnerable to a cliff-edge Brexit as they tend to have supply chains that are more deeply integrated with the EU.”Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said the biggest impact was on the retail sector.“The retail sector has come under pressure from higher labour costs, lower footfall and the relentless rise of digital shopping. The currency crunch didn’t cause these issues but it made life more difficult in already tough times for high street retail,” he said.“The best performing stocks since the Brexit vote have a distinctly metallic tint and that’s because mining companies have profited from a combination of lower sterling and higher commodity prices.”More broadly, UK investors have tended to buy shares in continental stock markets and New York.“Investors have been putting record amounts into funds of late but they have been pulling considerable chunks of money out of the UK. Since the EU referendum was announced, £7.9bn has been withdrawn from UK equity funds against a backdrop of £61bn being ploughed into investment funds more generally,” Khalaf said.“Particular flashpoints for withdrawals from UK equities occurred around the time of the referendum and the general election the following year, which suggests the investor exodus from the UK has been very much driven by political uncertainty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/833d806774383b54a8ad58a8e164d5853a881061/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea8e9d457df92e3d0e7f209b6f8607c3","title":"the ultimate character test do you thank the bus driver","story":"A new meme hails ‘people who thank the bus driver’ as the best of humanity - even Russell Crowe approves. But does everyone agree?You’ve hit the red stop button, the bus is slowing to a halt, the doors lurch open with a hiss, you go to disembark ... but wait.Do you thank the driver?The question of public transport protocol has become an unlikely meme on social media, alongside claims that it is the ultimate test of character – with those who give voice to their gratitude hailed as “the best of humanity”.According to KnowYourMeme, the meme originated on Reddit two weeks ago, when a user elevated “people who say thanks to the bus driver” to pharaoh status. From Reddit, the meme – reminiscent of so-called “wholesome memes”, a knowing attempt to make the internet a kinder place – spread to other platforms and was applied to various established formats, such as Distracted Boyfriend and Exploding Brain. “People who don’t say thanks to the bus driver” were also condemned.The popular Instagram account Brown Cardigan, followed by nearly 400,000 people, embraced the cause with characteristic near-deranged fervour, collating the best – and increasingly aggressive – expressions of “unrelenting gratitude” under the hashtag: #justthankingbusdriverthings.“WOW. Huge. Memes that change lives and empower everyday heroes. Our job here is done,” read the caption beneath the story, which reported “a whole new sense of job satisfaction” and even an uptick in career change inquiries.Brown Cardigan’s self-appointment as a “conductor of goodwill” may have been facetious, but the meme nevertheless sparked an earnest debate about passenger etiquette.But debate elsewhere on the internet flagged the possibility that the weight of the implicit expectation to thank your bus driver could vary by region.In Australia, where Brown Cardigan is based, a loud “CHEERS DRIVER” or exaggerated nod of thanks is de rigeur on alighting the bus, in the smaller cities of Brisbane and Perth in particular, but not infrequently in Sydney.His tweet caught the attention of Gladiator actor and lively tweeter Russell Crowe, who agreed, adding: “It’s simple common courtesy.”But discussion in New Urbanist Memes for Transit-Oriented Teens – a Facebook group of nearly 100,000 mostly millennials interested in urbanist issues – suggested that view was by no means the case elsewhere in the world. Londoners in particular were singled out for scrutiny.One member described thanking the bus driver as “Irish culture”.“I used to thank bus drivers when I lived in a city where that was a thing people did,” wrote one commenter. “For now, I live in a city that mercifully rejects small talk and the forced emotional labor of giving and accepting thanks (New York) – so I no longer do.”Several respondents distinguished between the relative convenience of expressing their thanks while exiting from the front door, and the potentially unseemly volume necessary to be heard from the back.A minority were unapologetically ungrateful. One woman wrote: “I don’t talk to strangers so I don’t thank my bus driver.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0fc269f8e6f69047e28cd1f59e95d0550094484/0_94_2907_1745/master/2907.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f66c0c21d3d6fbb28d9b5b14341c5010","title":"trans equality class struggle obsessive arguments boundaries identity","story":"Prejudice – much of it unconscious – makes employers less likely to hire a trans person. The fact that policing and teaching are specific areas where people don’t trust us is telling – in the public psyche, these are both considered positions of authority. It’s certainly easy to wonder if the persistent misrepresentation of trans people as deluded or deceitful has infected the minds of those who quietly decide not to hire them.Even when trans people are able to be out in work, not all the work available to them is good. I still remember the first time I ever knowingly spoke to a trans woman. I was about 20 years old. In my summer vacations as a student, I worked in one of the many call centres in my home town of Bristol. It was cold calling: a truly thankless and lowly paid job on a zero-hours contract, where the time you are away from your desk on a toilet break is recorded and, if deemed too long, flagged to a manager who sternly tells you to urinate more quickly in future.The office demographic was unlike anywhere else I have worked, in that two minority groups were overrepresented: visibly trans women, and women from Bristol’s Somali community. A customer service role where you didn’t have to face the customer in a wig or a hijab was no doubt a common incentive for both sets of women, who are also over-represented in Bristol’s hate crime statistics In the end, I was caught smoking by a manager during work time and simply never offered any more hours – employers can in effect “sack” you with impunity when you’re on such a precarious contract. For the trans women I worked alongside, I can’t imagine it was easy to get time off for critical medical appointments, which are handed down on high from the NHS gender identity clinics with little room for negotiation.Physical transition is expensive and traps trans people in a vicious circle – the more you look like society’s idea of an acceptable or conforming man or woman, the more likely you are to get employment opportunities. But to achieve this appearance usually requires subsidy. The NHS does offer up to eight sessions of free laser hair removal on your face – but only after languishing on a waiting list for anything up to two years. I didn’t wait, and needed about 20 sessions it cost me well over a thousand pounds. I paid because I knew that if I didn’t have a beard shadow, street harassment would diminish and employment prospects would increase. It worked. Most trans people are not middle-class writers, however, and most are not able to move in with family for long stretches as I did to help finance my transition.Instead, the answer for many is sex work. Too much of mainstream British feminism is still stuck in a self-righteous paroxysm of disgust to seriously consider sex work a form of labour. Yet it is labour in which the workers have no legal protection, and no union – and they risk criminal prosecution, as well as putting their own personal safety at risk, to earn money. In the trans community particularly, sex work has become a necessary, if precarious, financial lifeline for those who have been frozen out of the labour market. Sex worker emancipation and trans politics are intimately connected – not because sex work is “empowering” but because they overlap in their analysis of labour relations, workplace safety and dignity. Both movements demand better healthcare, less social stigma, fairer distribution of public resources and evidence-based policy.The trans movement is easily infantilised as amounting to the whinges and navel-gazing of trendy middle-class students who have OD’d on Judith Butler. But the idea that trans equality is a kind of middle-class liberalism, a luxury unconnected to the “real” politics of class and labour, is a media myth. Class is determined by your ownership of assets or capacity for acquiring them. The vast majority of trans people in the UK score low on both counts – they are by definition working class and have little agency over whether they can sell their labour, the kind of labour performed or the conditions in which they work.To move forward, trans liberation must be recognised as a class struggle as well as a feminist and anti-racist endeavour. The time for vicious and obsessive arguments about the boundaries of identity has passed.• Shon Faye is a writer, artist and standup comedian"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5c355b1c0e817c9544678d220c33724a79e731b/0_0_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9135f4050a9757c2feca61d9d4b2c1a5","title":"where is jeremy corbyn rose tinted vision labour past","story":"Labour must stop talking in terms of 1945 and all that, and engage with today’s big issues – Brexit foremost among themThe best politicians inspire, but part of their job is also to orientate: to survey an often confounding set of national circumstances, and tell us not just where we all are, but also what our position means and where we need to go next. A year on from that remarkable general election result, this is the challenge facing Jeremy Corbyn and the people at the top of the Labour party – a difficult but urgent task in increasingly trying times.Just over a week ago, I was among the 3,000 or so people who spent an overcast Saturday in north London,\u0026nbspat the celebration of politics and music branded\u0026nbsp Labour Live. Whatever its detractors claimed, it was a well-intentioned, creative event – but the sparse crowd and rather wearied atmosphere highlighted issues far beyond the organisers’ control.Notwithstanding the passions that occasionally coursed around the site, the day reflected the inertia that has set in on both the right and left since last year’s election – and more specifically, Labour’s current lack of energy and big ideas, which was never more evident than when Corbyn took the main stage in the early evening and delivered his big speech.It was essentially an oration I have heard many times before, in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Over an uneven, often apparently improvised half-hour with no discernible beginning, middle or end, he tumbled through homelessness, the need to “take the commodity out of education”, the mounting mental health crisis, and more. Brexit got the briefest of mentions, 20 minutes in. The tenor often sounded more despairing than optimistic. Potentially powerful lines were often mangled by verbal tics (“as a society” is a phrase that urgently needs to go). There was a lack of any real story about the current condition of Britain with the kind of coherence and emotional lift that might speak to the people who are yet to be convinced.For sure, Labour has a set of entirely justified moral convictions. Thanks chiefly to the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, it has the beginnings of an across-the-piece economic plan, and some very interesting ideas about making the country more equal from the roots up. But what the party doesn’t yet possess is an account of the last few turbulent years of British history, and any human, emotional story about what the country might look like if it gets to implement its programme. So when its big figures get to their punchlines, there are often only empty bromides. “We want to live in a world where there is decency, and above all, hope,” said Corbyn – which was very nice, but floated off into the air as soon as he had said it. The usual questions remained unanswered: What is the United Kingdom? Why should it hold together? Where has it been, and where is it going? And as well as all the despair, where are the spots of hope that point to a different kind of country?Such, perhaps, are the perils of attempting to make political headway while maintaining a stubborn reticence about the biggest change the UK has faced since the second world war. Right now, politics begins and ends with Brexit: the current Labour habit of talking about the past, present and future as if leaving the EU is a tangential subplot simply doesn’t make sense. But that is what the leadership does, having concluded that, as the government tumbles into shambles after shambles, the best thing to do is sit the whole mess out and say as little as possible. It is some achievement that many leavers think Corbyn is a remainer, while remainers are split between those who think he is secretly one of them, and those who damn him as a hardcore Brexiteer. This in turn blurs into a wider sense of paralysis and confusion – not a good look for an opposition that may go into a general election much sooner than some people think.In some alternative universe, there might be a Labour party that began making the case for single-market membership in the summer of 2016, and whose leader was the star speaker at the weekend’s People’s Vote march. But as evidenced by those irate chants of “Where’s Jeremy Corbyn?”, he and his allies resolutely believe that talk of another referendum is for the birds, and we have to leave the European Union – albeit with a secure deal, a transition period, a customs union, and maintained protections for workers’ rights and the environment. Given where Labour stands in relation to many of its own voters, that is a reasonable position. Indeed, when anti-Brexit protesters at Labour Live unfurled their “stop backing Brexit” banner during Corbyn’s speech, he should have thought on his feet, and restated it. Instead he kept stumm and some of his media outriders then tried to paint the disrupters as craven lackeys of the establishment (something proved, apparently, by the fact they have an office in Millbank Tower). Once again, what we missed was a clear, confident, consistent Labour narrative.The cleverest radicals tend to present their ideas as matters of modesty and common sense, so as to accomplish one of politics’ most overlooked imperatives: the necessity of reassurance. Beyond Brexit, that also ought to apply to large swathes of Labour policy. Whatever the factional tensions, one point needs to be made again and again: that as well as being a newly revived movement, Labour is also a political force steeped in knowledge and experience, and is successfully running all of England’s big cities. Maybe Corbyn and McDonnell are wary of comparisons with soggy European social democracy, but if their ambitious plans for regional investment banks are similar to what exists in Germany, that point ought to be made every time the policy is mentioned. If Corbyn wants to create a school system that isn’t built around incessant testing and league tables, he might point out that some of the most successful European countries offer lessons in how to do it.There are big areas of policy – defence and foreign affairs, chiefly – that the left tends to ignore, but (and I’m being somewhat diplomatic here) which still sit between Labour and the voters it will need if it’s going to win. Perhaps most importantly, the party should stop framing its policies in terms of a return to the pre-Thatcher past – 1945 and all that – and start basing what it says in the future. It ought to be Tory free-marketry that feels like yesterday’s thing.If Labour does not yet have the collective capacity or inclination to do these things, the reason is not hard to identify. Beyond the union-funded Centre for Labour and Social Studies (aka Class), the Corbynites have no supportive thinktanks. The online noise surrounding their project tends to be about either the necessity of campaigning or factional battling, so questions of strategy and ideas tend to get lost. Put another way, the foundations of the new Labour party in Twitter and Facebook mean that many of its followers have become well-versed in the art of online shouting, but less used to discussing the challenges Labour faces. A little too much attention, perhaps, is paid to “melts”, centrist dads, and not enough to the difficult questions that political parties with their eyes on power always have to face.Six weeks before Labour Live I was in Walsall, one of those large post-industrial, leave-voting towns – see also such places as Nuneaton, Derby, Mansfield and Dudley – where Labour seems to be falling behind. I watched the Tories gain council seats, and even Labour voters talked\u0026nbspabout the party in puzzled, stand-offish terms. Opinion pollsters may or may not be centrist stooges, but it also might be worth bearing in mind that a recent YouGov survey suggested that between January and May this year, there was a seven-point swing from Labour to the Tories among working-class voters. It would be easy to frame such things in terms of the message not getting through.But in parts of the country a long way from north London, Labour’s predicament might come down to something much more fundamental: what is that message in the first place?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e31c804c66480ca61fc359d62f144f95893e244c/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5be88aad7c486ab090266f4b1d7c966e","title":"hereditary horror film history cult rosemarys baby","story":"A secret bunch of malign old people are behind some of the greatest atrocities in horror film history – so much so that the cult may have blown its coverHorror aficionados may have guessed where things were heading with Hereditary early on. First there was that strange symbol on the dead\u0026nbspmother’s necklace, then there was her strange book on spiritualism with a note inside. Toni Collette packs the book into a box as if to say: \u0026nbsp“I’m sure this will be of no significance to whatever weird, supernatural occurrences ensue.” Wrong!As magnificently terrifying as Hereditary is, once the panic dies down, the conclusion feels a little familiar. It’s the cult! It’s always the cult! Invariably when it comes to these kinds of horror movies, the perpetrators turn out to be a secret bunch of malign old people. They are overwhelmingly white, they worship demons, they hold powerful positions in society, they enjoy being naked. But unlike the Republican party, they prefer to stay behind the scenes – at least until the end of the third act. You could think of them as a\u0026nbspsatanic deep state.This cult has engineered some of the greatest atrocities in horror history. Hereditary knows its heritage. It’s clearly indebted to Rosemary’s Baby, in which Mia Farrow’s respectable neighbours turn out to be a similar cabal of evil wrinklies, pulling the strings of her nightmare pregnancy.That was 50 years ago, and as you would expect of an organisation preoccupied with lineage, the cult has successfully perpetuated itself through the ages. Also in 1968, robed devotees were summoning Baphomet on Salisbury Plain in Hammer classic The Devil Rides Out. In 1977, they were operating behind the front of a German dance academy in Dario Argento’s Suspiria (a remake of which is on the way), and by Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut (1999) they had scaled up to masked orgies in posh country houses.Has the cult now blown its cover? It’s all over the place: from Get Out, where it disguised itself as white country liberals, to Ben Wheatley’s Kill List, where they were straw-masked, torch-bearing pagans, possibly descendants of The Wicker Man’s islanders. In Martyrs they were a secret society of philosophers in The Witch, a coven of crones hiding in the woods (and getting naked).Depending on how you look at it, this current tipping of the cult’s hand could reflect a\u0026nbspgenerational paranoia, a warning to today’s youth to beware of their elders, especially the naked ones. Or it could be an indication that, despite horror’s bracing new guises, the same old ideas lie underneath. As Keyser Söze might have put it after an all-night horror binge, the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the next generation they were watching something new. Either way, if you read reports of my mysterious death in a freak shaving accident in the coming months, know that the cult is real, and it has silenced me.

Eighteen nations are in contention for the 10 places left up for grabs in the last 16 – and in Group F potentially any of the four teams could still qualify.Already qualified for second round: Russia, Uruguay, France, Croatia, England, BelgiumRussia and Uruguay have both qualified. A draw on Monday and Russia top the group on goal difference. Uruguay need to win to take the group.A draw will be enough to guarantee Portugal progress, though Iran can qualify for the second round for the first time if they can beat Portugal. Spain are almost certain to progress unless Iran beat Portugal and Spain lose to Morocco by a wider margin.Croatia are through. Argentina, Iceland or Nigeria could all join them in the next round. A draw against Argentina will be enough for Nigeria, provided that Iceland don’t beat Croatia. Iceland need Argentina and Nigeria to draw, and then if they can beat Croatia by two goals or more they can just about edge out Nigeria. Argentina need to win, and hope Iceland don’t beat Croatia. If Iceland and Argentina both win, it would come down to goal difference between the pair. Get the abacus out.Brazil, Switzerland and Serbia are in contention for the two places. Switzerland know they need only a point against Costa Rica to progress. Serbia need victory against Brazil to be sure of going through – a result which would potentially send the Seleção home early if Switzerland also get a positive result.Germany’s sensational last-minute winner against Sweden has made this one of the most complex group situations – Mexico and South Korea could join either of those teams in the last 16. Mexico are in the box-seat with six points - a point against Sweden and they are through. Sweden need a better result against Mexico than the result Germany get against South Korea to progress. South Korea can still edge through if they beat Germany and Mexico beat Sweden, and there’s at least a two-goal margin in there somewhere.There’s also a bizarre edge in this group, whereas if South Korea beat Germany 1-0, and Mexico beat Sweden 1-0, the rules state that Sweden and Germany will only be separated by their disciplinary records – not by the fact that Germany beat Sweden.England and Belgium are locked together at the top of the group, both guaranteed to progress. Their final match will determine who tops the group. As they have identical records so far, if their final match is drawn, the team with the better disciplinary record (currently England with two yellow cards as opposed to Belgium’s three) will top the group. If they end up with identical disciplinary records, lots will be drawn to decide who finishes first – which could be key to potentially avoiding a route that includes facing Germany or Brazil in the quarter-finals.Japan will progress if they get at least a draw against eliminated Poland. Colombia and Senegal face each other. A draw in that game will be enough for Senegal to progress. A draw might also be enough for Colombia to progress, but they would be relying on Poland beating Japan at the same time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63798d60382d7337b7b9b9d797b2853733af8a85/0_252_6312_3788/master/6312.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e86286025aa6945c24c9bf73c20e2f86","title":"iran women fans attending matches world cup russia","story":"Campaigners against a ban on female fans in Iran going to games have taken their battle to Russia where they watched their team’s second match despite invasive security checksWhen Iran take on Portugal in Saransk on Monday night, there will be a group of Iranian fans in the stadium who have not been allowed to watch games back home in Iran for decades: women.The World Cup in Russia has provided a chance for a few of Iran’s female football fans to do what hardline religious authorities at home have not permitted them to do since the 1979 revolution, and has also led to female fans back in Tehran being allowed to watch a live transmission of the team’s second game against Spain, suggesting that the ban on female attendance may soon be lifted.However, two fans who are in Russia running a campaign to have women allowed into stadiums back home say they were targeted and harassed by Russian authorities before Iran’s match with Spain last week.For Sara, who travelled to the tournament from Iran and is using an assumed name to avoid identification by Iranian authorities, her country’s opening match against Morocco in St Petersburg was the first time she had been to a football game. “I’ve watched lots on television but this was so different I felt like I had stepped into the television set and everything had become 3D,” she said. “I didn’t really know how to cheer, because I’ve never been inside a stadium.”Sara is one of the founders of the Open Stadiums movement, which campaigns for women to be allowed in to watch games. She has been battling on the issue since 2005. The experience of finally making it to an Iran game was a happy one, especially given their 1-0 win over Morocco, albeit with a late own goal, but she also said she felt sad at the symbolism of the occasion. “It was our dream for years, and it turns out it’s just such a simple thing to have a stadium packed with happy people.”In Tehran, Iran matches at the World Cup are screened at the city’s Azadi Stadium. The Morocco game there was open only for men, but the Spain game was open to women too, after an on-and-off situation where women with tickets were first sent home and later told they would be able to attend after all, reflecting the isive nature of the topic among Iran’s ruling elite. It was the first time since 1979 that female fans had been allowed to watch a football match inside the stadium.While the Spain game was a first for female fans back home, those in Russia had problems at the match, held in Kazan. Maryam Qashqaei Shojaei, an Iranian woman who left Iran a decade ago, held up a banner during the Morocco game with the slogan: “Support Iranian women to attend stadiums #NoBan4Women”.All banners have to be photographed, translated and cleared by Fifa in the days before a game, and Shojaei said she had done this with hers and received a printed confirmation together with a photograph of the banner that showed it had been allowed. At the first game, in St Petersburg, there were no problems and she was able to enter the stadium with the banner.In Kazan, things were different. When she tried to take the banner into the stadium, she was told by security staff she would have to wait for clearance, and was then told it was not possible. Outside the ground, she noticed two men in plain clothes were following her and would approach people she tried to ask for help.“I must have talked to 17 or 18 people at different gates,” she said. “They all started out being friendly and helpful, and then these two guys would come and say something to them in Russian and they would just turn away and say they can’t help.”When she entered the stadium, the arguments over the banner continued, and she was subjected to a thorough search of her person and possessions by stadium security and police. “They searched my bag, and behaved as if they had finally caught a serial killer,” she said. She eventually decided to take her banner and leave, but was told it had been thrown away. She finally made it into the ground, without the banner, about 30 minutes after the game had started.Sara, too, was targeted for a thorough, invasive body search in a private room, which she said was a “humiliating and uncomfortable” experience. “This is the first serious case of an invasive body search we have recorded since the beginning of the tournament,” said Ronan Evain, director of Football Supporters Europe, an organisation providing support to the Iranian female fans. “It was performed by a single officer and with the clear intention to establish a climate of pressure.”Given this, it seems likely that the search was not random. “She is not a public figure, she was not entering the stadium with a banner, and yet she was targeted by security forces,” Evain said. “This raises questions on how she could have been identified.”After Fifa got involved, the banner was recovered from the local police in Kazan and will be returned to Shojaei before Iran’s final group game with Portugal, in Saransk on Monday night. An Iran victory in the game would see the team progress to the next round.Before the tournament Shojaei launched an online petition calling on Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, to put pressure on Iran over the issue. Infantino said in May that he had received assurances from Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, that the ban would soon be lifted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f757e06d470b566ca4226dd27c0bc2a31d9c2001/0_9_3820_2293/master/3820.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=874e296940d23b12b32dabbb05e96db4","title":"mikel john obi lionel messi nigeria argentina world cup","story":"Nigeria v Argentina has rich World Cup history and this meeting falls more than a decade after the captains met in a youth finalMikel John Obi smiles. “Yeah, Messi stole the Golden Ball off me,” the Nigeria captain says, and he remembers how it happened as if it were yesterday. The story comes from the World Youth Championship of 2005, when Mikel drove Nigeria to the final, where they faced a Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina.“Before the game people said that I was going to win the Golden Ball for being the player of the tournament,” Mikel says. “But then Messi scored twice, both of them penalties, Argentina won 2-1 and I got the Silver Ball. Messi has kept on stealing awards from me!”Cue more laughter. The serious point is that Messi has been messing with Nigeria and Mikel for too long. Indeed, Argentina have held an Indian sign over Nigeria at World Cups going back to 1994, when the African nation first qualified.Nigeria are contesting their sixth World Cup and it is a remarkable detail that they have been drawn to face Argentina at the group stage in all but one of them.In 1994 they lost 2-1 to a pair of Claudio Caniggia goals in a game that saw the biggest bang come afterwards, when Diego Maradona failed a drugs test, was sent home and banned. He would never play for Argentina again. Nigeria suffered 1-0 defeats in 2002 and 2010, on the back of goals from Gabriel Batistuta and Gabriel Heinze respectively, and in 2014 they lost 3-2.Mikel played in that game, having missed 2010 through injury, and so did Messi, who scored twice. Messi had also played in 2010 and he was a star of the Argentina team that won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when they beat Nigeria in the final, with Ángel Di María scoring the only goal.Nigeria can point to the 1996 Atlanta Games, when they beat Argentina 3-2 in the final. That team were from the golden age of Nigerian football and featured Kanu, Jay-Jay Okocha and Sunday Oliseh, among others. Emmanuel Amunike scored a stoppage-time winner. The triumph is fondly remembered but, in terms of tournament successes against Argentina, it stands in glorious isolation.Mikel and his teammates are determined to break the World Cup jinx when they take on Argentina in Tuesday’s Group D finale in St Petersburg and it has the ingredients of the most decisive meeting between the countries yet.Nigeria know that after the 2-0 win over Iceland, another victory would ensure qualification to the last 16 while a draw would be enough as long as Iceland do not beat Croatia by a couple of goals. Even then Nigeria could go through on goals scored. For Argentina, the equation is simple. Only a win would keep their hopes alive.The subplots are numerous and mouthwatering and yet Messi, inevitably, feels like the central figure. His travails against Iceland and the horror-show loss to Croatia have been well-documented but Mikel knows better than to view him as anything other than the player he and his teammates must stop.Nigeria beat Argentina 4-2 in a Krasnodar friendly last November and they draw a measure of strength from the result. But it was significant that Mikel highlighted how Messi had not featured on that occasion.“A certain human being wasn’t playing,” Mikel says. “Actually, is he even a human being? Messi is Messi. He decides games and the last time we met he scored two against us at the Brazil World Cup. Without him, they are definitely less of a team. We can’t put all our attention on Messi but he is the man that we need to stop. Do we have to put somebody to mark him? Maybe yes, maybe no because when you do that you are playing with less balance.”Nigeria played with great balance and purpose against Iceland, when Ahmed Musa scored both of the goals, after the manager, Gernot Rohr, made a tactical change. He abandoned his usual 4-2-3-1 formation and went with 3-5-2.Mikel, who made his name as a defensive midfielder over 10 and a half seasons at Chelsea and plays for Tianjin Teda in China, has typically operated as a No 10 at international level. It was where he played in the opening group tie against Croatia, which Nigeria lost 2-0.Mikel did likewise against Iceland. Rohr started him in the central holding role, although he and the midfielders either side of him – Oghenekaro Etebo and the impressive Wilfred Ndidi – did get up and down the pitch. Rohr will weigh up whether to continue with the approach against Argentina.And so here Nigeria are once again, confronted by the opponents who have become their nemesis. “We knew we would get them,” Mikel says. “I said to a friend of mine: ‘Trust me, Argentina are going to be in the same group as us.’ It’s crazy. I don’t know why but it keeps happening.”Mikel and Nigeria crave a different ending."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e50d56a2fae65e6f1cacddd2747a4b7da69ef83/0_251_4792_2875/master/4792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9654511edd8d30a95ccf6d7c262c2db8","title":"jesse lingard england panama world cup","story":"Tireless midfielder is becoming the grinning symbol of a team that has come to Russia with a strange sense of exuberanceWell, that was fun, in between the painful bits. First, it is necessary to issue the disclaimers. Yes, Panama unravelled like a cheap cigar in Nizhny Novgorod. Faced with England’s excellent first-half movement, they fell apart like a wicker-rimmed hat left to bake in the sun. At times Panama played a genuinely ugly brand of football, hacking and whingeing and spoiling like the bloke you never invite back to the midweek seven-a-side.In between this England performed with incisive, cold-blooded composure to win 6-1 and rack up their highest World Cup score, an unarguable, entirely deserved entry in the tournament history books for this well-drilled and highly mobile team.Albeit they did so against opponents who were often wretched, the poverty of Panama’s play raising questions about the upshot of opening the great competition up to more nations in the chase for cash.It was not just the fouling and moaning. Although it was mainly the fouling and moaning. It was also the self-defeating nature of it all. Panama can play, as they showed here at times. But they came to spoil. Before the World Cup opener in Moscow at least one Russian volunteer could be seen lurking on the main concourse with a sign reading “Free Hugs”. Perhaps Panama should try something similar pre-match just to get it out of their system, so irresistible was the urge to grip and grapple and grasp, a ludicrous pantomime of man-on-man hug-action that led directly to two first-half goals.Enough of that, though. England were the story here, producing the one thing that has been missing in the orderly progress of the last year or so: a ballsy, freewheeling all-out thumping of game but moderate opposition.Harry Kane had a wonderful time when he wasn’t being strangled. This was not one of the classic hat-tricks, comprising two wonderfully ked penalty kicks and a deflection Kane knew nothing about. But he ran off to safety 18 minutes after half-time with five goals in 1.75 World Cup games, equal with Geoff Hurst as England second all-time scorer in the competition, behind Gary Lineker with 10.Kane will take the headlines. But it was a wonderful afternoon also for Jesse Lingard, who will long remember Panama, possibly even after the bruises have faded. Revenge is best served cold. That was never likely to happen for Lingard on an afternoon where the air inside the stadium sat like a steam-cooker, the kind of drowsy, heavy heat that hits you in the chest and sinks down into the lungs.But Lingard did something excellent here, responding to some blunt and painful treatment by running harder, playing with more rather than less verve on the half‑spin in those forward positions and helping to kill the game in the first half.The Nizhny Novgorod Stadium is another Russian mega-drome, beached on its side like an enormous white Wagon Wheel. England’s fans had staked out their upper tiers with a row of flags hanging limp from the railings, the usual tour of the Isles from Bury to Stoke to Southampton and Hull. What followed was glorious reward for all that travel and expense, the post-Marseille anxiety, the constant boisterous support.It was reward, too, for Lingard, who is not the flashiest player nor an obvious star on the stats. Yet he has become one of Gareth Southgate’s reliables, an ever-willing runner with a fine touch and the occasional moment of brilliance.Some have sneered at his fun, extrovert persona, his groovy range of celebrations (there was a little FortniteBlocBoy JB nod here). But look past the tribal stuff and Lingard is also something uplifting: an academy kid living the dream, wringing every last drop of life and joy from a starring role for his boyhood mega-club, now doing the same in front of the world in an England shirt.His first act was to find himself chopped to the floor in the Panama area by an expert short-arm elbow from Gabriel Gómez. Lingard felt his cheek and got on with it. Moments later Armando Cooper dragged him down with the kind of no-you-don’t-son hack familiar to desperate Sunday league players everywhere.England had just taken the lead, John Stones heading in powerfully after a ludicrous triple-tag wrestling bout at a corner had made the space. By which point Gómez had taken it upon himself to follow Lingard everywhere, but he was notably absent as his man sprinted on to Jordan Henderson’s pass and was bundled down by Román Torres and Fidel Escobar in the area. Kane buried the kick.Peak Lingard arrived after 36 minutes, revenge for that throbbing cheek fully realised with a lovely goal to make it 3-0. It was a familiar Lingard move too, a turn and spring, taking the ball in his stride in space and producing a sublime curling shot on the run into the far corner of the net.Stones and Kane scored again. Panama pulled themselves together and were gracious in defeat, Hernán Darío Gómez coming across after half-time to offer warm congratulations to Southgate.For now Kane, Lingard and the travelling support will always have Nizhny Novgorod and a gloriously fun shellacking of a third-tier minnow that still felt significant. Yes, England have yet to play a half-decent opponent here, and could yet bomb out horribly when they do.But who cares, really? Compare this with the paralysing horror, the fear, the constipated style of the last five tournaments. England did not expect. They came to Russia with no real sense of hope, but with a gathering affection for this team and the admirable Southgate. They are already in credit. This was free. This was fun. This was a day that felt like a quiet kind of redemption whatever happens next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b5a995d28abc3e58376165a58d12bf2219ada43/36_36_2484_1490/master/2484.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a334a2aa713aa61366fdfab5b5abed7","title":"ten talking points from the second round of world cup 2018 matches","story":"VAR confounds sceptics, the World Cup shows its capacity to unite, Peru and Egypt go out partying and passions run highThis hasn’t been an easy talking point to write. But maybe, in the end, it’s not you. It’s us. The experience of Video Assistant Refereeing in the English season had only pointed one way at this World Cup. The endless delays while a middle-aged man fiddles with his ear. The jeers in the stadium. The complete absence of any information. It all felt like something that would diminish decisively the primary experience of the stadium-going fan. But in Russia it has actually worked well. A quick sprint off to check a screen. Decisions made in seconds not minutes. Less fussicking and prancing about and super-officious officialdom. VAR has prevented rather than created controversy, and has stilled the tedious chunter about decisions, so often a last resort for those who would rather not analyse the actual game. If it does nothing else World Cup VAR has saved us from the grisly spectacle of Neymar’s backward e against Costa Rica being rewarded with a match-turning penalty. If it makes him stay on his feet just a little more, everyone wins. And meanwhile English football take note. It doesn’t have to be an enormous VAR palaver after all.” Barney RonayThere has been only one other World Cup, in 1966, when England have scored more than their current total of eight goals. Harry Kane has five of them, putting him at the top of the list for the Golden Boot, and meaning Gary Lineker is the only England player in history to have scored more World Cup goals. Yet the strange thing is that Kane’s team-mates have found it unusually difficult to provide him with chances from open play. Two of Kane’s goals have come from penalties, one was a fluke and the other two arrived from corners. That apart, it is difficult to think of a clear chance for Kane. If his team-mates can start picking him out, it may be that the World Cup has not actually seen the best of Kane yet. Daniel TaylorFollowing your team around the globe occasionally conjures wondrous stories of coincidence. Staying at the Oka hotel in Nizhny Novgorod was an England supporter whose mother, recently passed away, hailed from the once-closed city around 250 miles east of Moscow. She had left for north London in 1946 and would never return, with her son having pledged to visit her birthplace in her stead. That England’s schedule would take them back to Nizhny, formerly Gorky, was already a stroke of luck, but the fan had actually discovered, much to his amazement, that the address where his mother had lived was virtually opposite the hotel allocated to him by his travel company. And, what is more, the building is still occupied by someone bearing her maiden name. His next mission is to meet, face to face, the cousin he never knew he had. The football almost felt like a sideshow to the main event. Dominic FifieldHow do you measure your World Cup experience? For the number of countries whose elimination is guaranteed after two games, with no points and in some cases not even a goal to cheer so far, the football side of things clearly can’t have been a highlight. But spending time in the cities where the likes of Egypt and Peru have been out in force to support and represent their nation, there is a tangible sense that they will go home from Russia feeling they’ve had the opposite of a worthless trip. Maybe it has something to do with the length of the wait to experience something like this. It has been 28 years for Egypt and 36 for Peru. Their joy at throwing themselves into the party, their emotions at singing their national anthems and waving their flags, the fervour with which they supported teams as they went out fighting, meant something in itself. Amy LawrenceThere is a school of thought that Neymar was laying it on a bit thick when he burst into tears after Brazil’s late win over Costa Rica but in one sense his lachrymosity was good to see. Whatever you think of the Paris Saint-Germain forward’s solipsism, he is clearly desperate to succeed at a World Cup and it is a counterpoint to any suggestions that this competition does not hold the allure of old to its star participants. “These tears are from happiness, overcoming obstacles, grit and will to win,” he wrote on Instagram after his outburst. What we have seen in the past week and a half – from Neymar’s emotion to Germany’s wild celebrations against Sweden, the pile-ons whenever England score and the atmosphere of intense hostility when Switzerland faced Serbia – is that international football still stirs passions like no other form of the sport. It is easy to get sniffy about some of the quality on show but that is to miss the point that World Cups have always appealed more to the visceral than the cerebral. A group stage full of incident and tension suggests reports of the tournament’s ill health have been exaggerated. Nick AmesGermany will never forget Toni Kroos’s sensational 95th-minute free-kick that sunk Sweden and rekindled their World Cup hopes. But Sweden must move on quickly from the pain, which was compounded by the way that the German bench gloated in the red-raw aftermath of full-time. “It was disgusting behaviour from the Germans, a total lack of respect,” said the midfielder, Emil Forsberg, and he was not the only Swede to offer up emotional sound-bites. Janne Andersson, the manager, was fuming during the post-match melee and he could not keep a lid on it during his press conference. “People behaved in ways that you do not do,” Andersson said. Sweden can still qualify by beating Mexico and their focus has now turned to that. One tip for them – avoid listening to Oliver Bierhoff, who is a member of Joachim Löw’s Germany staff. “The fact is that Sweden’s negative way of playing and so much time-wasting doesn’t deserve to be rewarded,” Bierhoff said. David HytnerThere was more gloating when Switzerland recorded their 2-1 victory over Serbia but this time there was rather more to it. A bit of background. Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka are ethnic Albanians with their roots in Kosovo, where a Serbian crackdown on the Albanian population only ended with Nato military intervention in 1999. Shaqiri was born in Kosovo but his family were forced to flee to Switzerland when he was a baby due to conflict while Xhaka was born in Switzerland – his parents having also fled there from Kosovo. “My uncle’s house burned down and our house was left standing but everything had been stolen or broken and the walls were sprayed,” Shaqiri has said. Xhaka’s father had been a political prisoner for three-and-a-half years, having committed the crime of demonstrating in favour of Kosovarian democratic rights against the communist central government in Belgrade. When Shaqiri and Xhaka scored the goals against Serbia, they made the sign of the Albanian double-headed eagle. Fifa may discipline them for provoking the general public. After what their families lived through, they would surely do it again. DHBy the eternal flame, there is a vast statue of the unknown soldier, stretched prone, his right arm reaching out towards an unseen finish line. About 100 yards away, a gaggle of runners engage in a slightly awkward group warm-up while a terrier called Phoebe scurries about in a frenzy of excitement. This is the Kazan parkrun and, like so much else in Russia this month, the World Cup has made it a little different. Parkrunning is a phenomenon that began in Bushy Park, Teddington, in October 2004. The idea is simple: a timed 5km run on a properly measured course, the ethos being very much about participation rather than competition. It has proved wildly successful, and now stretches to 1,533 parks across 20 countries. A subculture of “parkrun tourists” has developed, as runners “collect” races along various themes. More than 20 runners, for instance, have ticked off all 52 London parkruns, while a recent trend is to try to complete a list of parkruns starting with every letter of the alphabet (apart from X there are no Xs). Zs, understandably, are prized, which is why one visitor from London made the trip to Zhukovsky, about 25 miles from Moscow, on the Saturday before the World Cup began. The Kazan parkrun began in April 2015. It features a brutal hill in the middle of each of its two laps, and attracts an average of 29 runners. On Saturday, there were 38, at least five of them British, including Simon Marland, the secretary of Bolton Wanderers, who came a highly creditable fourth. The week before, there had been around 30 Australians. The local reaction was bemused but welcoming, as the World Cup does its job of bringing different cultures of together. Jonathan WilsonThe front page of Saturday’s Herald Sun wondered “Time for Cahill?” The Australian asked “Forget Wally – where’s Timmy?” After one point and two games in which their only goals have been Mile Jedinak penalties, Australia seems to be losing patience and wants a return to what it knows. And more than anything it knows Tim Cahill. He may be 38-years-old, hasn’t started a game of any description since November and hasn’t scored a club goal since April 2017, but there’s still seemingly a big part of the Australian psyche that can’t let go. Which isn’t a surprise: this is Australia’s fifth World Cup, the first being in 1974 and Cahill has scored in the other three. It must feel weird for him not to be starting. But he’s stayed on the bench for their opening two games and apparently not happy about it either: will the unflaggingly stubborn Bert van Marwijk give in to the clamour? Nick MillerRussia’s 3-1 victory over Egypt put the debate to rest: their defeat of Saudi Arabia wasn’t just a fluke. The Russian team have gelled unexpectedly well, dissecting a flawed Egyptian side that nonetheless boasted a threat in Liverpool star Mo Salah. Behind the winger Denis Cheryshev, the rising star Aleksandr Golovin, and the surprisingly spry Artem Dzyuba, Russians are also joking about it coming home. It’s a sea change from the mood before the World Cup when this side was said to be the worst in the country’s history. And the press let them know it. “I’m a little bit surprised that the national team continued to speak to the media at all because it was a really bad attitude from the press and from the fans,” Igor Rabiner, a popular Russian sportswriter, told me last week. Russia’s first real test, Uruguay, will come on Monday. If the team continues to play as they have, they’ve a fighting chance. And the country will be behind them.

Now Jan Mølby summarising in Danish still with his Scouse accent that sounds strange.”On which point, enjoy this on his lost and found goal against Manchester United by Gregg Bakowski.Lessons for ignoramii: “Spain and Morocco share a land border,” tweets @nikiforenko666, and indeed they do. I am now cognisant of the Melilla fence. How should England go about the Belgium game? My guess is they’ll leave out anyone carrying a knock or on a yellow card, but otherwise will set about it. Here’s Stuart James on Belgium’s weakness out wide.YELLOW TICKER: Sky are now interviewing a child with a John Stones mask on, pretending to be John Stones. For those less well-versed in Portuguese than me, this is Ronaldo asking Iran fans to keep it down, as he’s trying to sleep. Yeah, that’ll work. Sky Sports News have just called Spain v Morocco a “local derby”. Which it almost is: the Straits of Gibraltar are 8.9 miles wide, so I think we’d have to shed the “local”, but otherwise the countries are far closer than, say, Watford and Luton of Fordshire derby fame. I could while away the hours Conferrin’ with the flowers, Consulting with the rain.Alternatively, I could do this, and so could you. “Re Talksport,” emails Christian Storm, “they should be reminded that John Motson literally squeaked his way through his last couple of years commentating and nobody batted an eyelid. Also, I’m very hungover at my desk and accidentally played this clip. Now everybody is looking.”Nah, they were looking at you already and still are. They can taste the self-loathing. “What I don’t get, is how or why some of the players seem to wear long sleeves or even an extra layer under their shirts,” emails Matt Salter.“When I played in AJY U-12s for Barnet Shul, it didn’t matter if there was ice on the ground, our manager made us wear short sleeves with no vests and said that way we would run more to keep warm (he was a nice guy, really was). But these internationals are playing in 30 degrees heat and still some of them with long sleeves and other layers.What’s that about?”I too am an alumnus of the AJY league. I think it was there I developed my passion for beaten teams crying at full-time. As for your question, I wonder if part of it is nipple-protection, and I also think that some of the undergarments offer a circulatory benefit. As we know, marginal gains beat talent and doping every time. So: was Harry Kane’s hat-trick the stuffiest ever scored? Others worthy of a shout: I’m not going to glory such behaviours with a link, but a Talksport presenter with a big, deep, booming baritone has literally been allowed on breakfast telly to say that women’s voices are too high-pitched to commentate on football matches. If ever you hear nonsense of this ilk, it is your duty to shut it down. Women have to fight harder for less, especially in football – consider some of the male types in our media, how unhard they appear to work and how good-1 they are at what they do – and remember that expertise is expertise. Celebrate that, finally, we’re correcting ourselves, know that football is for everyone in every aspect, and challenge spurious, specious and pernicious prejudice wherever you see it, all the more so if it is offered as legitimate argument. So today, we have for you:Or, in other words, a great day for those who deem goals to be overrated. What, to you, most says: “1990s”? Morning! Anyone here got any football? Luuuuuuvvvvvly ah ha ha ha ha. Well, this is a nice read. Mikel John Obi chuckles along as he remembers the time that Lionel Messi pipped him to the Golden Ball at the 2005 World Youth Championship. Before the game people said that I was going to win the Golden Ball for being the player of the tournament. But then Messi scored twice, both of them penalties, Argentina won 2-1 and I got the Silver Ball. Messi has kept on stealing awards from me!”And with that, I’m going to hand over to Daniel Harris. He’ll keep you in fine company. Bye. If you like maps as much as football then you’re probably a bit quirky, but we’re a broad church here at the  and this will be right up your street. It’s glorious, in fact. A Sky reporter just suggested that it’s surprising to see some of the England players doing shuttle-runs at an open training session, as though Gareth Southgate should have them all in flotation tanks. They’re fringe players. And it’s called warming up. It wouldn’t be a World Cup without a story about a dressing-room coup. This time around reports in Argentina – and let’s remember this is the country where this media abomination took place – suggest the players have wrestled control away from Jorge Sampaoli before the must-win game with Nigeria. But Javier Mascherano, who knows his way around a World Cup or two, has taken a jug of cold water and poured it all over those reports. Here’s another – more important – story about Iran fans, only this one is about the ongoing battle facing the nation’s female supporters who want to do that simplest of things and attend football matches. Shaun Walker in Moscow has spoken to one of the founders of the Open Stadiums movement, which campaigns for women to be allowed in to watch games.I didn’t really know how to cheer, because I’ve never been inside a stadium.” It’s eye-opening and ridiculous. It’s 2018. Iran fans were giving it loads in Saransk in the early hours in an attempt to keep Portugal players up. It seems to have worked too. Cristiano Ronaldo, in the form of mime, came to the window and told them to keep a lid on it as he was trying to get some shut-eye. Do you remember the last time a group of supporters tried to keep Ronaldo awake? Ah yes, he dumped their team out of the Champions League the following evening. “Good morning Gregg!” chirps David Penney. “Regarding the piece yesterday on Barry Davies, I’d like to mention another criminally underused commentator of Football Italia fame, Peter Brackley. He was so permanently chipper, he made my Sunday afternoons. I’ve heard he’s not doing so well health-wise so all the best Peter, you were great. ‘Angelo Di Livio! The little soldier!’” Ah, Peter Brackley, also well remembered for “The saviour has saved Lazio!”Here is the latest on the furore surrounding Mohamed Salah who, according to reports by the Associated Press, is absolutely fuming with Egypt and considering quitting after being used as a political symbol by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. The Egyptian FA claims he is a happy camper though:How pleasing on the eye were Colombia yesterday? It did make me wonder what José Pekerman might have done with Argentina had he not left after the 2006 World Cup. His patient style of possession play and knowledge of so many of the Argentina players from his days coaching them at youth level would surely have helped them be a more even force over the years. He helped create one of my favourite-ever goals at a World Cup too, and for Pékerman, it was the realisation of years of work. Thanks Richard. Off you go. Enjoy the rest of your day. So, how are we all? Great. What’s that you say? You want to digest some talking points from the second round of group matches? OK. Here you go then: That’s all from me, Richard Parkin, from the remote southern hemisphere desk. To take you ever closer to today’s four terrific fixtures I’ll leave you in the more than competent hands of Gregg Bakowski.Some very strong later challengers, but I can confirm the chocolate frog is in the mail to Andrew Benton. And by frog, we mean “a grooved metal plate for guiding the wheels of a railroad vehicle at an intersection” (see earlier). May it bear you great weights of chocolate.The Group B final matches become a little more intriguing though. Spain will be looking perhaps to make sure of top spot against Morocco, and will have the benefit of knowing who of Russia or Uruguay has emerged top from Group A. More importantly than their round of 16 opponents however is ensuring which end of the draw they progress into, give the potential ‘stacking’ of the bottom half with the likes of Brazil, Germany, England, Colombia etc.The Iran-Portugal fixture stands out as a cracker for mine, given the possibility of somebody other than Cristiano Ronaldo grabbing all the headlines: Carlos “I’m Portuguese and I used to coach Portugal but now I stand potentially as the man to knock Portugal out of the World Cup” Queiroz.Granted, if that were to happen Ronaldo would just drop some “Neymar tears” on half-way to try and draw the attention of all the world’s cameras. But it would still be a remarkable subplot.Do you reckon his whatsapp account has been buzzing this week? Friends and family sending him pictures of their nonna’s clutching a portuguese flag to remind him of his primary obligation?Queiroz was after all born not in Portugal but Mozambique but does this fact strengthen or weaken his resolve to do over his own country?Of course there is the remote possibility that if Morocco absolutely drubbed Spain AND Iran beat Portugal (but by a lesser margin) both the nation of his employers and the nation of his homeland might progress? Imagine that.So let us now return to day 12’s fixtures.We start with 34 “live” matches tonight with the only dead rubber, Egypt v Saudi Arabia still a pretty fascinating intercontinental grudge match between the ‘Giants of Africa’ and the ‘Titans of West Asia’ who just happen to share a border.Remarkably, it’s only the seventh time these two sides have met - with the last meeting over 11 years ago. So plenty there for pan-Arabic pride.The pick of the Group A matches is however Uruguay v Russia, with top spot of the line and the chance to avoid either Spain, Portugal or Iran - results which won’t be known until later - in the knockouts. It will also see the battle of the free-scoring host nation vs the free-from-the-bounds-of-convention Luis Suárez. In 2010 he rocked the World Cup with an outrageous deliberate handball against Ghana in 2014 it was his infamous taste-test of Giorgio Chiellini that commanded headlines across the globe. He’s an absolute loose cannon AND utterly brilliant - what could he possibly come up with tonight?!Speaking of permutations, for fans of the US election wonks FiveThirtyEight, it seems Nate Silver \u0026amp friends have branched out into football with their subtle blend of math (we’ll spare the plural given they’re American) and wizardry. And their current overall favourites might surprise you.Turns out that’s got even slimmer with news coming out of Korea that captain Ki Sung-yueng is reportedly scratched for their final group game against Germany.And before we turn our sights on the four Day 12 clashes, some final thoughts on that England performance last night, with two nice late night offerings you may have missed. Here’s Barney Ronay on how the joyful, smiling Jesse Lingard is an exemplar for a generally more relaxed England:And as we enter the final games of the group stages, Sachin Nakrani runs the rule over whether England should employ a ‘tactical’ result against Belgium:Ach. And some sad news just across my desk for those of you following this blog from Australia - with the passing of the trailblazing football journalist, Andrew Dettre, a colossus of the fledgling sport for over half a century. Rest in peace, Andrew. Now one of the weirder stories from around the globe this week (and haven’t we had a few to choose from) was the news that China has officially cracked down on videos of people whispering, eating ice and brushing hair.So if you’re one of those disgusting perverts who enjoy “autonomous sensory meridian response”, instead of just following the latest news here in written form, why not treat some of your other senses?I can neither confirm nor deny that intermittently throughout the recording of this one Barry Glendenning makes surprise appearances crunching on some ice in the background and occasionally attempting to brush Max Rushden’s hair. But like walking out of a cinema before the credits have finished, you don’t want to be left with a lingering feeling that you may have missed something spectacular if you don’t hear this one all the way through.I think my favourite part of that report was this:Egypt soccer federation spokesman Osama Ismail said that Salah has not complained to the federation. “Only what Salah writes on his Twitter account should be counted on.” Is this a red rag to a bull, an invitation to Salah to set the record straight? Or have the federation hacked his account and are resting smug in the knowledge that Salah’s continued silence will be considered as happy compliance?For the record, here’s Salah’s most recent tweet.. from four days ago:The Egyptian FA has even gone further on the PR front foot now claiming that Salah is “happy in the camp”.Presumably this means the footballing camp, and not some swiftly arranged re-educational facility.But returning to actual football content, with the bombshell that Mohamed Salah might have played his last ever game for Egypt.This from Associated Press:Mohamed Salah told Egypt team officials and teammates that he is considering retiring from international play because he is angry about being used as a political symbol while the World Cup squad was based in Chechnya, two people close to the player told The Associated Press Sunday.Salah the Muslim world’s most popular soccer player today said he was particularly annoyed with a team banquet hosted by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who used the dinner to grant Salah “honorary citizenship,” according to the two people. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.Egypt soccer federation spokesman Osama Ismail said that Salah has not complained to the federation. “Only what Salah writes on his Twitter account should be counted on.”Chechnya, a predominantly Muslim region in southern Russia, was devastated by wars between separatists and Russian forces. Kadyrov, a former rebel who switched his loyalties to Moscow, faces accusations of gross human rights violations, including abductions and killings.Salah, who also took part in a photo opportunity with Kadyrov, has been criticized by the British media for allowing the Chechen leader to use him to improve the government’s international image.Salah had not responded publicly to the criticism while the team was based in Grozny, the Chechen capital. Salah’s meetings with Kadyrov carry the potential to hurt his popularity in Europe, where he has been something of an ambassador for moderate Islam.News of Salah’s disapproval of Kadyrov’s actions leaked out just after the Egyptian squad left Grozny. The team is now in Volgograd for Monday’s game against Saudi Arabia which, like Egypt, has also been eliminated.Phwaor. Huge, if true. And you thought the ‘will-he, won’t he’ speculation ahead of Egypt’s opening game was big now to see if Africa’s reigning Footballer of the Year will play today.Now an idol of mine away from the hallowed turf of world football is definitely the eponymous hero of ‘Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace’ - who at one stage claims to be “one of the few authors who’s written more books than he’s actually read”.Similarly as somebody who’s hosted more podcasts than I’ve perhaps listened to, under duress from friends one of the few I’ve tried was ‘stuff you should know’ in particular an episode about Frogs, which I can happily report was utterly fascinating.And so, just when I thought I knew most things about frogs, Andrew Benton has dropped by my inbox with the following inquiry, referring to the offer made in the Preamble (see below):What sort of frog can we win? An amphibian, or (via Google search) ... “Frog - a thing used to hold or fasten something, in particular.”I’d have 5. the metal plate - it’d be huge, loads of chocolate. So, dear readers, which of the above options is YOUR favourite? And can we perhaps together come up with a push to get the terminology of being ‘a frog’, as in perhaps ‘the defensive midfielder who ties a side together’, into world football?I’d argue Kante definitely gets my vote thus far - and note, this is definitely part of a #reclaimfrog movement after arguably unwarranted attacks on Germany’s much-maligned Mesut Oezil earlier in the week:Last night’s third match, Poland v Colombia, while not perhaps a shock in terms of the result was perhaps one in terms of the execution this was a headshot, at least to the hopes of Polish supporters and their players and staff. Having breezed qualification much was expected of a team spearheaded by one of the world’s best No9s currently in action. Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski may have found fame (and goals) across the border, but in Robert Lewandowski, Poland boast a world-class striker capable of single-handedly wresting games from nervous opposition.Going into their opening match against Senegal, Poland faced the remarkable stat of becoming the 13th of 14 representatives from Europe not to lose their opening match in Russia, with only defending champions Germany falling at the first hurdle.As Jonathan Wilson so emphatically surmised after a second disastrous loss, though: “Poland, unfortunately, continue to be at their best when they are not in tournaments.”Here was his match report from Kazan, on a night that Colombia purred back into the reckoning as a potential late-tournament contender, and the tournament saw its first European nation eliminated:Last night’s second fixture was another fascinating battle - the type that makes the Fifa World Cup an unparalleled spectacle, as two utterly contrasting nations with markedly different footballing traditions and philosophies went head to head: Senegal v Japan.The West Africans have already won kudos for earning the continent’s first win of Russia 2018, with not just their fans impressing with their loveable tidiness, but also their team, by bucking lazy stereotypes about the defensive discipline or organisation of African nations.In a match that in punditry previews had been devolved into “African strength” vs “Asian technique”, both sides showed a high degree of both to hand down a result that makes Group H one of the more intriguing arm-wrestles going into the final round of group stage matches. Amy Lawrence took in the action in Ekaterinberg:And speaking of a salute from ‘down under’ - is there anything Australian football could offer that’s more perfect than this?G’day you flaming galahs - that’s not a football match, THIS is a football match.Indeed, there’s the most entirely “un-English” whiff of faint hope starting to form around Southgate’s unicorn-riding younglings, but criticism of Panama’s quality as an opponent has perhaps been overstated.Don’t forget, this is a nation competing at their first ever World Cup. Some reasonably passable footballing nations finished behind them in qualification (*cancels next trip to the United States*) and for all their inexperience, there’s no questioning the passion of the team that went out to represent the tiny central American nation.This terrific video of what hearing the Panamanian anthem meant to seasoned veteran commentators has done a fair rounds of the interwebs:And despite the 6-1 scoreline there were still some positives to take out of last night’s game for “the Sele”, as Fernando Cuenco writes:From a nation that went 270 minutes without scoring at its first ever World Cup, and then had to wait another 32 years to finally score a World Cup goal, we, the good people of Australia, salute you, Panama. But before we delve into Day 12’s tantalising encounters, like a patient Japanese sensai, let us first rake the stones of last night’s remarkable results.It all has to start with England’s stunning demolition of Panama, which if nothing else, has given rise to a surprise new candidate in the race for the Golden Boot:In the remarkable event that you’ve missed this result, here’s Daniel Taylor’s match report live from Novgorod, on a night where captain Harry Kane also didn’t harm his chances to emerge as the tournament’s leading scorer. Be-waistcoated manager Gareth Southgate was effusive in his praise for his lead man, as these comments post-match demonstrate:One of the significant reasons for Gianni Infantino’s push for an radical change to the group stages from the 2026 World Cup onwards is to prevent the raft of dead rubber games in the group stages apparently these have blighted tournaments of yore.So as we enter the final round of pool encounters set your alarms for “sleep in” because there will be nothing of interest ahead from here! Argentina, Argentschmina. They won’t be battling for their lives. And but for Philippe Coutinho or Toni Kroos both Brazil and Germany might have been staring at ignominous exits. Nor will there be any fascinating subplots like Portugal’s former coach Carlos Quieroz standing in the way of his own nation’s progress, as he looks to secure passage for Iran instead. Yes, after all those turgid 0-0 matches we’ve seen at Russia 2018, now comes the dead patch so walk your pets, catch up with old lost friends, and get round to those last three years of tax returns.Given the need to play final games simultaneously, you are now faced with the dilemma of choice from today onwards, and rewarded with four games overnight, not three.

The quality of the tomatoes in the UK is often pretty poor, so we roast the tomatoes in order to concentrate the flavour.Serves 4ripe plum tomatoes 8 olive oil 2 tbsp, plus extra for drizzling salt and freshly ground black peppersugar 2 tbsp ripe cherry tomatoes 8, halved thyme leaves from 6 sprigs garlic 1 clove, slicedbuffalo mozzarella 2 x 125g balls, slicedfresh basil 1 bunch, ideally with small leavesTo prepare the plum tomatoes, make a little incision with a sharp knife in the top of each one. Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and blanch the tomatoes in it for 10 seconds. Drain and plunge immediately into a bowl of iced water – this will make the skins easier to remove. Peel and cut in half lengthways. Remove all the seeds with a teaspoon.Preheat the oven to 120Cgas mark ½.Prepare a roasting tin just big enough to hold all of the tomatoes: drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil inside it, then sprinkle in salt, pepper and half of the sugar. Place all the tomatoes in the tin, cut side up, in one layer. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper and the remaining sugar.

Arrange in a generously sized shallow dish so the leaves are as separate as possible this will allow, all at once, for as much lateral distribution of the sliced eggs, a scattering of cress, the snipped chives and some dressing – the latter as a neat splatter – before mixing at table with the merest shine of oil and the faintest sprinkle of flaky salt and grind of pepper.Simon Hopkinson is a food writer and chefThe best way to enjoy these is with a glass of cava.

It’s worth it for the view alone – of a ridiculously pretty valley full of vineyards and orchards, June birdsong and butterflies. This is chocolate-box rural Switzerland.Matrusaden – it means “home of mother” – is a residential care home for people with mental illnesses. The\u0026nbspowner, a delicate-looking Indian woman in her late 60s, comes out to\u0026nbspgreet me and we sit down in the shade. She doesn’t look much like an\u0026nbspinternational criminal – wiretapper, fraudster, poisoner and\u0026nbspwould-be murderer.Sheela Birnstiel, previously known as Ma Anand Sheela, was, in the early 1980s, personal secretary to Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the guru and leader of the Rajneesh movement. Personal secretaryspokeswomanlieutenant … she ran it, basically. During a period when Bhagwan vowed silence, she was his\u0026nbspvoice. When Bhagwan and his followers were forced out of Pune, in\u0026nbspIndia, in 1981, they relocated to Wasco County, Oregon, and built a city, Rajneeshpuram, in the middle of nowhere where they could practise his mix of eastern mysticism, western philosophy and free love. To\u0026nbspthe Oregonian locals they were a\u0026nbspdangerous sex cult.It didn’t end well it wasn’t Jonestown bad, but it might well have been. There was an arms race, arson, espionage, drugs, Learjets and Rolls-Royces, immigration fraud, and a bioterror attack in which the salad bars of several restaurants were infected with salmonella and dozens of people were hospitalised. Sheela ended up\u0026nbspin jail.The story has been elbowed back into the world’s consciousness by the brilliant Netflix documentary series Wild Wild Country, which focuses on the conflict between the Rajneeshees and the Oregonian locals and officials, and in which Sheela is the standout star – star, anti-hero and villain.While we’re sitting outside, one of\u0026nbspSheela’s employees brings\u0026nbspout cold water, hot coffee and biscuits. Should I trust the biscuits, I\u0026nbspwonder. Sheela, who is 69 and a half, is a little frail at the moment, she says she hurt her back trying to stop a patient from falling and she is in a bit of pain. Another of her patients – Cristina, who has been at the home for 15 years – comes over to say hello. Next we are joined by Sheela’s dog, Kora, who is very old and frail, and has a large malignant tumour on her cheek. Sheela doesn’t think he is in pain. It seems like a peaceful, happy place. I am feeling more confident about the biscuits.Can this really be the same woman who threatened the American way of life, stuck up a middle finger and had the catchphrase “tough titties”? She will still give people – me included – the finger “if needs be”, she says, and she’ll be very clear if she doesn’t want to answer a question.In Wild Wild Country, Sheela comes across as obsessed (with Bhagwan for her, it was – and still is\u0026nbsp– all about him). But she is also manipulative and power hungry she does some bad things. But then she was a powerful woman way back in the 80s. Plus she said what she thought and she got things done – not least building a city for 10,000 people, complete with a shopping centre, pizza parlour, meditation hall and an airport. A reaction I have heard a lot and seen on social media goes something like: “Oh my God, it’s probably wrong to, but I bloody love Sheela. She’s proper badass.”She has heard the word, the badass one, in connection with herself. Does she like it? “It’s supposed to be\u0026nbspcomplimentary, I understand.” And which is she – a pioneering and inspirational example of girl power, or a megalomaniac monster and criminal? “Let people decide,” she says. Would she describe herself as\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspfeminist? “No, I don’t describe myself as anything. I describe myself as me. I have heard since the film has\u0026nbspcome out that people think I’m a\u0026nbspfeminist, but I don’t know what gives them that idea.”Well, the fact that she was in charge and it looked like there was some kind of equality there. Or at least that was the intention, I guess.But on that subject, what about all the sex? Bhagwan advocated an open attitude to sex, and everyone in Rajneeshpuram was at it everywhere all of the time (that’s certainly how the God-fearing locals saw it). Is that free-love approach more of a male utopia than a female one? “You\u0026nbspcould say that, because males are more sexually orientated than females. While females have been, until now, in a place of oppression, men have always been given more freedom. From that point of view, your analysis is accurate, that it is a male idea. And, of course, this open speaking about sex came from Bhagwan and he is also male, so one can say it is a male idea. But I personally don’t feel it should be male and female separated it’s human. We see it also in animals. They don’t make a big fuss about it when spring is there they enjoy their moment of sexuality.”Does she feel there was sexual equality at Rajneeshpuram? “For me it was equal.” And she was the boss? “Well, I took care of the practicalities, that was my job, that was what was assigned to me, and I was happy to do it.”Did she, does she, enjoy power? “There’s nothing to enjoy. When you have power, you don’t seek power and I think I have enough.” But you didn’t have it, you got it. You must have wanted it? “I was given power, I didn’t snatch power from anybody.”On the impact of the show, her sudden global fame (or infamy) hasn’t affected anything, she says. She’s still the same person as before and people who know her will say that. One thing she does like is that she has become “cause for thought for many people. My father always said I\u0026nbspmust always speak, whether people understand and do me justice or not. I must speak my experience it is very huge and they all can learn a lot through me, they can be inspired.”She did turn down appearing on the Indian version of Big Brother, as she felt she couldn’t spend the time away from the people for whom she is responsible. “I don’t need any more confinement, I have done my confinement,” she says.Sheela says she hasn’t watched all of Wild Wild Country and fast-forwarded through a lot of it, only slowing down for the bits that were new to her. Such as? “Bhagwan’s anger. I was already gone then. So, for me, that part was new.”She is talking about when, after the net was closing in on her, she escaped from Rajneeshpuram (not, she points out, sneaking off as has been suggested, but waved off by 300 people at the airport). And Bhagwan’s response? He said: “She did not prove to be a woman, she proved to be a perfect bitch.”It must have been upsetting to see that? “Sad,” she says. “When I was there, I was the star of his eyes. It made me sad that he had to stoop to that level. A man of his calibre does not have to go there it only shows his sorrow that I left.”She doesn’t seem to think any less of him because of it. “How can one’s opinion change because someone said something negative about me? I\u0026nbsplove the man, I still love him.”She doesn’t feel duped at all? “No,\u0026nbspbecause I was there because I\u0026nbspwanted to be there, and I would do it\u0026nbspagain. It was a very powerful creative project.”What about remorse? “Remorse for what? Having a good life?”OK, time to talk about the crimes, I think. You will know, if you have seen Wild Wild Country (and if you haven’t, you must), that after flying out of Rajneeshpuram, Sheela fled to\u0026nbspEurope, but was arrested in Germany in 1986 and extradited to the US on charges including wiretapping, immigration violations and attempted murder. The US attorney prosecuted crimes related to the restaurant poisonings. The Oregon attorney general prosecuted for crimes relating to the attempted poisoning of two Wasco County officials, as well as a poison syringe attack on Bhagwan’s own doctor, Swami Devaraj.Sheela took a plea-bargain and pleaded guilty to the lesser charges of immigration fraud and wiretapping (of Bhagwan’s house, which she says was done with his consent, for his own protection). She\u0026nbsppleaded guilty to the salad bar poisoning on a so-called Alford plea, meaning that she doesn’t admit to doing it but didn’t have the $2m it would cost to fight the charges. In state court, Sheela pleaded guilty to\u0026nbspthe attempted poisoning of two county officials as well as Bhagwan’s personal doctor. In the end, with time off for good behaviour (including painting her prison unit), she spent only 39 months in prison.So you didn’t poison anyone? “That’s right.” Who did? “Why do you ask me?” And the doctor, did she\u0026nbsppoison him? “Not my cup of tea.” What – him, or talking about it? “Both\u0026nbspare not my cup of tea.”Hmmm. OK, so what about the shocking episode in which thousands of homeless people were\u0026nbspbussed in to rig a local election? “We offered them an alternative lifestyle,” she says. You were using them, cynically, for your own political needs. “This is a custom of\u0026nbspevery major election: people clean\u0026nbspup the homeless and send them for voting. I was told this by a\u0026nbsppolitician.”It’s not common practice to sedate\u0026nbsphomeless people, though, is it, which hers were? “Don’t ask me because I am not aware of it.”While we are on politics, I want to know if she, as a former cultist, can see any cult-like behaviour in the current US administration? And this is when Sheela gets cross, steely and a bit scary. Not so much about the Trump comparison, but about my use of the C-word.“Your choice of words is totally wrong,” she says. “Let me explain to you how I see a cult. A cult is something you don’t understand, something you presume has nothing to do with reality. Nobody told me to go to Bhagwan, we each came from our own journeys. The gates were always open if someone wanted to leave, it was not confinement. I find this approach to negate something by calling it a cult so disrespectful. It’s like racists saying someone dark-skinned is automatically criminal. It’s so degrading.”It was a way of life, not a cult, she tells me. Oh, and she is no Trump fan\u0026nbspeither. I just about pluck up the courage to say that I saw her somewhere being compared to the presidential counsellor Kellyanne Conway. “No, I don’t allow that comparison, that much pride I have,” she says, but at least she laughs now. It’s a good time to start the tour, I\u0026nbspthink.She points out things in the view: the hill called Sonnenberg – Mountain of the Sun – and the vineyards (Sheela gave up drinking wine after working with alcoholics). How would she feel if 10,000 Oregonians suddenly arrived and set up home in this lovely valley, I wonder. “I\u0026nbsphope they wouldn’t ruin it, but I\u0026nbspdon’t think they would move here it wouldn’t suit them, it’s a bit more civilised,” she says, and she laughs. That’s something you see in the series, too, the perception from the Rajneeshees that they were superior to the Wasco County locals, cleverer and more civilised. The prejudice flowed in both directions.Sheela shows me a remembrance stone to her parents that features a photo. Her father, with a long beard, looks not unlike Bhagwan. “Oedipus complex,” she says, agreeing.There are more photos of her parents on the walls inside. And of her daughter – adopted, with the first of Sheela’s three husbands. She\u0026nbsplives in California with her own daughter, Sheela’s granddaughter. And there are lots of photos of Bhagwan, and of them together, including one of Sheela with her eyes closed while he touches her forehead with his finger, as if blessing her. In the bedroom Sheela shares with her older sister, Mira, and Kora the dog, there is another big photograph on the wall of Sheela, crouching at Bhagwan’s feet, serving him champagne. What were you celebrating? “Just being near him, nothing more than that.”Bhagwan might have said some horrid things about her, he might be long gone (he died in India in 1990), but I think it’s fair to say the obsession is alive and well.Actually, the champagne photo was taken on the plane on which they flew out of India when they left for the US in 1981. They booked the entire top deck. Bhagwan wasn’t the sort of guru to eschew material things: he had 93 Rolls-Royces.Sheela introduces me to Mira, who doesn’t much care for journalists. “Everyone wants to make their living at her cost and that\u0026nbspbothers me,” Mira says. “Always\u0026nbspnegative, many years now the past is\u0026nbspgone, nobody looks at the\u0026nbsppositive things.”Well, here’s something positive. Matrusaden seems like a brilliant place, open and integrated and warm. “We are not afraid of illnesses,” explains Sheela. “We are not afraid of anything and we want people to feel at home. We take people where they are people must not comply to our needs, we comply to their needs.”I meet more of the 29 patients, who are playing bingo with the therapist who comes in four times a week. They come from Switzerland, Turkey, Brazil and Vietnam. And I meet a lot of the staff, who are from Switzerland, Austria, Croatia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. There are\u0026nbsp15 nationalities in total, between staff and patients. Lots of them – both staff and patients – have been there for many years.Does it bother them that the boss is an international criminal? They laugh. No, they see her working from 7am to 7pm seven days a week, dedicated and committed to caring for the patients. You can’t be in this business for 30 years and not care about people. They could just be saying that because Sheela is in the\u0026nbsproom, of course.Would I like some watermelon before heading down the hill? I don’t know. Is it safe? I actually ask it this time. “You’ll have to take the risk,” says Sheela, and she laughs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/983dd26cc7cb21ac94cd905ceec037f1a210a77a/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01a36e9c0ba256d43f58f52ca7fd7493","title":"seven ways to strengthen your core","story":"Keeping these muscles in good condition will help you fend off a bad back – just make sure you mix it upA strong core isn’t about having photogenic abs, looking good in swimwear or grinding out another deadlift. It is a key element in dozens of everyday movements, including simple things such as carrying your shopping or getting out of bed in the morning. Many people know that a weak core can lead to a bad back, but the benefits of strengthening it are sometimes underappreciated. An analysis of studies published between 1970 and 2011, for instance, found that “core stability exercise was better than general exercise for reducing pain” in chronic low back pain patients. Given that back pain affects 540 million people globally, just five or 10 minutes a few times a week spent improving core strength is an excellent investment.Spine researcher Dr Stuart McGill at the University of Waterloo in Canada has spent his career studying back pain and its rehabilitation. He recommends a “big three” set of exercises. This consists of the curl-up, the bird dog (or quadruped) and the side bridge, all of which are low-intensity and suitable for almost everyone.Gyms usually offer short core-strength classes. Even if you much prefer exercising at home, it is always a good idea to make sure you are doing exercises correctly to avoid injury. Fitness apps such as Gixo and TrueBe use your smartphone camera to connect you to a trainer, so you can also have a one-off or “booster” PT session at home.Crunches and sit-ups were once the go-to core exercise for gymgoers and fitness routines. But these exercises are now thought to be quite hard on your back and to isolate muscles that would be better exercised in combination. Plank exercises – and other more dynamic movements – use more muscles at the front, side and back of your core. There are many different varieties, starting with the simple half plank – on your forearms and knees, rather than toes, maintaining a straight back. Longer is not always better: good form maintained for a small time is much better than bad form dragged out for minutes.Dead bugs are one of the simplest and most effective core exercises. Lie on your back with your arms extended, knees bent at 90 degrees, calves parallel to the floor. Keeping your lower back in contact with the floor, extend and lower your left leg and bring your right arm up. Tap your heel to the floor, return to the start and repeat with the opposite arm and leg, making sure your lower back never arches.Mixing it up is crucial, as is focusing on trying to keep your deepest abdominal muscles “engaged” – they are the ones you will feel when you cough. To add difficulty to a home routine, consider a TRX suspension trainer or a Swiss ball. These add a stability challenge to standard exercises. Others swear by pilates – although a Cochrane review suggested that, while it is effective, it is no more so than others form of exercise for pain and disability."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a256faab8539d949622c4d57e49114d162598d1/1468_315_1699_1019/master/1699.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1184709906421045d25cd5a2697ebfb","title":"jeremy hunt name curse strikes again at bbc","story":"Yet another broadcaster replaces crucial consonant in health secretary’s surname It is a verbal landmine that has gone off at Sky News, BBC Television and the BBC’s flagship morning radio show.And once again, Jeremy Hunt’s name has been taken in vain, with a presenter on the Today programme mispronouncing his surname by replacing a crucial consonant. Justin Webb made the error while reading out a story about the health and social care secretary during a review of newspaper coverage.“The paper says that health secretary Jeremy Cunt ...

But the overlooked clause in his property’s deeds has led to the Bury midfielder facing large legal bills and threatened with eviction.Ismail’s story is rare – but terrifying. He bought his home outright, and settled down to family life with his partner and young daughter. The first time the 24-year-old saw the word “rentcharge” was when he received a solicitor’s letter in December 2017 incorrectly describing him as “a tenant”. After a call, an amended letter arrived in January this year entitled “Outstanding rentcharges and fees” and included an invoice for backdated charges of £112.51, £3.61 interest, £240 for two letters, and solicitor’s fees of £480.The letter stated that if the total bill of £836.12 wasn’t settled within 21 days, the client “intends to either re-enter the property or grant a lease in respect of the property”. It went on to say that either would have “a detrimental impact on the value of your property and may result in our client applying for a possession order, and, ultimately, obtaining an eviction in respect of the property”.The “client” concerned was the managing agent responsible for maintaining the communal parts of Ismail’s estate: the charge related to cutting the grass verges. The letter added that if Ismail didn’t pay, he would also be liable for the managing agent’s costs of between £3,000 and £5,000. The letter referred to “a lease”, despite the footballer owning the freehold.Ismail assumed the letter was a mistake. It wasn’t.“Rentcharges” (or “chief rents”) are a relic from the past. Despite the similar terminology, they are nothing to do with renting, or leasehold ground rents. Most originated in the 19th and early 20th century, and were a popular way for owners to sell land to developers at a reduced fee. The subsequent freehold owners would pay an annual fee, typically £2 to £10, for ever.The Rentcharges Act 1977 meant that, with some exceptions, no new charges could be created after 22 August 1977, and existing ones were capped so they would expire in 2037. Unfortunately for the buyers of new-build freehold properties, “estate rentcharges” are one of the permitted exceptions.By using a “deed of transfer”, developers can oblige freeholders to pay a “rentcharge” or “estate charge” for the maintenance of communal areas of a private estate. With both, it’s not the money that is of the most concern, but the powerful legal rights the “rentowner” – the person who receives the payments – has to recover sums due. In some cases, these include taking possession of the property and using the income to clear the arrears. Or granting a lease of the property to trustees to raise any money due. These rights arise if the charge remains unpaid for more than 40 days, even if payment has not been demanded.Ismail’s partner’s mother, Tracey Atkinson, agreed to act as an advocate for him. She says: “The first communication he had about the charge was a threat of eviction from the solicitors. This had a huge detrimental effect. They were threatening eviction over a bill that was never received and the charges were all added on prior to the invoice dated 17 December 2017.“I told him to pay the outstanding charges and said I would deal with the legal fees. The solicitors refused to accept a part payment and the rest, as they say, is history.”In Ismail’s case, Bellway, which built his estate, maintains control over its management company. SDL Property Management collects the “rentcharge”. It then instructs another firm of solicitors to pursue unpaid charges.Ismail’s charges were £37.50 every six months but it emerged the bills were addressed to the previous owners and it remains unclear whose responsibility it was to update the managing agent’s records.SDL says: “When Mr Ismail bought this property in 2015 we were not made aware by him, his solicitors, the seller’s solicitors or the seller, that the property had been sold. For this reason, the request for payment of the estate charge was sent and addressed to the previous owner.“After receiving no response, a Land Registry search was obtained and we discovered the property had been sold. We then sent the invoice to Mr Ismail but received no response.“After sending two further reminders with no response, we followed standard procedure and instructed our solicitors to collect the debt on our behalf.“Eviction was only mentioned as an absolute last resort and this was made clear in the letter. There was no ‘threat to evict’ – it is our responsibility to tell debtors the consequences of them failing to pay.”Ismail has paid the charge and, after pressure from Atkinson, SDL has quashed the solicitor’s fees “as a gesture of goodwill” and rescinded the court action letter.The charge would usually be on a property’s “register of title” held at the Land Registry. This will tell you how much it is and details of the document that created it, but not always who it is payable to. “It will specify what happens if it is not paid. Typically, that the owner of the charge is entitled to interest on outstanding rent and, at worst, take possession of the property for non-payment. “However, in reality, that is unlikely, as a court order would be required,” says Anna Sparrow, solicitor at Slater and Gordon. “Unscrupulous owners could, in theory, not demand rent and then charge late-payment fees and solicitors’ costs. So it is imperative to ensure it is paid.”“Variable rentcharges” are more commonly found on newer developments to cover maintaining communal areas. Typically, this would have to be obtained from either the original transfer deed imposing it or the seller and company collecting the charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c304f3dbfaffa3519c267b7075faed1e1d9718a/0_88_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7aa0592a017db19403cf7949e3abb3","title":"teyana taylor ktse review kanye west","story":"Producer West melds old and new R\u0026ampB with flair on the Harlem singer’s second album – and ends with a wild left turnOn each consecutive Friday, since late May, the public has been issued with a Kanye West-produced seven-track album from an artist on his GOOD Music roster. That is, until this Friday, when the clockwork-like run – which has so far included records from Nas, Pusha T, West himself and Kids See Ghosts, his collaboration with Kid Cudi – was supposed to come to an end with R\u0026ampB singer Teyana Taylor’s second album. On Thursday, Kim Kardashian West tweeted that her husband was completing the record on the plane back from Paris fashion week. Friday came and went.Eventually, the album arrived on Saturday, by then lunchtime in the UK. The tardiness felt a tad disrespectful to Taylor – who spent Friday retweeting memes about the album’s delay – especially considering that her career hinged on West’s patronage far more so than any of the other artists involved in his creative reckoning. The 27-year-old has had a meandering and slightly befuddling trajectory since she signed her first record deal in 2007. In the years since, she’s appeared as one of the spoilt teenagers on the MTV docu-series My Super Sweet 16, choreographed videos for West and Beyoncé, and, in 2014, released her debut album, a collection of slinky but safe R\u0026ampB. Earlier this year, Taylor returned to reality TV with the premiere of VH1 series Teyana \u0026amp Iman, which followed her and her NBA star husband, Iman Shumpert. Once KTSE arrived, however, it was hard to stay cross with West for long. The album (the title stands for Keep That Same Energy) takes the artfully distorted old-school R\u0026ampB samples that double as his calling card – the ones that, over the years, he’s rendered increasingly abrasive and jarring – and returns them to a more blissed-out and soulful sound. That’s not to say there’s no gratifyingly contrarian editing: on opener No Manners, a gothic, gruff vocal is cut off mid-sentence before Gonna Love Me’s rapturous, pitched-up Delphonics sample kicks in, while the beginning of IssuesHold On sees West layer a tantalising portion of Billy Stewart’s I Do Love You under a boyish blast of laser sound effects. That said, that the reason this tactic has worked so well for West in the past is because he juxtaposed those saccharine, sped-up samples with his crabby, unhurried rapping. Occasionally, on KTSE, the vintage crooning is accompanied merely by more crooning courtesy of Taylor. Yet, most of the time, the pair manage to subtly offset the two components, doing so particularly well on Rose in Harlem, which matches an ancient-sounding slice of a Stylistics song with a fierce half-rapped singing style and muscular melisma. That song addresses the setbacks and career stalls that Taylor has experienced, as the Harlem native paints herself as that hardy rose. Lyrically speaking, it’s probably the most interesting track on KTSE, which is essentially a collection of love songs directed at her “handsome hubby” (as she describes him on No Manners). Yet while the romantic lyrics can seem emptily sentimental, they are infinitely preferable to the misjudged sauciness of Hurry and 3Way. The former is an initially pleasing reggae-laced ode to Taylor’s own bum that descends, agonisingly, into a series of orgasmic moans. The latter is a depressing tribute to threesomes with an unidentified “hoe” – who is quickly escorted out of her home once the deed is done – accompanied by unnecessarily graphic detail from Ty Dolla $ign.Generally, these missteps seem a relatively small price to pay for a record that melds new and old R\u0026ampB with such flair. And as if to address potential complaints that proceedings could have been more in-your-face, the album concludes with a wild left turn that brings with it new frontiers for both Taylor and West. The latter previously drew on house music on 2016’s Fade (whose video starred Taylor), but on WTP he amps up the tempo, recruits rapper and performance artist Mykki Blanco and incorporates samples from Paris Is Burning, the cult film about 1980s New York ballroom culture. Best of all, its brash, jacked-up backing track provides something for Taylor’s effortless voice to rub up against. It’s a welcome bit of friction – and, like the album it belongs to, a treat worth waiting for.

The group will then campaign for the party to go further and campaign for a public vote on the deal with an option to stay in the EU should voters reject the deal.Activists from 62 local Labour parties have pledged to raise the issue in a motion at the party’s conference this September, which the group said was a major shift among the Labour grassroots members, the majority of whom are Corbyn supporters.More than 100,000 people joined the people’s vote march through central London on Saturday, fronted by Labour’s Chuka Umunna, the Conservatives’ Anna Soubry, the Greens’ Caroline Lucas and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable.Corbyn did not attend the march and Labour’s position on Brexit was subject tocritical chants from the crowd, who sang: “Where’s Jeremy Corbyn?”Labour activists involved in the parallel drive for a people’s vote on the final deal believe in the need for leftwingers to have their own campaign, which does not disparage Corbyn. “It is essential that there is clear red water between the mainstream centrist remain campaigns and any serious attempt to get Labour to strengthen its Brexit position,” a source close to the campaign said. “Labour members are overwhelmingly on the left, and will never be won over by centrist MPs or a cross-party alliance that includes Tories. Ultimately they have different aims. This is about making sure that a Corbyn government can succeed.”The group’s launch statement has been signed by the general secretary of the TSSA union, Manuel Cortes, the economist Ann Pettifor, the former Momentum steering group member Michael Chessum and the former CWU general secretary Billy Hayes.The European Economic Area is made up of the EU’s single market, plus three European Free Trade Association members, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway they trade freely with the single market in exchange for accepting its rules. Switzerland is in EFTA but not the EEA bilateral accords give it special access to the single market. The four EFTA countries are not in the customs union: they can negotiate trade deals with third countries, like China.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.The statement says a Norway-style deal in which the UK becomes a member of the European Economic Area is “untenable” and instead argues for a full reversal, saying the effects of Brexit would make much worse the prospects that would face a socialist Labour government. “We are therefore coming together to urge the movement of which we are a part to oppose the Tories’ destructive Brexit and unite the country behind a radical and hopeful vision for the future,” it says. Paul Hilder, a Momentum member who ran to be Labour’s general secretary this year, said: “The overwhelming majority of Labour members are both supporters of Jeremy Corbyn and opponents of Tory Brexit, but until now, we have been shut out of the debate. This is too important to be left to a handful of anti-Corbyn centrists whose motives are in question and who cannot even win a vote in Westminster.”Pettifor, an advisor to the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: “Only an alliance of a left-led Labour party with socialists and progressive partners across the continent can challenge the dominant Anglo-American economic model of globalisation that is causing such harm in Britain and across the world.”Cortes said the Conservatives were offering “a kamikaze Brexit”, adding that there was “nothing in Brexit for working people”.The CLPs that have submitted the motion for debate at conference include Corbyn’s Islington North CLP. Local member Valerie Bossman-Quarshie, who submitted the motion, said she had rejoined the party because of Corbyn, but urged him to back a second referendum. “As long as the Tories are in government this is the only way to stop their Brexit deal doing more harm to ordinary people’s lives,” she said. Momentum has thus far given its full backing to Corbyn’s Brexit policy but may be forced to hold its own vote on its position after a petition organised by an activist, Alena Ivanova. The petition has so far half the 4,000 signatures needed to trigger a poll of members on “whether to oppose Tory Brexit, and whether to campaign for Labour to hold a vote at its annual conference in September on giving the people the final say on the Brexit deal”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78ad886fcd48170273f9924c1acdcadeaf1aba8a/0_202_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=703dd62424072a3cf4afcfa96a467e9d","title":"star attraction royal observatory seeks volunteers to use new telescope","story":"Cutting-edge telescope makes Greenwich a working observatory for the first time in 60 yearsPull on the right ropes and the dome at the Altazimuth pavilion at the Royal Observatory Greenwich swings around and opens up to reveal a thick band of London sky. The Victorian building is about to emerge from a major refurbishment and inside the dome sits the main attraction: a cutting-edge telescope that will make Greenwich a working observatory for the first time in 60 years.The installation of the Annie Maunder Astrographic Telescope (Amat) has staff at Greenwich palpably excited. Over the obligatory banging of builders at work, Brendan Owens and Tom Kerss, both astronomers at the site, admit that they have been working late, very late, to put the kit through its paces. If they are tired from being up all hours, they do not let it show. “It’s a little bit addictive,” Owens says.Named after one of the first women to work at Greenwich, the £50,000 telescope is arguably the most impressive that can be bought off the shelf. It has the power to capture high magnification still and moving images of the sun, moon and the planets of the solar system. Farther afield, it will study the chemical makeup of nebulae, those interstellar clouds of dust and gas, and watch alien worlds such as the massive Jupiter-like 51 Pegasi b loop around their parent stars.The images and readings taken by the telescope will support astrophysics research and be shared with schools and the public through live-streams, the Peter Harrison Planetarium next door, and workshops held at the observatory. To help out with the running of the telescope the observatory is looking to teams of volunteers, many of whom are likely to come from local enthusiasts’ clubs. “We want to make use of every clear night we get,” said Kerss.For the moment the five-metre wide dome is manually operated: rotated and opened by ropes and pulleys. But there are plans to retrofit the structure with motors and electronics so the telescope and dome can move in unison. This would allow the telescope to follow objects over hours as they move across the night sky, and even track the International Space Station as it hurtles overhead at 17,500mph.“The automation work will be essential if we want to do more research projects,” said Owens. “It’s either that or we get someone who is extremely dedicated with the ropes.”Charles II founded the Royal Observatory in Greenwich in 1675 with the aim of mapping the precise locations of stars and so improve the Navy’s maritime navigation. But since 1957, when its instruments and research were moved to Herstmonceux in East Sussex, the London site has been a museum and centre for public outreach. With the new telescope in place, research is back on the agenda. When the Altazimuth pavilion opens to the public in August, the exhibition space on the ground floor beneath the telescope will tell the stories of Annie Maunder and her husband Walter. Annie joined the observatory in 1891 after passing her exams at Cambridge University with flying colours. Back then, Cambridge did not award women degrees, but Annie’s clear mathematical skills earned her one of the few paid jobs in astronomy that were available to women.Annie worked on solar observations, a department run by Walter Maunder, and when the two married in 1895, she had to resign her post due to restrictions that barred married women from working in public service. The pair continued to collaborate though, writing books together, setting off on expeditions to observe solar eclipses, and mapping sunspots in work that established the connection between the sun’s activity and Earth’s climate. Noting that the Royal Astronomical Society did not allow women members at the time, Walter Maunder co-founded the British Astronomical Association, which explicitly did welcome women, and people from all backgrounds. Annie went on to edit the association’s journal for 35 years.Brushing aside a piece of bread that appeared to have fallen through the open dome from a passing bird, the astronomers at Greenwich explain how Amat is actually a cluster of four separate instruments. The largest, a 14-inch reflector, can take high resolution images of the sun, moon and planets, picking out features such as Jupiter’s swirling red storm, or dark patches on Neptune near the edge of the solar system. A second instrument is dedicated to observing the sun, while a third that resembles a Tommy gun has a circular magazine of filters which can be swapped automatically to view distant nebulae at different wavelengths of light. The fourth is a general purpose telescope. The cluster of telescopes and the refurbishment of the pavilion were paid for by grants, museum members and patrons, and public donations that together raised more than £150,000 for the project. The first images released from the telescope reveal the rugged terrain on the waxing gibbous moon and fierce activity in the sun’s atmosphere.  “We’ve just started our adventure,” says Owens. “We want to make Greenwich a functioning observatory and to involve the public with that work. We want to have the best of both worlds.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27db7f418d376fe70538fbbf896c4eb89d093632/86_410_5057_3034/master/5057.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9b9168657c1f57baeb4d54c93eced27","title":"lewis hamilton wins french grand prix sebastian vettel","story":"• Mercedes driver wins in France to re-take Championship lead• Hamilton unhappy with title rival over Valtteri Bottas crashIn a title fight that increasingly looks as if it is going to the wire, performance under pressure at key moments is going to be vital. At the French Grand Prix Sebastian Vettel was once again found wanting and Lewis Hamilton, in the manner England had shown in Russia before the race, was able to step up and clinically take advantage with a dominant display. He took the win and the lead of the world championship once again. If he is to secure his fifth title this season, these are the moments that will make the difference.After a poor weekend at the last round in Canada, where he saw his 14-point lead in the championship turned into a one-point deficit, Hamilton had still warned that he expected Ferrari would falter at some point. He might not have been expecting it to happen so soon, however, and Vettel’s error means he again holds a 14-point lead over the German.There was a celebratory air at Circuit Paul Ricard as the race welcomed France back to the Formula One calendar after a 10-year hiatus and the grandstands were flooded with tricolours and the stirring sound of La Marseillaise. But for Vettel, any optimism would have turned to regret barely moments after the final bars of the mighty anthem had died away.Starting from third behind Valtteri Bottas he had been quick off the line on the faster ultrasoft tyres but was too hot into turn one, locked up and found himself with nowhere to go, clipping the rear of the Finn. Vettel had to pit for a new front wing and Bottas for a puncture. They emerged at the back of the field while Hamilton, clear of the carnage, took to the clean air and controlled the race from start to finish. He took the flag in front of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen.Vettel was given a five-second penalty for causing a collision but drove an impressive comeback, scything though the field to take fifth, as much as he might have expected. But Bottas could manage only seventh after taking damage to the floor of his car from the puncture.Hamilton was pleased with his performance but critical that Vettel had not received a harsher penalty. “It’s disappointing for the team,” he said. “We all go into turn one as hard as we could but when someone destroys your race through an error and it’s only a tap on the wrist and you are still able to come back and finish ahead of the person you took out, it doesn’t add up.”He was joined in the criticism by the Mercedes non-executive chairman, Niki Lauda. “Why Vettel gets only five seconds for this enormous mistake, I don’t understand,” said the driver who won here for Ferrari in 1975. “It is too little. Five seconds is nothing, he destroyed the whole race for himself and for Bottas.”Vettel considered the punishment appropriate but he was left to consider another moment that proved costly. Last season his barge on Hamilton in Baku was ill-judged and his poor decision at the start in Singapore was the beginning of the end of his title fight. He was too hot on the restart in Baku this season and he lost places. He has the charging instincts of a racer but in this fight with Hamilton he simply cannot afford repeatedly to drop points.The German admitted he had been at fault. “My start was too good and I ended up with nowhere to go,” he said. “It was my mistake, I tried to brake and get out of it but I couldn’t. I had nowhere to go, with little grip I unfortunately made contact with Valtteri.”Mercedes had fitted their new engine here and will be buoyed by the clear evidence that it has matched and potentially bettered the step forward that Ferrari made with their new unit, although Vettel remained optimistic his team could have equalled them. “I think we had good pace,” he said. “It is difficult to say if we could have challenged but I think we had the pace to at least go with Mercedes.”His error means waiting until Austria and Silverstone to find out but here Hamilton had climbed into the cockpit, heartened from England’s demolition of Panama, and proceeded to deliver his own masterclass in applying relentless pressure to an opponent under the cosh. Doubtless he hopes he can continue riding the same wave as Gareth Southgate’s men.“6-1, that’s a mighty score,” he said. “What a great result for England today, if they are playing like that they need to keep opening a can of whoop-ass on everyone. That could be awesome, I don’t know how England would take it if we did win the World Cup. It’s been such a long time.”Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo was in fourth, Kevin Magnussen in the Haas was sixth the Renaults of Carlos Sainz and Nico Hülkenberg in eighth and ninth and Sauber’s Charles Leclerc once again drove superbly to take 10th.

I’ll let you know the Lancashire team sheet as soon as I get it - two spinners probably on the pitch that was so hard to bat on yesterday.And, with barely a breath taken, welcome to the this, the last round of Championship cricket for a while.  But let’s not think about that just yet. It’s going to be a peculiar round with five daynight games, a midday start here at Old Trafford on what looks like yesterday’s pitch while the stewards clean up after the ODI, and only two games staring at the prescribed hour: Glamorgan v Northants at Sophia Gardens and the game to be at – Yorkshire v Surrey at wonderful Scarborough. Those of you who are there – you lucky, lucky few. It would be hard to top the excitement of the last round, but fingers crossed in what is going to be a scorching week of weather.At aforementioned Scarborough, head of the table Surrey take on a Yorkshire side topping the stragglers in fifth. Surrey were magnificent at Guildford – young guns-a-roaring. Yorkshire come straight from the bore-fest at the Ageas – and with one fewer rest day. They are still missing seven players with either England or the Lions Surrey will be without Sam Curran, Jason Roy and Ben Foakes. Here at the Old Trafford dog-fight, Lancashire need a win to lift them from the doldrums with another couple of disastrous hours at New Road losing them the match against Worcestershire. There look like big changes a-foot with a very different-looking squad – Chanderpaul has been left out and Joe Mennie is missing - another concussion victim. Liam Livingstone and Parkinson are still away with the Lions. Hampshire, who play the Royal London Final on Saturday, are missing Liam Dawson. At Chelmsford, Essex and Somerset both come straight from a loss. Somerset are without Matt Renshaw, heading home after breaking a finger at Guildford, and Jack Leach, laid up for seven days after being hit on the head by Morne Morkel in the same game. Ryan ten Doeschate returns to the Essex captaincy after suspension.Stuart Broad returns at Trent Bridge for a bowl with the pink kookaburra in Nottinghamshire’s day-night game against Worcestershire.In Division Two, Derbyshire take on Leicestershire with the pink Dukes ball, and at The Riverside Durham play Warwickshire in another day-nighter. Warwickshire come from a brave run-chase, Ian Bell still in breathless form.Glamorgan meet Northamptonshire for the wooden-spoon match at Wantage Road and Kent, fresh from a wonderful win against Warwickshire, play Middlesex, also cock-a-hoop- after victory over Leicestershire. Sam Billings will resume the captaincy from Joe Denly, but Matt Henry and Darren Stevens are rested ahead of Lord’s. Middlesex remain without Nick Gubbins and Tom Helm on Lions duty – although Dawid Malan continues as captain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f902ba3cbc6b779045543d3bef318621200dc897/416_785_6463_3877/master/6463.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a0689233912291a254cb5b58f5e62eb","title":"rachel parris comedian musical standup political satire mash show","story":"The whip-smart comic talks about mocking Piers Morgan and Donald Trump, mixing scorn with good cheer and moving from songs to satire‘Determined cheerfulness is something I happen to do very well,” says Rachel Parris. If you’ve seen her live musical comedy shows, you won’t need telling: they present Parris as a wholesome West End Wendy forever on the verge of a nervous breakdown, performing songs that put a brave face on a chaotic life (The Gym Song) or – like her terrific X Factor spoof I’m Amazing – clothe sharp satire in faux-positivity.No one who saw her excellent but unheralded stage shows ever doubted Parris’s talent, but it’s a big surprise that she’s now found her mainstream niche in political satire. Her whip-smart work on the BBC show The Mash Report has been adored – and deplored – by tens of millions, and she’s become one of the most prominent political comics in the UK and beyond.On the one hand, it’s a classic rags-to-riches story, from an act whose spring tour – tickets hitherto hard to shift – ended up playing to packed houses. On the other, Parris makes no bones about how unsettling the past few months have been. Judging by the number of times she says she doesn’t know if she’s allowed to answer my questions, she’s still adjusting to life under a new kind of scrutiny.The 34-year-old feels misrepresented by the widely told story of her breakout success. In February, her weekly Mash Report slot mocked Piers Morgan’s ITV interviewlove-in with the US president, replete with a graphic of the former’s tongue up the latter’s backside. It made a very big splash: “There was a lot of excitement and fury,” says Parris, euphemistically (I think she means hostility and hysteria), “directed at my door. And now everyone’s like, oh it was that item that blew everything up with The Mash Report. But it wasn’t. It was the sexual harassment one.” This was a heavily sardonic tutorial in How Not to Sexually Harass Someone that Parris co-wrote and performed (with host Nish Kumar as her stooge) two weeks before.That episode, she recalls, aired without fuss. But her life changed when the BBC tweeted her clip from it the following Monday morning. “Within three hours it had millions of views,” says Parris. “My phone was going ding ding ding ding. It all happened so quickly.” In both the harassment and the TrumpMorgan segments – and in later ones exploring the phenomenon of the public apology, say, or Jacob Rees-Mogg – Parris mixed scorn and butter-wouldn’t-melt good cheer into a highly potent satirical cocktail. Even in the first series, she says, “the joke was to have me reading out egregiously offensive or stupid social media output, and staying very upbeat while I did so”.Her success as a satirist has surprised her, too – although she insists on the small-p political content of her prior work, and its consistency with her Mash Report material. “Yes it’s about Jacob Rees-Mogg, but it’s also about how that affects feminism, women’s rights. For me, there’s always got to be a personal or social angle.”She’s delighted, meanwhile, to have shaken off the musical comedy label, which sees her patronised by fellow comics and has, Parris argues, kept her off panel shows. “Over the years, producers have said, ‘what would Rachel do on it? There isn’t a slot to do one of her songs.’ And it’s like: ‘No, I talk as well!’” No such problem any more: it’s amazing what a reported 26m online views can do. “Now, instead of having to fight to get in the audition room, people are – for the moment – coming and asking me if I want to be on.”That’s “a dream come true”, she says: her appearance on QI in particular. But she’s not abandoning live performance – with her colleagues in the Regency-era improv format Austentatious, resident monthly in the West End. Nor in her solo shows: she’s now cooking up a “greatest hits plus bits of The Mash Report” package to take on the road in autumn. It’s designed to break new fans in gently to what she’s been doing on stage for years. Otherwise, she says – drawing on recent experience – “the initial reaction is ‘why is Rachel Parris who does political satire trying to sing and play? Has she lost her mind?’”And then? Well, Parris is hoping for some calm after the storm (“I think things are going back to normal now …”), but by no means a return to obscurity. Her first half of 2018 “has changed the whole concept of a career path”, she says, “because what would have seemed like a pipe dream now seems possible”. Alongside the autumn tour, there’s series three of The Mash Report, due later this year. Beyond that, she nurses an ambition to emulate Tim Minchin’s transformation from comedian to musical-theatre maestro – and dreams of writing her own sitcom or Victoria Wood-style solo TV show. “Which all my instincts tell me is not going to happen,” says Parris, modest to a fault. “But after the year I’ve had, it now seems like – well, who knows?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff0d7f3285f0208251bdeb535131a170a7fe5bef/400_580_3903_2342/master/3903.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1439e91fb03a402126f2ea90aac0184f","title":"apple appease customer free macbook keyboard repairs","story":"Company’s admission over faulty keyboards follows litany of complaints Apple has admitted that its MacBook and MacBook Pro laptop keyboards made since 2015 are susceptible to becoming stuck or breaking, and is promising to repair them for free.Following a litany of user complaints across support forums, specialist media, class action lawsuits and 31,000-strong online petitions, Apple said it had determined that a “small percentage of the keyboards” were affected by the issues.The keys can feel sticky and letters or characters can fail to appear when the key is pressed, or keys can repeat unexpectedly.Keys were found to be prone to becoming stuck when small amounts of dust and debris collected under them, leading to inoperable keyboards and irate users. A second iteration of the keyboard was launched in 2016, which also appears to be affected.“Apple or an Apple authorised service provider will service eligible MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards, free of charge,” the company said in a new support document. “The type of service will be determined after the keyboard is examined and may involve the replacement of one or more keys or the whole keyboard.”The 12in MacBook made from early 2015 and the 13in and 15in MacBook Pros made from 2016 are covered by the repair programme up to four years from when they were purchased. Apple also said that consumers who had already paid for a repair could request a refund of the charges, which could have cost hundreds of pounds.This is the second time in 12 months that Apple has relented on support issues to attempt to appease customers and maintain brand loyalty. In December, it admitted to slowing down iPhones with ageing batteries and reduced the cost of its battery replacement programme.Market watchers welcomed the news in appeasing customers of Apple’s computer line. But Patrick Moorhead, the head of Moor Insights \u0026amp Strategy, said the issues simply illustrate just how loyal users were to Apple’s brand and platform. He said on Twitter: “Apple Keyboardgate demonstrating. Just how loyal and forgiving Mac users are.

These include complete control of the cabinet and the power to appoint senior judges and officials, including unelected vice-presidents. The president will also have the power to issue decrees with the force of law.Those powers will allow the victor to transform Turkey’s political scene for years and possibly decades to come, governing until 2028 if he wins re-election. Opposition candidates had pledged to overturn the presidential system if they had won.The results, if they stand, will be a disappointment to the opposition, which had hoped to push Erdoğan into a second-round runoff against İnce, and to wrest control of the legislature from the AKP. Erdoğan and his party have governed unopposed for 16 years.The president called early the snap elections in April hoping to preempt worsening economic trends and to catch the opposition by surprise. He looked set to win easily in a presidential race and in parliament in alliance with the nationalists, projecting an image of a commander-in-chief fighting external enemies inside Turkey and across the border in Syria, and triumphant against terror groups. But the opposition mounted a dynamic election campaign, with its presidential candidate İnce drawing crowds in the hundreds of thousands in rallies in the country’s largest cities of Istanbul, İzmir and Ankara, and criss-crossing the country on dozens of rallies.Opposition officials cried foul as soon as results began coming in, with the state-run Anadolu Agency announcing preliminary results more than two hours earlier than expected and opening with a massive lead for Erdoğan and his party’s alliance in parliament.That lead closed over time, but it prompted accusations by the opposition that the state news agency was launching a manipulation operation to influence election monitors into leaving ballot counting stations early.The first result would lead to a second-round contest on 8 July, a possibility that would represent a major psychological blow for Erdoğan, even if he was tipped to win that contest as well.İnce urged ballot count monitors to remain at their stations until the counts had been completed to protect against election fraud.Nevertheless, Erdoğan had already been congratulated on a win in the race by Hungary’s strongman leader, Viktor Orbán.The election took place on an uneven playing field, against a backdrop of human rights abuses that Amnesty International described as a “climate of fear”.One of the presidential candidates, Selahattin Demirtaş, ran his presidential campaign from a prison cell in Edirne where he is on trial on terrorism charges. The government has either shuttered, bought or taken over newspapers and TV stations, transforming the vast majority of the nation’s media into a loyalist press.Thousands of people have been detained or dismissed since a coup attempt in 2016, a crackdown that has gone beyond the followers of Fethullah Gülen, the man accused of masterminding the coup from his exile in Pennsylvania, to dissidents of all stripes including academics, students who opposed military incursions into Syria, judges, bureaucrats and police and military officers.Nevertheless, there were few incidents of apparent electoral fraud, with the exception of the province of Urfa, where some apparent attempts to rig the vote were uncovered during the course of the day. Poll stations opened at 8am and closed at 5pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba6be28f104dc5543569ba553b1da72e28ba1391/0_284_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bb3ef912a761ee902bf5d17a393a5fb","title":"china blocks hbo after john oliver parody of xi jinping","story":"Mocking of Chinese president and criticism of human rights record earns ban for comedian’s network HBO’s website has been blocked in China after censors on Chinese social media platform Weibo banned mentions of John Oliver following the British comedian’s parody of Chinese president Xi Jinping.According to the anti-censorship and monitoring group Greatfire.org, HBO’s website was completely blocked within China as of Saturday, days after media reports emerged that Weibo had censored new posts mentioning Oliver or his HBO show Last Week Tonight.After a wide-ranging 20-minute segment 17 June in which Oliver called Xi the “creepy uncle who imprisons 800,000 people in his basement”, the Twitter-like service blocked new posts related to Oliver as well as searches for the show’s Chinese name, Shangzhou jinye xiu. Attempts to access HBO’s website from within China were unsuccessful on Monday. The website for HBO Asia, a Singapore-based broadcast network that airs HBO content in China through Dingjijuchang, a Tencent TV subscription service, also appeared to be blocked. The subscription does not include all HBO shows.HBO did not respond to requests for comment on the censorship of Oliver on Weibo. Tencent was not immediately available.His segment on Xi could not be found on Chinese streaming sites where other episodes of Last Week Tonight have been uploaded by inidual users. Youtube, which hosts clips of the show, has long been blocked in China. Any blocking of HBO’s website in China is not likely to have a huge impact. Access to HBO’s often salacious content has always been spotty in China, with Chinese broadcasters heavily censoring shows like Game of Thrones. Most Chinese users watch HBO through virtual private networks, or VPNs.In the show, Oliver made fun of the Chinese president’s apparent sensitivity over comparisons of his figure with that of Winnie the Pooh. Images of the AA Milne character, used to mock Xi, have been censored in China. “If your face even remotely resembles that of a beloved cartoon character, the smart move here is to lean in,” Oliver said, showing an image of his own face next to that of The Lion King’s Zazu, a red-billed hornbill.Oliver also took a serious tone in the show, criticising Xi for the removal of term limits from the Chinese constitution, the use of political re-education camps in the Muslim province of Xinjiang, and a crackdown on civil society. Oliver noted the continued house arrest of Liu Xia, wife of Chinese dissident and nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo who died last year while serving an 11-year prison sentence.

The UK has been very good because it wants to maintain cooperation with Europe beyond bilateral ties.”The UK has traditionally been wary of efforts to build a European defence cooperation that could challenge Nato structures, but has become a champion of such initiatives since the vote to leave the EU.A French government source said the UK’s involvement was key, as the two military powers shared similar cultures and analytical approaches on how to tackle a crisis. “That culture is not shared between every EU member state,” the source said.The initiative is expected to aid joint planning on events such as natural disasters, crisis intervention or the evacuation of citizens from hot spots.Since 2007, the EU has had four multinational military “battle groups” but the troops have never been deployed.

The companies say they monitor child labour and remove children from the fields to go to school, but experts have told the  that the numbers are going up, not down, as tobacco growing increases in Africa and Asia.Farming tobacco to produce the leaf that fills cigarettes can involve: Tobacco firms say they ban under 18s from hazardous work.The consequences for children are lifelong. “I wanted to be a nurse,” said one 14-year-old girl in Malawi, who spends her days weeding under a hot sun with a heavy hoe.Families see no option but to use their children in the fields as unpaid labour. Many are in debt to landowners and landlords and have to stay on from one season to the next, unable to break the cycle of deprivation.“No effective actions have been taken to reverse this scenario,” said Vera Da Costa e Silva, head of the secretariat of the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, a key body tackling an industry that kills more than 7 million people a year. “What happens is that tobacco farming gives its profits to the industry but gives very low incomes to the tobacco growers themselves.” The tobacco firms say they are doing everything they can to end exploitative child labour.But it is a scandal for which the multinational companies have a direct responsibility, she said. “There is a double burden – the burden of child labour itself and the burden of working on a deadly product that ultimately affects the children themselves.”Silva said about 1.3 million children a year were working in tobacco fields in 2011 and, according to the UN’s International Labour Organization (ILO), the numbers are rising with a shift in tobacco growing from some of the better-off countries to some of the poorer. It declined between 2000 and 2013 in Turkey, Brazil and the United States, said the report to the organisation’s governing body in February 2017, but increased in others, such as Argentina, India and Zimbabwe.Given that child labour in agriculture occurs more often in low-income countries, the ILO report said, “this shift in production may have resulted in increased child labour and other decent work deficits in tobacco production. Although there are no estimates of the number of child labourers in tobacco globally, surveys indicate that in impoverished tobacco growing communities, child labour is rampant.”The US Department of Labor lists 16 countries where children are suspected to work in tobacco. Human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch have documented child labor in the tobacco fields in Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Brazil and most recently Zimbabwe. Experts say the very low prices paid to farmers in countries like Malawi make child labour inevitable.BAT and JTI tobacco firms say light work in the fields that does not affect health or education is acceptable for 13-15 year olds. Campaigners say they should not be anywhere near tobacco before they are 18.The average income of a tenant farmer in Kasunga, one of the biggest tobacco-growing areas of Malawi, for 10 months of work was 223,710 kwacha (roughly $380 or £286 at current rates) according to a study in 2017 by the Centre for Social Concern, a Malawian NGO.There is evidence of child labor in the tobacco industry at least 16 countries, according to the US labor department’s bureau of international labor affairs (ILAB): Additionally, human rights groups have identified child labor in Zimbabwe and the USA.Around the world, there are estimates of 1.3 million children being involved in some form of tobacco industry labour. Last year, the UN’s International Labour Organi​zation (ILO) said the numbers were rising with a shift in tobacco growing from some of the wealthier countries to some of the poorer. The figures declined between 2000 and 2013 in Turkey, Brazil and the United States, said the report to the organisation’s governing body in February 2017, but they increased in others, such as Argentina, India and Zimbabwe.Each kilo of tobacco is estimated to provide enough for 1,200 cigarettes tenant farmers in Kasungu last year earned 200 kawacha (30 cents or 23p) per kilo when the crop was sold.Tenant farmers are at the bottom of the tobacco food chain. They agree to work for a year for a contract farmer who has land, which he may own or have leased. That farmer’s contract is with one of the big leaf-buying companies – Alliance One, Universal (in Malawi known as Limbe Leaf) or Japan Tobacco International (JTI). The leaf-buying companies agree to purchase tobacco from their contract farmers and supply seed, fertiliser, pesticide and tools. The leaf buyers say they tell them not to employ children. Alliance One said the elimination of child labour is a “top priority” Universal said it is committed to fighting child labour. The leaf-buyers are fulfilling orders from cigarette manufacturers – British American Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco.The tobacco giants have their own corporate social responsibility schemes. They say they monitor child labour and build wells or schools. But Professor Marty Otanez, of the University of Colorado in Denver, an anthropologist who has studied tobacco farming in Malawi for many years, said the welfare projects were “pushing out goodwill on behalf of tobacco companies to address some of the problems but avoid the harder issues of leaf prices and living and earnings”.All of the four major companies say they are doing what they can. “BAT takes the issue of child labour extremely seriously and agrees that children must never be exploited, exposed to danger or denied an education,” said a spokesperson. “We do not employ children in any of our operations worldwide and make it clear to all of our contracted farmers and suppliers that exploitative child labour will not be tolerated.” Imperial Tobacco said: “Child labour is unacceptable and we make every effort to stop it happening in our supply chain.”PMI called child labour an unacceptable reality. “We are committed to eliminating child labor and other labor abuses wherever we source tobacco,” said Miguel Coleta, the company’s sustainability officer. “We have been working to tackle the root causes of child labor head-on and have achieved a global reduction of child labor incidents on contracted farms over time. We welcome continued systematic scrutiny of our efforts and recognize we cannot succeed alone. This requires serious and lasting efforts by all stakeholders, including government and civil society.”JTI also said child labour was endemic to agriculture but had been decreasing in areas where it directly contracted farmers. “The reality is that child labor stems from a combination of social, economic and regulatory causes. At JTI, we don’t pretend to be able to solve the problem of child labor on our own, but we are doing our utmost to play our part in solving the problem, working with others,” the company said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6de16f914dca07103291a64692b86637ae79a39/0_0_4929_3169/master/4929.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3b88d916ea266c02f146c146ac128ce3 1400w","title":"zsa zsa english bulldog wins worlds ugliest dog competition in pictures","story":"English Bulldog wins competition in Petaluma, near San Francisco, California.

In another world, she would be with friends in the school playground. Instead, she is bent double at the hips, gouging out weeds from the earth under a savage sun between banked rows of tobacco plants using a heavy hoe, made of a tree branch and a metal plate.About this contentShe looks up in some wonderment, unused to questioning such a life for a child. She is not unusual. There are 18 tenant families on this tobacco farm in the Kasungu district of Malawi, each living in a straw hut. Only two of the other girls go to school, she says. Two-year-old Jackson Phiri stumbles past. He has a miniature hoe, fashioned by his father, Lazaro, because he cried every time he saw his mother and father set off for the fields carrying tools and wanted one for himself. There seems an inevitability about the lives of these children.Without a pen and an exercise book, she could not do schoolwork, her teachers pointed out. But she lives with her older brother and his wife and baby and they have nothing. “I help them in the fields,” she said.She would go back if she could. “I would like to do nursing,” she said. Instead, she weeds, builds earth banks for the tobacco plants and sews the harvested leaves together to suspend them from branches so they dry in the air. Weeding is the worst. “It is a hard job,” she said.Tiyamike is just one of many children in Malawi who see little future beyond the tobacco fields. A report in 2011 estimated there were 1.3 million worldwide under the age of 14. The figures are hard to come by, but the International Labour Organization last year reported that child labour was on the increase, in spite of the tobacco companies’ protestations that they are working to end it. “Child labour is rampant,” the report said.These children live in the poorest of families. Tiyamike’s brother Madalitso Phiri, 27, took her in seven years ago after their father died. He doesn’t want her or the rest of his family to work in the tobacco fields. Like many of the tenant farmers, he sees tobacco as a cash crop that will give him a windfall at harvest time, with which he can change their lives. “I need to get capital so I can buy land and stand on my own two feet and my children can be brought up well,” he said. “I want my children to own shops and sell things.”It’s a dream the tenant farmers all nurture. That when the money comes in, they can go back to their home villages and buy land to farm for themselves or open businesses. But when the crop is sold, the money is never enough.Yeriko Phiri, 26, and his wife, Esther Banda, 20, thought their son, three-year-old Chifundo, had malaria. They took him to hospital, with a promise from their landlord that he would pay the bill. Eight days later, Yeriko was still working alone in the fields. He and his neighbours were very worried – without Esther’s help, he would not be able to get all the work done. In the end, Esther offered to leave her pots and plates, which she had been using to prepare food for herself and her son, with the hospital as surety. Then she set off on the 9km walk home, with Chifundo on her back.When she arrived home, the family were together again, but not smiling. “We haven’t had lunch today. We don’t have money to go to the mill to grind maize.”The families are given a weekly ration of maize, which they grind to a flour, mix with water and eat twice a day as a porridge. They are given salt and the tools they need, but have no cash unless they do extra piecework in the maize fields.Because he was alone, Yeriko could not do the piecework after working on the tobacco plot to afford the 300 kwacha (40 cents or 30p) to mill a pail of maize.The 17 tenant families – 18 including the farm manager – started the season in October and will work on the land for about 10 months until the crop is sold and they get their money.The leaf-buying companies, Alliance One, Universal – in Malawi known as Limbe Leaf – and the tobacco giant Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which does its own buying, grade the tobacco and decide the prices farmers are paid. The leaf buying firms say they tell contract farmers not to use children and that stopping child labour is a priority.In Malawi, the bales are transported by lorry to the auction halls in the capital, Lilongwe – a cost paid by the farmers. Most farmers are under contract to a leaf buyer. If they don’t take the price they are offered, they could put their bales up for auction but they risk not selling at all.Studies of the livelihoods of farmers in five low-income countries led by the economic and health policy research programme of the American Cancer Society in Atlanta, Georgia, have found that farmers at the end of a season just repay debts. “Unequivocally for the vast preponderance of these leaseholders, the livelihood is very bad,” said Jeffrey Drope, the programme’s vice-president.Farming tobacco to produce the leaf that fills cigarettes can involve: Drope said that families “admitted to pulling their kids out of school to work in handling tobacco directly without protection”. The children were exposed to wet leaves – with the danger of contracting green tobacco sickness – as well as fertilisers and pesticide, he said. The companies insist under-18s are only permitted to work with dry tobacco and that they have training policies to minimise risks with green tobacco“Handling dried tobacco is not considered as hazardous work,” JTI said.BAT says education is key on safe practices​ with green tobacco​ PMI\u0027s prevention advice includes wearing long sleeves, gloves or rainwear. A study in Malawi, headed by Donald Makoka of the Centre for Agricultural Research and Development in Lilongwe, found even the earnings of the contract and independent farmers who sublet to tenants were inadequate.For the tenant farmers, whose cheap labour substantially contributes to the profits made by the companies, it’s a grinding life of hard labour seven days a week. But it is only human to try to alleviate stress from time to time.In the farm the  visited in Kasungu, Isaac Mboba, 20, has made a guitar from an old vegetable oil canister and a piece of wood. “My aim was to become a musician … I never saw a guitar but I thought I could create my own musical instrument. I saw pictures in the newspapers.”Mboba sings as the children dance. “My friends, this is the world  Take care of it  People are not good  The whole world has problems  Help us, hold our hands  We are poor  Don’t leave us alone.”The tobacco industry says it is opposed to exploitative child labour. All the major companies contribute to the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco (ECLT) Foundation, set up in 2000, including Philip Morris International (PMI), BAT and JTI, as well as the leaf buyers Alliance One and Universal. The International Labour Organization, the only UN agency to have dealings and take funds for projects from the industry, is an adviser to the board. Because it is independent, the companies say, the foundation can require governments to take action.The companies say they have made it clear to farmers that they must not use child labour. PMI established a programme in 2011 “to improve labor practices and progressively eliminate child labor on all farms from which we purchase tobacco”. There is monitoring and countrywide assessments of labour practices and “engagement with stakeholders” for improvement.Green tobacco sickness is a form of nicotine poisoning that workers can be vulnerable to absorbing through their skin, especially if the leaves are wet because of rain, dew or sweat.What are the symptoms? Nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, headaches, and dizziness while farmers are working or several hours after work ends. Symptoms can last 24 hours extreme cases may require emergency help. Tobacco firms say they ban under 18s from hazardous work and only allow them to handle dry tobacco when there is no risk to health.How prevalent is it? One US study found about one in four workers harvesting tobacco in North Carolina suffered from green tobacco sickness in a single season.PMI funds the NGO Verité, which works towards “supply chain sustainability”, to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme, it says on its website.BAT says: “We have always made it clear to all our suppliers of tobacco leaf and contracted farmers that exploitative child labour and other human rights abuses will not be tolerated.”BAT says it commissioned a report from a development consultancy called DD International in 2012 which found tobacco farmers were not trapped in poverty but were increasing in prosperity. The report looked at 40 or so case studies in three countries – Brazil, Bangladesh and Uganda.BAT and JTI consider it acceptable for children of between 13 and 15 years of age to do light work on a family farm, provided it is light work permitted by local law. JTI quotes the ILO, which says: “Work that does not affect their health andor personal development, or interfere with their education, can generally be regarded as positive.”JTI says all its suppliers are assessed via the Sustainable Tobacco Programme. The company has a scheme called Arise (Achieving Reduction of Child Labor in Support of Education), which it says has taken more than 39,000 children out of child labor in Malawi, Brazil, Zambia and Tanzania since 2011.Alliance One says the elimination of child labour is a “top priority”. It purchases most of its tobacco from contracted farmers whom it can direct to comply with policies including “a prohibition against employing anyone under the age of 18 for hazardous tasks”. It seeks compliance through education and training and has more than 700 people in Malawi working on “agronomic and labor standards” with farmers. It also has a commitment to improving farmers’ incomes, it says.Universal says it takes “the issue of child labor very seriously” and is undertaking “significant efforts around the world to mitigate the risk of child labor in our supply chain”.Reporting and EditingSarah Boseley and Mark OliverDesignersJuweek Adolphe and Sam Morris"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3542272.1529869811!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s not my job to help theresa may on brexit says varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: ‘It’s not my job to help Mrs May’.

Roads are like those in Ireland before EU money. Photograph: Jacek Turczyk Sitting in a guest house in the heart of the Danube Delta, eating a delicious fish stew made with pike while a group of ethnic Russians performed a folk song-and-dance routine, was a memorable experience which illustrated the erse charms of Romania. A flock of pelicans landing in the lagoon outside the window completed the picture and showed why the Danube Delta is regarded as one of the wonders of the natural world.The Russians who cooked the meal and served the tables as well as performing are members of just one of the 17 ethnic groups who live in the Delta. Known as Lipovans they fled persecution in Russia more than 300 years ago when they refused to accept changes in the Orthodox Church.These “Old Believers” found sanctuary in the Delta, then part of the Ottoman Empire, where they lived in harmony with their Turkish Muslim and Romanian Orthodox neighbours ever since.The trip to the Delta was the highlight of a visit to Romania by a group of journalists invited for a briefing on that country’s presidency of the EU next year.Far from the political hurly burly of Bucharest, where there is an ongoing standoff between President Klaus Iohannis and the Social Democrat government, we were joined for lunch in the Delta by minister for tourism Bogdan Gheorghe Trif. He comes from the Sibiu, the same beautiful Transylvanian town as the president, but didn’t want to be drawn into a discussion about politics preferring to focus on the importance of tourism for the country’s development.Given the range of attractions from the Delta, Transylvania, Bucharest, Maramures and other less developed regions, the potential for tourism is enormous. Official figures show there were three million tourists last year. To put that in context, nine million tourists visited the Republic in 2017 and we are just one third the size of Romania.One of the big stumbling blocks to tourism development is the poor infrastructure. The roads are like those in Ireland before EU money helped to fund our motorway system.Driving those roads from Bucharest to the Delta or through Transylvania is as frustrating as it was here not so long ago but it does give the visitor a glimpse of the contrast between the old and new Romania. In the countryside there are reminders of Ireland in the 1950s with farmers using horses and carts, men and women hoeing fields of vegetables and hay being made with pitchforks.Yet evidence of rapid economic advance is all around. Bucharest is a thriving, bustling city and even in the small towns there are modern car showrooms as well as dealers selling the latest farm machinery.Writing about this country in the 1960s the great German writer Heinrich Boll remarked: “Ireland has leaped over a century and a half and caught up with another five.” Romania is now doing the same and in another parallel with Ireland, EU funding is prominently acknowledged in a way not common in most member states.The challenge facing the country is how to retain the best of the past while embracing the modern world. Romania needs to attract many more tourists to boost the economy but unrestricted tourism could pose a threat to the environment, particularly fragile wonders like the Delta or the wild forests of the Carpathians.The minister for tourism is aware of this conundrum. In an exchange with a journalist who questioned Romania’s commitment to protecting its bears, he pointed out politely that western Europe had wiped out its own bear populations centuries ago but was inclined to lecture Romania, which had not done the same, about how it should protect its bears and wolves.Back in Bucharest , minister for European affairs Victor Negrescu spoke about the challenges of the country’s EU presidency with negotiations on the EU’s budget for the next seven years and Brexit among the big issues.Negrescu was unequivocal in his backing for Michel Barnier’s approach to the Brexit negotiations. He expressed the hope that the EU would take a greater interest in the border with Moldova, which is naturally closer to Romanian concerns than the Irish one, but there is no sign of wavering on the basic EU position.The solidarity with Ireland shown by countries like Romania is a remarkable sign of EU cohesion. When the Brexit process has resolved itself, the onus will be on us to show similar solidarity by agreeing to an EU budget that provides the resources Romania needs to undergo a transformation similar to our own.

An epidemic is a fierce outbreak of a disease. The word causes panic because it sounds fast and frightening, but it also implies that it can, with enough effort and money, be quickly cured. Pressure groups love “epidemics”, because they allow them to demand that governments must “act now”. If their suggestions are implemented and do not work, they never apologise: they simply demand yet more drastic action.In our society, however, obesity is not epidemic, but endemic.

Sleep deprived, but really well, she said.Ms Ardern, 37, became New Zealand\u0027s youngest prime minister when she took office through a coalition deal last year after an inconclusive election. She has now become the first woman in the country\u0027s history to give birth while in office.She delivered her 3.31 kg (7.3 lb) daughter in the country\u0027s largest public hospital on Thursday afternoon with her partner, television presenter Clarke Gayford, at her side.Baby Neve sleeps through all the fussThe couple had settled on the baby\u0027s first name, Neve, after she was born, her mother said, explaining that it means bright and radiant and snow, which reflected that she was born in the middle of winter during the nation\u0027s indigenous Maori new year and the shortest day of the year.Her second name, Te Aroha, which means love in Te Reo Maori, one of the country\u0027s national languages, was a nod to the many Maori iwi, or tribes, that had offered names as a gift to Ms Ardern while she was pregnant.\u0027Te Aroha\u0027 was our way of reflecting the amount of love this baby has been shown even before she arrived, Ms Ardern said.The island nation, with a population of 4.5 million, was in the grips of a baby-induced glow of optimism in recent days with many social media users dubbing the baby the Prime Miniature while they waited for her name to be announced.It\u0027s just something really lovely in a world where so much is unfair that we\u0027re all very excited about it, said Frances Gerbic, a music teacher living in Auckland.Proud mum and dad speak to the mediaThe New Zealand Symphony Orchestra recorded a version of Brahm\u0027s lullaby Cradle Song translated into Te Reo Maori, and Auckland\u0027s tallest building, the Sky Tower, was lit up pink for three nights in honour of the occasion.Support also flooded in from around the world, with Britain\u0027s Queen Elizabeth, whom Ms Ardern met in London in April, sending an emailed message of congratulations and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeting at Ms Ardern: Pro tip, Jacinda: Briefing notes make excellent bed time stories.Ms Ardern will take the next six weeks off, leaving her deputy Winston Peters in charge, and return to work in early August when Mr Gayford will care for the baby full-time.Meet New Zealand\u0026#039s \u0026#039First Bloke\u0026#039: Clarke Gayford, the man who\u0026#039ll become a stay-at-home dadMany in New Zealand and around the world had held up her pregnancy - just the second time an elected leader had given birth in office since Pakistan\u0027s Benazir Bhutto in 1990 - as a symbol of progress for women.Hopefully these things that in these moments now are...a novelty...one day they aren\u0027t new any more, Ms Ardern said.I hope for little girls and boys that actually there\u0027s a future where they can make choices about how they raise their family and what kind of career they have that are based on what they want and what makes them happy.Murder probe in Bristol as two Londoners are arrested after man dies following report of burglaryPrince William visits Jordan ruins where Duchess of Cambridge was pictured as childMuslim herders kill 86 mostly Christian farmers in NigeriaChildren turned away from mental health help unless \u0026#39acutely suicidal\u0026#39, psychotherapists warnUK weather: Britain to bask in 30C during heatwave this week -

A group of 65 Hermes couriers took the delivery service to the tribunal after they said they had been denied basic workers’ rights such as the national living wage and holiday pay.The GMB union said the tribunal’s finding was a “landmark” ruling. Tim Roache, GMB general scretary, said: “This is yet another ruling that shows the gig economy for what it is - old fashioned exploitation under a shiny new facade. “Bosses can’t just pick and choose which laws to obey. Workers’ right were hard won, GMB isn’t about to sit back and let them be eroded or removed by the latest loophole employers have come up with to make a few extra quid.“Not only will this judgement directly affect more than 14,000 Hermes couriers across the country, it’s another nail in the coffin of the exploitative bogus self-employment model which is increasingly rife across the UK.”Frank Field MP, who chairs the work and pensions committee and previously delivered a scathing report on working conditions at Hermes, said the ruling “ranks among the most substantial judicial interventions ever to support vulnerable workers in this country”.The hidden cost of self-employmentDelivery company Hermes savaged in critical Frank Field report“Can even the World Cup produce a better result than this?,” he added.“The decision is a mega knockback to those companies still using old means of exploiting vulnerable workers.”A Hermes spokesperson said: We will carefully review the Tribunal’s decision, but we are likely to appeal it given that it goes against previous decisions, our understanding of the witness evidence and what we believe the law to be. \u0026nbsp“Nevertheless we have always been fully prepared for any outcome of this decision and its impact on 15 couriers and former couriers. \u0026nbspIn the meantime it is business as usual and we remain committed to providing couriers with the benefits of flexible working and the ability to earn well in excess of the National Living Wage.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.What if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor

But coming from the independent sector I think it would be good if all schools – states schools included – had more choice.”He claimed private schools were “not wedded to IGCSEs because they are more likely to result in higher grades” but because they are a “tried and tested success story in the lives of the young people we teach”.“They are not even included in league tables, so clearly this is not about showing off good results,” he added.\u0026nbspCambridge International Education, which sets the\u0026nbspIGCSE\u0026nbspexams, said it committed to aligning the standard of the\u0026nbspIGCSE\u0026nbspwith equivalent qualifications taken in England using “statistical evidence and comparability studies”.Around half a million 15 and 16-year-olds are taking the new\u0026nbspGCSEs, which have ushered in more difficult exam papers in most subjects, with a scale of 9 to 1 replacing the A* to G grading.The dramatic reforms come as part of a government drive to improve schools’, pupils’ and employers’ confidence in the qualifications, ensuring that young people have the knowledge and skills needed to go on to work and further study.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have reformed GCSEs to put them on a par with the best in the world so young people have the knowledge and skills they need to prepare them for future success and deliver the skills Britain needs to be fit for the future.“These new qualifications provide more rigorous content, greater stretch for the highest performers and are better preparation for studying A-levels, which are the main qualifications universities use when considering offers.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesHarry Kane celebrates scoring his second goal and England\u0027s fifth with teammates during their World Cup group game against Panama.

In a cowboy hat and T-shirt, Mr\u0026nbspAhmed had addressed the crowd in Meskel Square as supporters wore clothes displaying his image and carried signs saying “One Love, One Ethiopia”.Mr\u0026nbspAhmed told the tens of thousands of supporters that change was coming after years of anti-government tensions and there was no turning back. “For the past 100 years hate has done a great deal of damage to us,” he said, stressing the need for even more reforms. The 42-year-old entered office in April and went about introducing a swift package of liberalising reforms which surprised Africa’s second most populous country.He announced the release of tens of thousands of prisoners, the opening of state-owned companies to private investment and the unconditional embrace of a peace deal with rival Eritrea. “I’ve never thought this day will come in Ethiopia. I’m very emotional right now,” said Mulugeta Sema, a supporter of Mr\u0026nbspAhmed who wore a T-shirt with the new leader’s image. “We should never get back to dictatorship. This is time for change.” British man held on death row in Ethiopia for four years releasedEthiopia demands Britain return all country’s artefacts held by V\u0026ampAHowever, not everyone has supported the reforms. Some Ethiopians near the border with Eritrea have protested the embrace of the peace deal. Meanwhile, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, the dominant force in Ethiopian government for much of the past 27 years, said the peace deal had been made before the ruling coalition’s congress met to discuss it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He urged Indians to be proud of their culture and history.“The gems of India’s unique heritage, such as yoga, will be respected by the world at large only when we ourselves respect our culture and traditions,” he said.Around the world, public yoga events were held in Afghanistan, Japan and Peru, while Australia and South Africa celebrated on Monday.“From Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions,” Mr Modi told participants on the lush green lawns.“In a world where non-communicable diseases, stress and lifestyle related ailments are rising, yoga can play a central role in mitigating these diseases to create a healthy mind and body.”In the buildup to Thursday’s event, Mr Modi took part in a social media campaign, begun by his BJP party ministers, to get people to share videos of their fitness workouts on Twitter.Celebrities\u0026nbspfrom Bollywood actors to sports superstars\u0026nbspgot involved, and Mr Modi’s own video showed him performing yoga on a boulder in his prime ministerial gardens.Social media was again awash with videos emulating Mr Modi’s on Thursday, including from staff at Delhi airport, pupils at thousands of schools and members of India’s armed forces.Amid questions over his appeal, PM Modi’s party sweeps to key victoryPlea to Indian PM in London for ‘tortured’ captive elephants Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused of spying on citizens India PM makes point of visiting Palestinians after meeting NetanyahuThe Indian navy released pictures of sailors doing yoga on board the world’s oldest aircraft carrier, the INS Viraat, decommissioned last year, and soldiers guarding the world’s highest battleground, the Siachen glacier in northern Jammu and Kashmir state, did yoga routines at an altitude of around 18,000 feet.The events clearly mustered a huge amount of public support. For some, however, there was a sinister edge to having public institutions take part in a scheme closely associated with the prime minister’s messaging. Even prisons were involved, with 15,000 inmates due to take part in yoga events on Thursday in the capital alone.Sagarika Ghose, a prominent journalist and political commentator, wrote on Twitter: “Believer in yoga, try every morning, immense benefits. But concerned: why does a GOVERNMENT need to promote yoga? Yoga’s an inidual choice, a personal option.”Mr Modi’s rule, she said, was “fast becoming an escapist Bollywood film where song and dance attempt to distract from hard realities”. One of the most liked responses to Ms Ghose’s tweet told her to “go to Pakistan” if she couldn’t show loyalty to India.For Ajay Mehra, a political scientist at Delhi University, the International Day of Yoga “has become an imposition”, forced on the people by government.“Something like yoga should not be part of a political project,” he told The Independent, adding that there were certain yogic practices – chanting mantras for instance – that could be offensive to some groups in a plural society, “Muslims in particular”.Mr Mehra noted that Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, stressed the importance of secular, pluralist leadership while also being a devoted practitioner of yoga – “but he didn’t publicise it”.International Day of YogaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

An announcement from the broadcaster\u0026nbspTRT\u0026nbspcame soon after the\u0026nbspAnadolu\u0026nbspAgency, who reported that he had won 52.51 per cent of the vote with 98.4 per cent of the total counted.Independent election monitors and the opposition both maintained that less than half the votes had been counted at that point.\u0026nbspThe president’s main rival, Muharrem Ince -\u0026nbspwho state media\u0026nbspsaid had\u0026nbspwon 30.72 per cent of the vote -\u0026nbspurged\u0026nbspobservers and his supporters to stay on at counting centres, warning that vote rigging was\u0026nbsplikely to place if they left under the impression that the result had been decided.But speaking in the early hours of Monday, the head of the Supreme Election Council\u0026nbspSadi\u0026nbspGuven confirmed the result. He said\u0026nbspthat Mr Erdogan\u0026nbspreceived the absolute majority of all valid votes and the remaining ballots\u0026nbspwould not affect the outcome.In his speech Mr Erdogan\u0026nbsphad\u0026nbspwarned:\u0026nbsp“The Turkish public has mandated me as president according to unofficial results. I hope nobody will damage democracy by casting a shadow on this election and its results to hide their failure.\u0026nbspThe main opposition Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP)\u0026nbspdid not immediately concede defeat.\u0026nbspBut it moved from suggesting that Mr Erdogan\u0026nbspmight not win the 50 per cent required to avoid a run off against Mr Ince\u0026nbspto saying it would continue their campaign for democracy\u0026nbspwhatever the result.Mr Ince\u0026nbsptweeted that he would hold a press conference on Monday.During his address, Mr Erdogan\u0026nbsppraised the electoral process and pledged that economic progress would be made with a number of major infrastructure projects before thanking “ brotherly” countries which have already congratulated him.The\u0026nbspHungarian leader Viktor Orban, who has been condemned by fellow European Union states for a number of his hard-right policies, was the first to congratulate Mr Erdogan, it was reported. He was\u0026nbspfollowed by\u0026nbspPakistan\u0027s\u0026nbspPresident Mamnoon Hussain.At home, the Turkish president’s followers took to the streets lighting flares and hooting car horns. Supporters of the opposition parties were also gathering while their leaders insisted that the full count was yet to take place and Mr Erdogan may not reach the 50 per cent figure necessary to win outright, and avoid a second round run-off.Victory gives Mr\u0026nbspErdogan\u0026nbspa second five-year term and more power than any of his predecessors after a narrow referendum win last year. Mired in accusations of fraud, that referendum concentrated authority in the office of the president at the expense of parliament and the judiciary. The opposition want to review these constitutional changes which they say will create an autocracy. Under the new constitution, Mr\u0026nbspErdogan\u0026nbspcould serve a further term from 2023, taking him to 2028.World news in picturesSaudi women celebrate after they drove their cars in Al Khobar after the law allowing women to drive took effect.

Russian President Vladimir Putin walks before his President inauguration ceremony at the Kremlin in Moscow.There had been\u0026nbspfurther scepticism from the opposition about the results given by the state news outlets for the parliamentary poll running in tandem with the presidential one.\u0026nbspThe Kurdish rights\u0026nbspPeoples\u0027 Democratic Party\u0026nbsp(HDP) received 11 per cent of the vote which, it had been expected, would make opposition parties the majority in parliament. But the\u0026nbspNationalist Movement Party\u0026nbsp(MHP)\u0026nbspwhich is in alliance with Mr Erdogan’s\u0026nbspJustice and Development Party\u0026nbsp(AKP)\u0026nbspwas said to have received 11 per cent of the vote, twice as much as forecast by polls, giving the\u0026nbspruling coalition a majority.The AKP\u0026nbspwas said to have 42 per cent of the parliamentary vote, while the CHP\u0026nbsphad just under 23 per cent.In Istanbul, Mr Erdogan’s followers had no doubt about their leader’s victory. Alim Abdulhamit, waving an AKP flag outside the party headquarters, said: “This was never in doubt, he was always going to be on top, praise to Allah. It has now a fact and those who stood against us should accept it. They made a lot of noise, but the people chose President Erdogan who has done so much for us.”But watching the celebrations grim-faced, Adem Bulent, a 20-year-student and supporter of the CHP\u0026nbspwas convinced of \u0027dirty-tricks’.Erdogan tells a girl in military uniform that she would be honoured if killed while fighting“How can this be over? It is nor for the AKP to decide who wins, it is for the people, he said. What has happened has made many of us suspect even more that some fraud has gone on. Of course we are going to protest,” he wanted to stress.Defeat in the elections will be deeply demoralising for Mr Erdogan’s opponents who had fought a highly-energised and co-ordinated campaign and had repeatedly stated that they would be able to stop his march to what critics claim is an imperial presidency.Indeed, victory for Mr Erdogan in the presidential vote and the AKP in parliament was not the expectation among many who had turned up to vote during the day.\u0026nbsp“We are voting for our children’s future that is the reason we voted the way we did, we thought hard about it and I think we made the right decision”, said Nejat Bayan as he and his wife Pinar deposited their ballot papers. “There are a lot of things wrong right now, and strong action is needed, so these elections are crucial and we need the right result.”After supporting Mr Erdogan and the AKP all their adult lives, Mr Bayan and his wife were joining their daughter Buse in voting for the opposition CHP\u0026nbspand its candidate Mr Ince in the parliamentary and presidential elections. And they were\u0026nbspdoing so in one of the staunch AKP loyalist centres in Istanbul, at a polling station, Piyale Pasha Elementary School, where a young Recep was once a pupil.Voters hopeful for change on pivotal polling day for Turkey’s futureKurdish voters could hold key to Turkey\u0027s electionsTurkey opposition quietly optimistic ahead of presidential electionHow Turkey\u0027s elections will affect its struggling economyDoubts had\u0026nbspgrown every day since\u0026nbspMr Erdogan called a snap election 17 months early about the president\u0027s ability town.\u0026nbspEspecially against\u0026nbspan opposition which had\u0026nbspbeen galvanised and had\u0026nbspshown surprising unity, co-ordinating tactics and directing their members to vote strategically.Casting his\u0026nbsp own vote in Istanbul\u0026nbspMr Erdogan maintained that the country was experiencing a “democratic revolution”. While a group of supporters in the street chanted his name, he continued: “With the presidential system, Turkey has set the bar high concerning efforts to reach beyond the level of contemporary civilisation.”Estimates for voter turn-out were standing at as high as 87\u0026nbspcent of the electorate in many areas. More than 56 million eligible voters can make their choices in around 180,000 ballot boxes around the country. And it is what happens to these ballot boxes which had\u0026nbspraised concerns about rigging of the results.Reports were coming in however within a few hours of the polls opening of alleged fraud by Mr Erdogan’s supporters. A video was posted showing a ballot box being opened in Suruc district near the Syrian border, and disturbances temporarily stopping voting in the area where police also found four bags of stamped ballot paper in a car.Meral Aksener, the presidential candidate for the nationalist Good Party (iYi) - who are in parliamentary alliance with the CHP\u0026nbsp-\u0026nbspsaid: “We are urging the incident on Suruc very closely. I urge state officials to save the honour of the state”. Mr Ince declared “We need 36 hours of mobilisation to ensure that there is no electoral fraud.”\u0026nbspForeign observers are in Turkey to monitor the election. Both President Erdogan and the Prime Minister, Binali Yildirim, had criticised teams from the West, including from the\u0026nbspOrganisation for Security Cooperation in Europe\u0026nbsp(OSCE)\u0026nbspwith Mr Yildirim claiming they are “behave like spokespeople of radical political structures, we think this means interference in election one way or another.”The president and his supporters have avoided criticism, so far, of the\u0026nbspmonitoring team\u0026nbspfrom the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation Secretariat, which has Russia, China and India as members. Officials were inspecting polling stations in Istanbul and Ankara. Krishna Kengappa, one of the officials in Istanbul said a report would be produced showing\u0026nbsptheir conclusions on Monday.Some voters, while acknowledging the risk of fraud, were focusing on the strategic voting. Ozlem Dinles, an artist, is backing\u0026nbspHDP in the parliamentary poll, but will support Mr Ince of the CHP if there is a second round.\u0026nbsp“The aim is to get change, move Erdogan so we must find a way to that through voting. I have become more and more optimistic that this is possible” she said.The optimism was also prevalent at a polling station in Nisahantasi, a middle class enclave and a firm CHP base. A businessman in the tourism field said:\u0026nbsp “When Erdogan called the election I thought it will all be over very quickly, with the first round. But the opposition has learned to work together and we believe a second round will take place and Erdogan will go.” His partner, a food writer, added: “Yes, this really is happening we can see the opposition gaining support and Erdogan’s support slipping”. Neither wanted to go give their names however, there is fear of retribution if such\u0026nbspoptimism failed to\u0026nbspturn into reality.For Bahri, a taxi driver, the removal of Mr Erdogan was wistful thinking by his enemies. “He is going to win, I know that is going to happen. Seven out of ten people who use my taxi say they will vote for him and I will as well” he declared. “Europe had been stifling us, and now we are stifling them, and for that we need Erdogan”. It was nothing personal against Europe, Bahri wanted to add, “After all, I myself have just got an Oxford diploma in taxi driving.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I feel like I can do anything,” Bayan al Soumady says over the phone from Riyadh. The excitement in her voice is infectious.\u0026nbsp“I drove myself to work today.\u0026nbspMaybe it’s just a little thing, but everything feels like an adventure now.”The 24-year-old pharmacist is one of thousands of women across Saudi Arabia who took to the road for the first time on Sunday after the kingdom abolished its long-standing ban on women driving.\u0026nbspAs the clock struck midnight, in a show of solidarity and celebration, women did victory laps around the centres of Riyadh, Jeddah and\u0026nbspDammam,\u0026nbsptrailed by Saudi television crews and the rest of the world’s media.Throughout Sunday – the first day of the Saudi working week – women who had already managed to convert their foreign driving licences\u0026nbspstepped into newly purchased cars, or borrowed those belonging to fathers and husbands, to commute to work and run errands alone. Some headed out of the cities on the long, straight desert roads to drive fast for the pleasure of it.\u0026nbsp“Life can feel very complicated here sometimes,” says\u0026nbspBayan, who is half Syrian and learned to drive while\u0026nbspstudying in Damascus.\u0026nbsp“It’s frustrating not being able to rely on yourself for simple things like going to the supermarket 10 minutes away. I know it doesn’t fix everything – but being able to drive is a big step,” she adds.The historic moment gives women unprecedented freedom in a country where the male ship system effectively renders them second-class citizens, unable to make many important decisions for themselves.\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia’s tiny activist community has fought against the ban since it was enforced by police and licensing agencies in 1990. A surprise royal decree from King Salman last September, however,\u0026nbspannounced the end of a policy which has been perhaps the foremost symbol of the oppression faced by women in the conservative kingdom. The move, designed to help get more\u0026nbspwomen into the Saudi workforce, is part of a raft of wide-ranging social and economic reforms installed by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\u0026nbspin the year since his appointment.\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia struggles to employ its most-educated womenSAUDI WOMEN: Tahany Omar, 36, has a Masters of Business Administration from the US but has found the job market challenging in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia she works in an investment firm, but not in management.

Eight are still being held without access to their families or lawyers, and no charges have been brought against them.\u0026nbspDespite the crackdown, many ordinary Saudis embraced what one national newspaper called “history in the making”. \u0026nbsp“The logistics of half a country suddenly being able to learn to drive are quite something,” Susan Newbon, a British driving instructor training Saudi women to teach their own students, tells\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Honestly, I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s a very strange but very important occasion.”\u0026nbspSome women will have to wait a while to get behind the wheel\u0026nbspthere are huge waiting lists for gender-segregated lessons across the country, and a course of classes can cost hundreds of dollars.

Instead, like so much else in the country, it’s a combination of religious diktats, social pressure and purposefully convoluted licensing rules which has effectively stifled women’s freedoms and make it illegal for them to get behind the wheel.\u0026nbspWhen a royal decree goes into effect on Sunday, for the first time in decades, that is going to change.\u0026nbsp The independence is going to revolutionise life for many - including Pilar al Amad, from Kohbar, on Saudi Arabia’s east coast. If the rules had changed a few months earlier, she says her recent family tragedy may have been a little easier to deal with. \u0026nbsp“I was pregnant with twins and my husband was away with work when I went into labour,” she said.“I had to rely on people from work to drive me to the hospital and it was really stressful. I lost one of my twins a week after delivery. I feel like if I had just been able to drive the whole situation would have been easier.”Pilar’s surviving baby daughter has been in an intensive care unit for the last three months.Ahmed Yosri)“I can’t wait to be able to come and go as I please without having to go when my husband goes or else pay for an Uber,” she added.\u0026nbspLifting the driving ban is a deeply symbolic move in a country where ship system means that most decisions in a woman’s life are made for her by her father, husband or son.The kingdom’s newly appointed and immensely powerful crown prince, 32-year-old Mohammed bin Salman, is the driving force behind the new measure aimed at liberalising Saudi society - which will, crucially, bring more women into the workforce.Allowing women to drive is part of ‘Vision 2030’, an ambitious roadmap of socio-economic reforms designed to wean the kingdom off its dependence on oil revenue.\u0026nbsp Other bold moves include curbing the powers of the once notorious religious police and even a promise the conservative kingdom will return to a more “moderate” form of Islam.\u0026nbspBefore Prince Mohammed was appointed crown prince a year ago, such rapid change was unthinkable. In visits before and after his appointment, however, The Independent has witnessed how many ordinary Saudis have begun to relax into the changes.In the Red Sea city of Jeddah, more and more women are choosing to forego wearing headscarves altogether, and shops sell abayas - the cloak-like robe women must wear by law - in navy, grey and white as well as black. Even in the more conservative desert capital, Riyadh, people now blast Western pop music from cars and groups of teenagers - both boys and girls - roam around parks and malls unsupervised.\u0026nbspSunday’s historic moment is somewhat overshadowed by the arrests of 17 prominent women’s rights activists in the weeks leading up to the lifting of the ban.\u0026nbspWhile eight have been released on bail since, the rest have still not been charged and have not been allowed access to their families or lawyers.The arrests have widely been viewed as an attempt to intimate Saudi Arabia’s tiny activist community - and serve as a reminder to everyone that change in the kingdom will only come from the top down.\u0026nbspDespite the crackdown, though, excitement for Sunday is building. Newspapers and television stations across the country have gone into overdrive celebrating “history in the making”.\u0026nbspPink “ladies’ parking” spaces have sprung up in major cities and community events focussing on family road safety organised under the slogan “Tawakkali wa Intaliqi”, or ‘Have Faith and Drive”, are planned across the country tomorrow.Mabkhoutah al-Mari, 27, with her new driving license at the Saudi Driving School inside Princess Nora University on 23 June (APNariman El-Mofty)“Everyone is embracing the changes,” said Susan Newbon, a driving instructor from South Wales who is training up Saudi women to teach their own driving students and hold exams.\u0026nbsp“This is a young nation, where people know change is overdue. It’s logistically a massive undertaking but Saudis are more than ready to be able to do this. There’s a real sense of celebration.”Many challenges are still waiting in the wings. Complex rules on the mixing of genders in work and social environments mean it’s not clear whether women-owned businesses or female employees can mix with male customers and clients in certain industries the threat of harassment and backlash from religious conservatives is also a problem feared by many women.\u0026nbspThe long overdue social reforms are also being ushered in in part to sweeten a bitter pill: the House of Saud has been badly hit by a global plunge in oil prices since 2015.Saudi Arabia struggles to employ its most-educated womenSAUDI WOMEN: Tahany Omar, 36, has a Masters of Business Administration from the US but has found the job market challenging in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia she works in an investment firm, but not in management.

The government introduced its first-ever VAT (at 5 per cent) on 1 January and has begun phasing out fuel subsidies - meaning that while women will be able to get behind the wheel from next week, it will cost a lot to fill up the tank, and there aren’t enough jobs for everyone to drive to.Mohammed bin Salman’s reforms are more a continuation of the House of Saud’s long-term thinking than an out of the blue new agenda, David Butter, an associate fellow at London’s Chatham House, told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“Lifting the driving ban will provide a lot more scope for women to participate in the workforce and society,” he said. “But the changes do raise all sorts of questions.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They’ve far too much to discuss among themselves.”Migration is plunging European politics into crisis again. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition is threatening to break apart over the issue.While in Italy, the new government is threatening to close its southern border — blocking migrant rescue ships from landing — and open its northern border, encouraging illegal migrants and asylum seekers to head north to Germany and Sweden.So worried is European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that he is hosting a mini-summit tomorrow to try to find a solution to the migrant crisis which can help save Merkel’s political career.It is tempting to look at the EU in crisis and say that is why the UK is leaving. But this crisis is making it more difficult for Britain to get a reasonable Brexit deal.The European Commission is running the Brexit negotiations.Its priority is in defending the theology of the European Union, rather than finding practical solutions. As one leading figure in the Government laments to me, Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier “won’t budge off CETA (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) with Northern Ireland stuck in the customs union”.This kind of Canada-style free trade deal is regarded by the Government as inadequate.Mrs May and co have long hoped that the member states, nearly all of whose economies would be hurt by such a limited agreement, would intervene at some point and tell the Commission to engage more constructively with the UK. But this is happening all too rarely.One of the reasons is, in the words of one member of the Brexit inner Cabinet: “Only four national capitals are fully across Brexit.”Many of the countries that are most sympathetic to the UK don’t have the capacity to follow all of the issues concerned.Over the past few years, the key to any deal in Europe has been Merkel. She is not now going to ride to Britain’s rescue— as David Cameron found to his cost in the renegotiation.But the German Chancellor could push the Commission towards a slightly more pragmatic approach.However, she is now trying to keep her own governing coalition together, as well as come up with a deal with the French for eurozone reform, leaving next to no time for Brexit.I am told that when Brexit is discussed in meetings she is “visibly distracted”, turning to aides for advice far more frequently than she does on other issues.This situation is one of the many reasons why the Government should have prepared vigorously for no deal: A credible threat to walk away from the table if the Commission didn’t behave in a reasonable fashion would have got the member states’ attention.But Mrs May now must hope the EU can patch together some deal on migration and that the member states begin thinking seriously about what kind of post-Brexit relationship they want with this country.WHEN the Cabinet gathers at Chequers next month to thrash out the UK’s offer to the EU, one of the most contentious issues will be customs.The Brexit inner Cabinet is split between those who favour a so-called “new customs partnership” (NCP) with the EU – which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs after Brexit, with companies receiving a rebate if their goods stayed in Britain rather than heading to the continent – and those who advocate Max Fac, which would use technology to minimise border checks.Two Cabinet working groups are trying to find a way to make these ideas work. Neither group has had a decisive breakthrough yet. But I am told the Max Fac one is “not a million miles away” from a solution.The challenge for the PM is to make these plans acceptable to her own side, including David Davis and Liam Fox. One Brexit inner Cabinet member tells me: “She’s got to have David and Liam. If she doesn’t have them, then she has no solution.”Both Davis and Fox support the Max Fac option. But there are influential figures in No10 who remain convinced that NCP is the option to go for. They argue only NCP can help deal with the Irish border issue and get the Government through next month’s crucial Commons votes on the customs union. They warn: “No NCP, no Brexit.”The fear among Brexiteers is Mrs May will use this Chequers meeting to try to push through a modified version of NCP. They fear the reason the whole Cabinet will be present on the second day is to give Mrs May the numbers to do this if the Brexit inner Cabinet remains split on the issue.Doing this, though, would be extremely risky. It would leave Mrs May with a policy that neither her Brexit Secretary nor her International Trade Secretary support.THE Chancellor and the Defence Secretary aren’t just split over how much money the military should get, but what it should be spent on, too.One Cabinet ally of Philip Hammond’s complains that Gavin Williamson wants to “spend the money on uniformed officers when he should be spending it on robotics and the like”.Their view is that this would be a better response to the 21st-century security challenges Britain faces.But in truth, Britain needs both conventional and new, hi-tech forces if it is to respond to the variety of threats now out of there. That is why we MUST spend more on defence.Those close to Williamson point out that if the Government doesn’t increase the defence budget, our status as the leading military spender in Europe – upon which so much of our influence in the world depends – will be under threat as the French and the Germans increase their military budgets.NEXT week, Theresa May will give a speech setting out the Government’s post-Brexit industrial strategy.Key to this must be artificial intelligence, an area where we are one of the leading nations in the world.I understand that the importance of maintaining the UK’s edge in AI is what led to Mrs May accepting Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Digital Secretary Matt Hancock’s argument that visa rules for tech entrepreneurs must be relaxed.The countries that succeed at AI will end up defining this century.So any deal with the EU must preserve the UK’s ability to regulate these industries of the future in a way decided by us, not Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She could be the most important discovery of the 21st Century.The bodies were handed over to the Inkari Institute in Cusco, Peru, in April 2017.The institute investigates archaeological discoveries connected to the Inca civilisation.Unlike the other bodies, “Maria” was much larger, had all her organs, finger and toe prints.Thierry Jamin, president of the Inkari institute, believes Maria could have been a hybrid between a human and an alien race - known as the Greys - but Steve has dismissed this claim.Another body, possibly that of a four-year-old child, also had three fingers and toes all the bodies were covered in a strange white powder.Steve and fellow researcher Barry Fitzgerald flew out to the south American country in July last year to interview key players.During their trip they were taken to a secret location high in the Andes to see the different sized bodies for themselves.Dressed in surgical gowns, they examined X Rays and the bodies themselves.It comes after press conference was held in Lima back in March to announce the discovery to the worlds media - before any DNA results were known.Steve believes “Maria” is the only real body among the mysterious  collection - but believes she may have been professionally altered by grave robbers so she would be worth more on the black market.We set most of our investigation on Maria as she is clearly a body, not a mummy as listed many times because she has her internal organs,” he said.Our scientists and professors of Genetech Laboratory in Sri Lanka confirm that Maria has a very unusual DNA. “It has been discovered that she is 98.5% primate, (like humans) 1.5% unknown. She also has a huge mutation in her genes that cannot be identified to any known disease.The grave robbers dug up a body 1400-1800 years old and more than likely had her professionally altered not knowing she was already special due to her DNA. “This could represent a new form of human. “An amazing scientific discovery that may be lost to the world due to human greed.”Steve believes Marias eye sockets may have been altered by a professional taxidermist so she looks like she has wider eyes and had finger bones.She also has an elongated skull - but Steve believes this is dues to the boarding process - where babies were tied to boards in order to stretch out their skulls.However he believes some remarkable features such as horizontal dermal ridges, an absence of ears and large lower canine teeth - are real.Steve says that his team are the only ones who have managed to obtain authentic DNA results.He said: ”Samples were taken by doctors in Peru that were guided by our scientists. A full chain of custody obtained. “We believe we are the only ones with a chain of custody. Without this, the DNA samples cannot be proven to be the correct ones and untampered. “Simply, without chain of custody, any analysis is pointless. We got this.When viewing scans, photos, videos and X-rays, our scientists could not identify any anatomical alteration. That does not mean it does not exist.”The bodies were also covered in diatomaceous earth which Steve believes was purposely applied to the bodies to possibly cover up evidence of alteration.Steve says that during his trip he uncovered a thriving black market ring to illegally pillage graves and create unusual looking creatures and pass them off as “aliens”.He says there is now a £1million price tag on Marias head on the international black market.We took on this case to disprove many of the unscientific claims that these mysterious bodies were in fact extraterrestrial in origin, and we have managed to do exactly that - except for the large Maria body.Steve and Barry are now desperately trying to have Maria released to the Peruvian government.He said: We were in communications with the Mayor of Nazca who wants the bodies released and placed in a museum in Nazca. “Authorities continue to search for the bodies and had even developed a task force called Task Force Wawita.We know where these bodies are being kept and the preservation of these bodies is extremely important. “The bodies are degenerating fast. Also there are a number of other parties hellbent of convincing the general public that all the bodies represent living and breathing hybrid reptilian aliens. “This is simply not true and must end. Lab reports by others involved are questionable and even the credentials of doctors involved. “The amazing discovery within the DNA of Maria deserves the upmost academic attention and nothing less.Steve and Barry are producing a three-part documentary revealing their findings.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is staggering that the ­Government is still undecided on ­fundamental principles.But the Tories’ woes were hugely exacerbated by their election calamity, caused in part by Remainers hoping Labour would betray Brexit.That emboldened diehards in the Lords and Commons — operating alongside the lavishly-funded, slickly orchestrated campaign colluding with Brussels to annul the biggest vote in our history.Meanwhile the national conversation has degenerated into a tsunami of hate, chiefly from sanctimonious Remainers branding Leavers uneducated racists.How much better off we would all now be if on June 24, 2016 they had grudgingly accepted defeat and pledged instead to make the best of Brexit.In fairness, some Remainers did. TV’s Richard Madeley spoke for them recently when he said we now had a duty to see it through in full by leaving the single market and customs union.He was right. To pretend that Brexit can be “softened” to honour the substantial Remain vote — a nightmarish fudge which Boris Johnson warns of today — is simply dishonest. There is leaving and there is remaining. That’s it.Brussels has revelled in Britain tearing itself apart. Now it is sidetracked by its own problems. A deal looks miles off.Theresa May has only one path forward. At next month’s pivotal vote, she must defeat the backbench rebellion hoping to shackle us to a customs union restricting our trading future. That is not Brexit, as voters would quickly realise. It would reignite the Leave ­campaign with unprecedented ferocity.And the PM and her Cabinet must not be derailed by Remain-fanatic businesses muttering about pulling out. Previous such threats have proved bogus, like all those dire economic forecasts.Leaving may not be smooth in the short-term. That must not deter us.When the EU finally realises Brexit in full is inevitable maybe they will stop playing games and agree a deal.But if the Remain resistance succeeds in crippling Brexit, it will bring on chaos.Our current divisions will seem like happy hour. And it will be their fault.HEARTBREAKING, isn’t it, to see Argentina in disarray and the Germans wobbling at the World Cup?

I’m out of here.”Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith has told Mrs May to turn the tables on “bullying” Eurocrats when she returns to Brussels this week.He believes she is in her strongest ­position yet to get them to discuss their relationship with Britain when we leave on March 29 next year.In the 15 months since Article 50 was triggered, they have refused to discuss trade while our own MPs argued among themselves.But Mrs May’s hand was strengthened last week after she saw off the rebels to get the EU Withdrawal Bill through ­Parliament.Tory MP Mr Duncan Smith warned she must show her mettle as she faces the biggest test of any PM in peacetime at next week’s Brussels showdown.He told The Sun on Sunday: “Theresa May now has the upper hand in these talks.They have been watching us fight among ourselves over Brexit for months and didn’t have to do anything because her position was so weak.“They knew there was an outside chance it wouldn’t happen, so they’ve dug in on all the practical stuff such as trade and bogged us down with other details.“But now it has been voted through. We are leaving. They cannot stop it.“I’ve advised Theresa to tell them bluntly to agree to talk about trade or she is leaving.“If they refuse to engage, she must have the resolve to get up and leave the table — making clear she will take our ­£40billion contribution with her.“Theresa must put her cards on the table and tell them she wants to talk about trade now.“If they tell her they don’t want to, she should put her business card on the table and say ‘Tell you what.There’s my ­number. Give me a buzz if you change your minds.Meanwhile, we’ve got nothing more to say to you’.“Then she should turn to her aides and say, ‘We can catch the ten past six if we hurry now.Can you get some cars because we’re on our way.We’ve got work to do. Nice to see you all. OK, guys. Take care. Goodbye!’“That will bring them to their senses rather quickly.“The 27 other EU countries are desperate for a deal so they can sell us their cars, cheeses and potato products.“They’ve tried to push us around for the past couple of years but Theresa has the upper hand now and she must show them who’s boss.”Slamming the way EU officials have treated Britain as “disgusting”, Mr Duncan Smith said: “Undiplomatic doesn’t begin to cover it.“They’ve done their level best to ­humiliate and be rude to us. They are meant to be our friends and allies.”Singling out chief negotiator Michel Barnier, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and ­European Parliament co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, he added: “Come this week, we can tell them their days of behaving like ­playground bullies are over.”He said Wednesday’s flagship vote was THE most significant bill passed in the Commons since the treaty to join the fledgling ­European Economic Community in 1973.Crucially, it removes any chance of Brexit being derailed and the clock really has begun ticking towards our departure in 278 days.Brexiteers now warn that the PM must finalise a deal by November, to leave time to clear it all by February.Mr Duncan Smith said: “She is in a stronger position than she’s been in for some months.Getting the most critical bit of legislation through last week means she goes to the European Council knowing our departure is now settled.“That means she is back in charge of the negotiation and there is no way they can stop Brexit.“Now it’s down to raw negotiation, and the question facing the EU is how much they want to have a good relationship.“We do, and the Prime Minister has been open about that. But she has to be ready to walk away.“I’ve done negotiations in business and that’s what you do. You say, ‘There’s nothing on the table that I can agree to here. Sorry, I’m off’.“Never buy a car until you’ve attempted to walk out of the showroom at least twice.There is no better way to get the price down than to say, ‘I’m off, it’s too expensive, I’ll go somewhere else.’It’s not so much calling their bluff. It’s calling them out.“It’s kind of like poker — and Theresa has to force them to show their hand.”Last week’s decision to pump an extra £20billion into the NHS — partly funded by savings from EU contributions — will also send a clear message to Brussels that Britain is leaving.Mr Duncan Smith said: “It’s a down-payment that says we have to leave.“It shows she knows we’re leaving and we won’t be paying them any more money after a set time.”But has Mrs May got what it takes to face down the Brussels bully boys?Mr Duncan Smith said: “I think she has the steel to surprise them.“We’ve seen before what she’s like when she really digs her heels in.

held more than a year early - completes Turkeys transition from a parliamentary government system to a presidential one following a referendum last year.Erdogan delivered his victory speech to flag-waving supporters from the balcony of his ruling AK Partys headquarters in Ankara shortly after 3am.He said: Starting tomorrow, we will start working to realise the promises we made our people.“The winner of this election is each and every individual among my 81 million citizens.Erdogan also pledged that authorities, who have waged a nationwide crackdown since a failed military coup two years ago, would act more decisively against terrorist organisations.WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR...The president added that Turkish forces would continue to liberate Syrian lands so that the 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey could return home safely.Erdogans victory paves the way for another five-year term and under the new constitution, he could serve a further term from 2023, taking him to 2028.Supreme Election Council head Sadi Guven said early on Monday, 97.7 per cent of votes had been counted and declared Erdogan the winner.Guven said that based on unofficial results, five parties passed the threshold of 10 per cent of votes required for parties to enter parliament.Cheering Erdogan supporters waving Turkish flags gathered outside the presidents official residence in Istanbul, chanting: Heres the president, heres the commander.Cihan Yigici, an Erdogan supporter in the crowd, said: Justice has been served!Left wing rival Muharrem Ince, who won 31% of the vote, has yet to officially concede defeat.His Republican Peoples Party said it believed the election could go to a second round, moments before Erdogan claimed victory.Thousands of jubilant supporters of the pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party, or HDP, also spilled into the streets of Diyarbakir after unofficial results showed the party coming in third.The party received 11.5 per cent of the legislative vote - surpassing the 10 percent threshold needed to enter parliament.Supporters of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan attend his election rally in IstanbulThe HDPs performance was a particular success since presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas, eight more of its lawmakers and thousands of party members campaigned from jails and prisons.HDP says more than 350 of its election workers have been detained since April 28.The imprisoned Demirtas, who has been jailed pending trial on terrorism-related charges, was in third place in the presidential race with 8.3 per cent of the vote, according to Anadolu.Revellers waved HDP flags and blared car horns, while one supporter, Nejdet Erke, said he had been waiting for this emotion since morning.Erdogan insisted the expanded powers of the Turkish presidency will bring prosperity and stability to the country, especially after a failed military coup attempt in 2016.A state of emergency imposed after the coup remains in place.Some 50,000 people have been arrested and 110,000 civil servants have been fired under the emergency, which opposition lawmakers say Erdogan has used to stifle dissent.The new system of government abolished the office of prime minister and empowers the president to take over an executive branch and form the government.He will appoint ministers, vice presidents and high-level bureaucrats, issue decrees, prepare the budget and decide on security policies.The Turkish Parliament will legislate and have the right to ratify or reject the budget.With Erdogan remaining at the helm of his party, a loyal parliamentary majority could reduce checks and balances on his power unless the opposition can wield an effective challenge.The presidents critics have warned that Erdogans re-election would cement his already firm grip on power and embolden a leader they accuse of showing increasingly autocratic tendencies."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000002577661.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"british army could use inflatable tanks","story":"Russia and America already use them to fool satellites and drones.An official study of urban warfare found we should deploy inflatables to boost “deception capability” and to make up for a lack of troops.Up to 65 senior officers, led by Lt-Gen Patrick Sanders, took part in a study in Germany this month.They were asked to examine what urban warfare technology Britain would need by 2035.The Army’s ageing fleet of Challenger 2 tanks was slashed from 325 to 227 after the 2010 defence review.

On the contrary, it is more compassionate because it gives pupils the space to learn and grow.“Our pupils welcomed the change because it relieved them of the burden of being online the whole time.“They found they had more freedom, more time for contemplation. ‘We don’t miss our phones at all,’ a group of Year 9 pupils told me.”The ban sees pupils in years seven, eight and nine, (approximately from ages 11-14) required to hand their phones in to teachers at the start of the day.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt included the ban in a raft of new proposals to cut childhood obesity, including a 9pm watershed on junk food adverts. Jamie, 42, who has campaigned alongside us for a ban, said: “I really think this was driven by the strong support of the Mirror and its readers. These drinks are not fit for kids and are affecting not only them negatively but also classrooms around the country. This is a great move for better child health but also a great move to support our teachers to help kids learn. We need to keep supporting this in the consultation.”  The ban on selling caffeine and sugar-laden drinks, such as Red Bull, to under-16s is included in Mr Hunt’s draft policy which aims to halve childhood obesity by 2030. Mr Hunt was appalled at figures showing energy drinks were being consumed by 25% of six to nine-year-olds. His proposals will be subject to consultation before a final decision. Mr Hunt said: “It is near impossible to shield children from exposure to unhealthy foods. Parents are asking for help. It’s our job to give them power to make healthier choices. The cost of obesity – on individual lives and our NHS – is too great to ignore.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labour vows bring huge defence","story":"NewsLabour vows to bring huge defence contracts back under state control in major new policyShadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith will reveal the party’s plan to scrap deals with outsourcing giants - as she insisted Trident would be kept\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor00:01, 25 JUN 2018Updated00:03, 25 JUN 2018NewsShadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith will reveal the party’s plan (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBumper Ministry of Defence contracts will be brought back in-house by a Labour government, military experts will be told today. Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith will reveal the party’s plan to scrap deals with outsourcing giants in a bid to raise standards. The frontbencher will point to a series of disasters involving multimillion-pound contracts between MoD the private sector after the Tories hived off deals as they tried to save cash. Ms Griffith, who has held her post since October 2016, has said Labour would back sending more troops to Afghanistan to continue the fight against the Taliban. She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr the party would not not reverse its decision to keep Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent despite Jeremy Corbyn’s well-publicised opposition to the programme.  The Welsh MP stressed it was party policy to support the nuclear deterrent, saying this was not the time to be “descaling” it. She said: “I think if you look at the world today it’s a more uncertain place than it’s ever been. I think if you look at the way the United States is not stepping up to the mark, I don’t think this is the right time to be getting rid of our nuclear deterrent. Vowing an immediate review of existing contracts and a ban on awarding new deals, Ms Griffith will tell the Royal United Services Institute think tank today: “The next Labour government will get to grips with outsourcing at the MoD. “Upon taking office, we will carry out a root and branch review of significant service contracts that have been outsourced by the Department. “And where they are not delivering, where they are failing our personnel and their families, or failing to provide value for money to British taxpayers, we will have no hesitation in bringing these contracts back in-house.  “And we will call an immediate halt to the significant contracts that are currently being considered for outsourcing, with Labour introducing a clear presumption in favour of public contracts being delivered by the public sector.” The pledge comes after the Government’s decision to hand a contract for the Defence Fire and Rescue Service to Capita, despite the company achieving the highest possible risk rating in an internal MoD assessment. The firm was recently stripped of its contract to run MoD military estates, while its deal to run for recruitment to the Army has been plagued by problems, leaving the Service 5,000 troops below strength. Meanwhile, Service families have repeatedly complained of broken boilers, rattling windows and mouldy walls in homes where a private firm is responsible for upkeep.

The incumbent leader won an absolute majority with 97.2 percent of the votes counted, Turkey\u0027s High Electoral Board (YSK) confirmed. Unofficial results broadcast on Turkish television also gave his ruling party and its alliance partner a majority in parliament. Spokesman Sadi Guven added that the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) had passed the 10 percent threshold needed to enter parliament. The main opposition party did not immediately concede defeat. But after initially saying Erdogan would fall well short of a first-round victory, it said simply it would continue its democratic struggle whatever the result.  Erdogan addressed supporters in a victory speech from the balcony of his ruling AK Party\u0027s headquarters in Ankara. Starting tomorrow, we will start working to realise the promises we made our people, Erdogan told flag-waving supporters. He also pledged that authorities, who have waged a nationwide crackdown since a failed military coup two years ago, would act more decisively against terrorist organisations.  Erdogan, 64, added that Turkish forces would continue to liberate Syrian lands so that the 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey could return home safely. Sunday\u0027s vote ushered in a powerful new executive presidency, putting more power in Erdogan\u0027s hands Turks narrowly backed the shake-up in a referendum last year.  Erdogan\u0027s victory paves the way for another five-year term. Under the new constitution, he could serve a further term from 2023, taking him to 2028. Critics say extending his powers will further erode democracy in Turkey, which is a NATO member state. An unexpectedly strong showing by the AK Party\u0027s alliance partner, the nationalist MHP, could translate into the stable parliamentary majority that Erdogan seeks in order to govern freely. This sets the stage for speeding up reforms, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek tweeted of the results. His main rival, Muharrem Ince of the opposition Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP), had earlier urged election monitors to remain at polling stations to guard against possible fraud.  Yesterday, a crowd of Erdogan\u0027s supporters chanted his name as he emerged from a school after voting in Turkey\u0027s largest city Istanbul, shaking hands with people amid tight security. Turkey is staging a democratic revolution, he told reporters in the polling station. With the presidential system, Turkey is seriously raising the bar, rising above the level of contemporary civilisations.

So what better time to explore the UK and take in some of the country’s most breathtaking bike rides?\u0026nbspShareByHolly Thatcher14:24, 22 JUN 2018Updated21:07, 23 JUN 2018Advertorial (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWe\u0027ve been blessed with some decent weather already in 2018 - but this week is when summer *officially* begins. June 21, the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, is the longest day in the year - affording us approximately 17 hours of daylight. Technically, this also means that the nights will start drawing in again now - so there\u0027s really no time like the present to get out and explore the great outdoors on some of the country’s most breathtaking bike rides. We\u0027ve taken a look around the UK to find the best places to watch the sun setting. 1. Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, Fraserburgh, Scotland  A small village called Maud in Aberdeenshire offers a starting place for a traffic-free cycle to the coast. If you\u0027re in the mood to learn then head to the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses in Fraserburgh. The sun will set at around 10.12pm this week in this part of Scotland, so you\u0027ve got loads of time to enjoy the start of the summer. Bike need replacing?   If your existing bike needs replacing, you\u0027ll want something efficient and speedy for the roads - like the Carrera Parva Hybrid bike , which comes in versions for both men and women and is now just \u0026pound210 (a saving of \u0026pound90). And if you don\u0027t need a new bike, why not have yours checked over before setting off. Like any mode of transport your bike needs to be looked after and regularly checked for wear and tear. Halfords offers a 32-point Free Bike Check which includes:  Frame, saddle and handlebar Wheels including tyres, rims, spokes and hubs Brake system including levers, calipers, pads and cables / hoses Drivetrain including gears, levers, chain, bottom bracket, cranks and cables  2. The Eden Project, Cornwall   Why not spend the day enjoying the amazing sights at the Eden Project? Best of all, if you arrive by bike you\u0027ll get a discount on entry. The sun sets on Eden at around 9:30pm on the solstice. Bear in mind though that the Eden Project shuts at 6pm, so you\u0027ll need to watch the sun go down somewhere nearby.  Get there in style on the Carrera Subway 1 Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound300. With easy to use 24 speed Shimano gearing, your effort for building speed will be minimised on all terrains, while its lightweight aluminium frame means you can quickly and efficiently ride to your destination. Camping out?   Planning to camp? Be sure you book in advance as you won\u0027t want to be without a pitch. Croft Farm Holiday Park is just a mile from the Eden Project and three miles from the beach. Pentewan Sands is also nearby and boasts amazing family facilities - as well as the nearby Pentewan Cycle Trail. Consider taking a Halfords Vis A Vis 4 Person Tent with you, which is currently reduced to just \u0026pound60, (was \u0026pound150, save \u0026pound90). The simple tunnel design is easy to pitch in approximately 20 minutes. With two separate bedrooms and a living area, it\u0027s perfect for families or groups of friends. For additional comfort pack an Urban Escape Folding Table And Bench Set , \u0026pound40 (was \u0026pound50, save \u0026pound10) which folds down into a single carry case to make it easy to transport and store.  3. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales  The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is an absolutely beautiful part of Wales and a stunning place to watch the sun go down. There are loads of campsites in the area, including some unique places to stay. There are plenty of bike routes too, with some offering traffic-free options if you want a more peaceful ride. In Pembrokeshire you can expect the sun to set around 9:39pm. Why not try..   The Boardman ADV 8.8 Adventure Bike , \u0026pound750, is a bike truly made to help you explore new possibilities. This bike is adept at riding in comfort on roads but really excels when you want to get off the beaten track.   4. White Nancy, Cheshire   Located on Kerridge Hill, White Nancy is a local landmark from which you can see all around the area, from Wales to the west and the Pennines to the north. From time to time White Nancy is painted to look like other things, like a Christmas pudding or with Olympic rings when London hosted in 2012. The sun will set over White Nancy at around 9:36 this week. Need to drive?  Heading further afield to enjoy the sunny days? If you\u0027re packing up the whole family into the car for a camping trip, make sure it\u0027s in good running order first. A Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest. Book online or just pop in to your local Halfords store and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up too.  If you\u0027re making an unfamiliar journey, don\u0027t forget to get the Garmin Drive Sat Nav , \u0026pound79.99 (was \u0026pound99.99, save \u0026pound20.99). With lifetime map updates you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road. 5. Edinburgh Castle, Scotland  There are few places that are as stunning as Edinburgh Castle, located atop Castle Rock. The views of Edinburgh from the castle are amazing, and a great place to watch the end of the day roll around. Sunset here will take place at 9:58pm. 6. Hampstead Heath, London  The scenery on Hampstead Heath always pleases the eye. This amazing part of London has views of every landmark you could hope for and it\u0027s a wonderful place to watch the sun go down. This will happen at around 9:18pm in the capital.   7. Osborne House, Isle of Wight   The home of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert is quite a sight to see. Accessible by bike (and ferry, if you\u0027re not an island resident), it\u0027s the ideal place to see during the day before you settle down somewhere to watch the sunset. If you\u0027re up for the cycle, Shanklin Chine on the west of the island is well worth an evening visit.  Do it with ease - and classic style - on the Pendleton Somerby Electric Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound750. With added electrically powered pedal assistance, it delivers 40 - 50 miles of range through a rear hub motor with speed sensor. This extra power is enough to guarantee effortless rides, taking the strain out of hills and making moving off from a standstill much easier. If you prefer, this bike is also available in a non electric version and in a range of colours - we love the mint green ! The sunset starts at 9:18pm near Osborne House and 9:17pm in Shanklin Chine.  8. Ness Point, Lowestoft    Ness Point is the UK\u0027s most easterly point. This makes it a great place to ride to on National Cycle Route 1. Make yourself comfortable on the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (half price) and watch the waves crash in as the sun goes down. Sunset is 9:16 at the UK\u0027s most easterly point.  9. Blackpool Pleasure Beach, Lancashire   With plenty of places to cycle in the area you could have an amazing day out in Blackpool. Start with a ride to the Pleasure Beach, and have some fun with the kids (or without them!) on the roller coasters. When all that\u0027s done you can have fish and chips while the sun sets on another day. The sun will go set at around 9:43 in Blackpool.  10. Cotswolds, England  Spread over six counties there\u0027s a lot to see in the Cotswolds. Consider taking a ride through the picturesque Castle Combe to take in the amazing houses and the stunning market square. The sun sets on this beautiful village at 9:26pm  Find your way by car - and beat the traffic   If you\u0027re driving to somewhere new then why not add a sat nav to your car? The TomTom GO 6200 , \u0026pound270, (was \u0026pound339.99, save \u0026pound69.99) adds real-time traffic information to the navigational benefits of a sat nav (smartphone required for this feature).   11.

Husband and wife team Katherine and Adam Wooler fell in love with the location of the abandoned chalet off Whitsand Bay, and rebuilt it from the bottom up after negotiating with Cornwall Council to overturn strict planning laws.  Called Seaglass , it comes complete with a natural spa, including a hot tub and heated outdoor shower with a beautiful view of the sea.   It also boasts posh skylights, bi-fold doors that look out onto the ocean, Cornwall Live reports.   The Wooler\u0027s rent it and last year alone raked in \u0026pound123,000 from holiday makers - who have even been known to touch down in a private helicopter. But they\u0027ve decided the time is now right to sell the freehold of the posh apartment as the family enjoys a new start in New Zealand. It\u0027s available to buy right now - but you\u0027ll need a cool \u0026pound850,000 in your back pocket.  Katherine said: The chalet had to be a similar size to the previous one bedroom chalet, but it was the size of the plot that really attracted us and the sense of isolation from the other chalets dotted along the cliff. It was initially our intention to live there but with the arrival of our baby, Ella-Rose, we decided to turn it into a holiday let. Having previously converted another chalet on the cliff into a holiday let, we were aware of the potential and growing demand in Whitsand Bay - also locally know as ‘Cornwall’s forgotten corner’. We purchased the property in July 2013 and had our first holiday let booking on New Years Eve 2013. We lived in Dorset during the build and were doing day round trips to Cornwall to oversee the build - with a six-month-old baby.

Mum-of-two Amy Stevens said they thought they were going to die and her children were petrified following the horrendous incident.  Amy and partner Lee Jeffrey have no idea why around eight balaclava-clad men should target their  property in Whitleigh, Plymouth, which left children Shanella, aged 11, and Amelia, aged seven, traumatised.   It is believed there was also damage caused to the home of a 96-year-old neighbour during the incident, Plymouth Live reports.   The couple now have a repair bill of more than \u0026pound1,000 but say that pales when they think of what could have happened to their children. Shanella had not long left the bathroom when the window was smashed, showering the room with glass. And if Lee, 33, had not locked the front door of the couple’s flat when he saw the men approaching, the couple fear they could have come inside and caused mayhem. “You can fix a window, but if Lee had not been able to lock the front door in time and my daughter had still been in the bathroom I dread to think what would have happened,” said 31-year-old Amy.  “It was awful, the children are shaking every time there is a knock at the door now, but, to be honest, I am too.” Police are investigating the incident but have yet to identify the men involved or the vehicle they escaped in. They are also trying to work out the motive for the attack. The incident happened in the same street where police are still investigating the cause of a blaze which damaged two cars on June 1. Arson has hot been ruled out.  Amy and Lee have no connection to that incident and are mystified as to why anyone should want to attack their property or the family. The drama unfolded at about 11pm on June 23, when Lee was watching TV in the front room of the ground-floor, two-bedroom flat. “He was on the sofa and heard a massive banging and shouting outside,” said Amy. “He looked out and saw about eight men in balaclavas and rushed to lock the front door.  “Then the men started batting hell out of the windows. The smashed all of them.” She said the front door window, another window and all the panes in the bathroom window were smashed. “It was like something you would see on Crimewatch. “They have caused about \u0026pound1,000 of damage.” Police reacted quickly to the incident as soon as the family rang in.

Tea and coffee aren\u0027t being served during flights, and passengers have been told to bring their own bottled water on board. Passengers told how their flights were delayed for up to two hours because the water supply was contaminated and the crew were waiting for a delivery of bottled water. One passenger said a pilot announced every plane on the tarmac was affected.  Actress Rebecca Mansfield told : There was an issue with the water that’s been uploaded to all the planes on the tarmac, so they all had to receive bottled water before take off. We’ve been delayed by over an hour waiting for one solitary crate of Harrogate water bottles to arrive. No tea or coffee on board, and no running water in the bathroom but they’re providing hand sanitiser.   We don’t know what the issue with the water is but it hasn’t affected the airport - it’s only the water that has been uploaded onto the aircraft, apparently.

In June 2009, Jenna Thomas was strangled by nightclub bouncer Phillip Steven Packer after he refused to accept their relationship had broken down.  Now, the killer is being given day release on June 29 and Jenna\u0027s mum Kay Thomas, from North Cornelly near Bridgend, is furious, Wales Online reports.  She says she was only informed of the decision a week before by her victim liaison officer - and now fears she won\u0027t be able to stop it going ahead.  As far as I\u0027m concerned he should have lost his rights when he strangled my daughter, the 60-year-old said. A lot of my family\u0027s ashes are buried there [at the crematorium]. Can you imagine how angry I am? It\u0027s nine years on Sunday that he strangled her. I don\u0027t think he should have the right to come out. I\u0027ve got no rights at all. I\u0027m in pieces. How would any mother feel? Because he couldn\u0027t have her, nobody could have her. Kay has now appealed the decision. Jenna and Phillip had met at Apollo nightclub in Porthcawl, Bridgend, where Miss Thomas worked as a barmaid, and Packer as a doorman.  Packer’s marriage broke up and the couple moved into a flat on the Esplanade in the Welsh town, but their relationship deteriorated as Packer became more controlling. In May 2009 Miss Thomas moved back into her family home in North Cornelly, but Packer struggled to come to terms with the end of the relationship and bombarded her with text messages and telephone calls. Miss Thomas then met a new man, Ian Walters, who was the same age as her, and Packer soon confronted her about seeing him. On June 24, he offered to drive Miss Thomas to work, took her to a cafe for some breakfast and then drove her to a Stormy Down lay-by, where he killed her. He then drove her body to the town\u0027s police station. Nine years after the terrible incident, Kay is still struggling to come to terms with what happened.

Julie Banwell, 43, has spent the best part of a decade suffering debilitating pain, undergoing operations and taking up to 50 tablets a day. And the mother-of-three recently had her limb amputated, a move deemed by doctors the only option to end her crippling agony. Julie, of Newsome, near Huddersfield in West Yorks., stumbled on concrete steps as she took her then five-year-old son to school back in April 2010.  She had stitches in her knee but was diagnosed with the rare complex regional pain syndrome 18 months later. Julie, who works in education, said: I was an active mother and after a simple fall taking my little boy to school I haven’t been able to walk. There is no cure, just lots of treatments that do not help.  “I have been to every hospital across Yorkshire and had three knee operations, phyisotherapy, lidocaine infusions, acupuncture, steroid injections into the leg and even a spinal cord stimulator implant.  “I’ve had loads of blood clots and was having to take 50 tablets a day. I have had every painkiller you can think of.” But late last year, specialists at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary decided she must have the leg amputated.  Medics gave Julie only a 50/50 chance of the operation working but the surgery, carried out last week, appears to have been successful. I feel fantastic and I can’t thank everybody at the hospital enough for what they have done for me — they have been wonderful, Julie added. She is hoping the next step will be to have a prosthetic limb fitted. However, that too is beset with complications with Julie saying there is only a 50-50 chance of it happening. The mum continued: She added: “I’m very determined and would love to be able to walk again. I am just hoping that I can walk and have a life like other people.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sickening clip emerges teenage boys","story":"News\u0027Sickening\u0027 clip emerges of teenage boys abusing cancer-survivor gran — and they then share it on SnapchatDisgusted social media users demanded the youths \u0027have their mouths washed out\u0027 and they \u0027learn some respect\u0027 after the clip was shared widely online\u0026nbspShareByIan JohnsonBradley Jolly21:22, 24 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email This is the sickening moment a gran was abused by teenage yobs at a bus stop.

He added: She’s a lovely, quiet lady so where do kids get off these days by doing this?. “I was telling my partner today, once upon a time if a ball went into someone’s garden you would politely ask for it back. “But kids are going around swearing and doing this with no respect — they are a nightmare. “She was so proud to go back on the bus for the first time — she rang me and said ‘guess where I am’. “She was so pleased with herself, then she went out yesterday and this happened.”  “We will not let her out now because of this — she could have fallen over to get away and fractured her hip, and you don’t know what the consequences could have been. “But you just think of these kids, ‘how were you brought up?’.” Robin Armstrong, an actor and comedian from Tyne and Wear, was appalled to watch the 45-second clip and shared it with his fans. He said: “Abusing a nana is the ultimate no _ they are the heart of a family. “To hear her being called a dog and on the phone to her family, she’s worried — it is just sickening. “I was in total disbelief — I couldn’t believe the kids would do it. “I wish I was there to have sorted it. “As soon as I got the clip, I wanted to get it up there and find out who they are.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather britain hotter sahara","story":"NewsUK weather: Brits hit the beach for weekend heatwave ahead of \u0027hotter than Sahara\u0027 33C sizzlerA ‘Spanish blowtorch’ heatwave will send the mercury soaring to 33C in what forecaster are predicting could be the first of up to EIGHT heatwaves this summer\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHenry Vaughan06:48, 25 JUN 2018Updated07:18, 25 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritain will be hotter than the Sahara desert this week as the country sizzles in the first of up to EIGHT heatwaves predicted this summer. A 10-day ‘Spanish blowtorch’ heatwave will send the mercury soaring to 33C from Wednesday - making it potentially the hottest day of the year so far. Temperatures will begin to rise from Tuesday after an already baking weekend saw millions flock to beaches and beer gardens up and down the country. Scores of people were out enjoying the sunshine as they watched England beat Panama 6-1 in the World Cup - and it looks like it\u0027ll be hotting up even further as England makes its way to the knock-out stages.  After a “marvellous” Midsummer’s Day at 27C, the Met Office forecast 30C by Tuesday and up to 33C on Wednesday and Thursday. Up to eight summer roasts are now predicted ahead – with each spell reaching at least 28C, according to AccuWeather, the world’s second biggest commercial forecaster. Britain will be matching Nouakchott, Mauritania on the edge of the Sahara Desert, by the middle of the week, where temperaturesare set to be around 31C on Wednesday. The hottest day so far this year came in April when a temperature of 29.1C was recorded in London.  Met Office forecaster Sophie Yeomans said: We would expect at some point this week to beat that. We are going to continue with the dry and sunny weather for most places. Top temperatures are going to be on the rise. We could see temperatures into the low 30s some time this week, possibly from Tuesday, but more likely from Wednesday.

Drew McEwan was left stunned when Georgina Wilkinson, disguised as a gardener, showed up at his niece\u0027s christening. Georgina posed as a gardener as Drew and his family were taking photos at Loch Lomond in southern Scotland. After flying in that morning, she tagged him and ran away laughing - and then hopped on an eight-hour flight home that afternoon, the Daily Record reports.  Drew, Georgina and eight others have been playing the bizarre game since they all met by chance in China in 2014. Georgina had arranged to get one over on Drew with the help of his brother and sister and kept it under wraps until last Friday. And while the family photos were being taken after the christening, the photographer, who was also in on the joke, asked Drew if he could tell the gardener working away in the background to move because he was in the shot.  But Drew was left stunned when \u0027gardener\u0027 Georgina stood up, tagged him and then ran away. Digital consultant Drew, 31, tsaid: “My brother and sister had been planning it for months with Georgina behind my back. They even picked her up at the airport that morning. “I’ve never felt so betrayed by my own flesh and blood.”  Drew, originally from Newton Stewart in Dumfries and Galloway, added: “I didn’t even get a chance to talk to Georgina. You have to just tag and run, you can’t stay and chat. “I was in shock that she’d put so much effort into it. Flying over from America and back in one day is unbelievable. She had to make sure she was home in plenty of time for work on Monday. It’s my turn to tag one of the group now. “Obviously I’m not pleased with the bar Georgina’s raised for me but I must admit it was brilliantly executed.  “It was captured on video and you can see how surprised I was when I realised the gardener was actually Georgina. “When the video was posted on Facebook, it was unbelievable how many comments and messages we received. “To top Georgina’s tag, my one will need to be captured on video, I’ll need to have a great costume and it will need to involve international travel. I’m not telling a soul what I’m planning though. I’ll need to keep it as much as a surprise as Georgina did with me.”  Drew’s sister Angela enjoyed helping Georgina with the elaborate hoax. “It was the most fun to plan and I’m so glad we got to be part of this infamous game of international tag”, she said. Georgina thanked the Angela for “allowing me to ruin a cherished family occasion. In particular Angela for offering up her daughter’s baptism in the name of fun. She added: “Sorry Drewbs, you are now... it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy caught camera licking chicken","story":"NewsBoy caught on camera licking chicken advert on billboard as he waits outside restaurantHarvey Quesa thought the food was real and even tried to grab a piece\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBradley Jolly22:15, 24 JUN 2018Updated22:25, 24 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A hungry little boy tried to eat the food pictured on a fried chicken advert .

Zsa Zsa, a stout and barrel-chested nine-year-old dog, beat 13 other canines to the title and won her proud owner $1,500 (\u0026pound1,130) and a trophy. Celebrity judges in Petaluma, near San Francisco in California, were impressed with the mutt\u0027s wrinkled face, protruded teeth and shower of slubber. It was a very difficult decision. We loved all of the dogs, said reporter and judge Jo Ling Kent.  It was a huge responsibility, and we are just so happy for Zsa Zsa. The wacky contest, which this year was its 30th, said in a statement: Nine years young with a swaggering tongue, Zsa Zsa delivered a shower of slobber as she claimed this year\u0027s title. But she faced fierce competition from Charlie, dubbed Zombie Dog, for his sparse hair and spooky look.  Rascal Deux was vying to win the gong for the seventh time but his crazy eyes and hairless look wasn\u0027t enough. A beefy exercise intolerant bulldog named Meatloaf (aka Snorlax) and a terrier with dreadlocks also wowed the panel. Zsa Zsa, like most of the contenders, has had a tough life. She was rescued from a puppy farm, where she was bred for five years. She now lives with owner Megan Brainard in Minnesota.  The organisers say the contest isn\u0027t to mock the pets. Instead, they stress the idea is to celebrate the diversity of dogs across the world.

But hours after reaching the summit, the passionate mountaineer would find herself huddled in the foetal position, praying “death would come quickly”. She feared she would lose her life on the peak like so many others before her. Charlotte was made of sterner stuff than she thought, however, and after two days battling unimaginable conditions, she made it down the mountain. It was just one extraordinary day for a woman who spent her life travelling the world and scaling the world’s most beautiful, and dangerous, peaks. Tragically, she died last month after falling down steps outside her home, at the age of 61. By the time she took on the challenge of the world’s tallest mountain, Charlotte had already scaled all 53 of the 14,000ft peaks in western US state Colorado.  Her amazing survival story was immortalised in 2015 film Everest, starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Scott Fischer, a mountain guide, Keira Knightley, plus Amy Shindler as Charlotte. It was on May 10, 1996, now infamous in the mountaineering world, that Charlotte and 11 other climbers who had scaled the 29,029ft mountain were caught in a blizzard as they began their descent. The party were well aware that on Everest, rapidly changing weather isn’t just an inconvenience, it can be a death sentence. They found themselves caught in a whiteout, meaning it was impossible to tell which way they were going. Despite having rapidly depleting supplies of oxygen, used to help them breathe in the thin mountain air, the group had no option but to stop. The freezing winds caused Charlotte’s contact lenses to freeze on to her eyes. It was then, as the temperatures dropped to -50C and the winds roared at 70mph, that Charlotte curled up and waited for the end.  For two days the mountaineers battled to survive as snow battered them on the Southeast Ridge. Charlotte later recalled: “We waited for that warm fuzzy feeling that accompanied hypothermia and death.”  The storm eventually cleared, but eight of the men and women who had journeyed up the mountain would never come down again, including Fischer. It remains one of the worst disasters to happen on Everest. More than 375 people have died trying to climb it.  Writing in the American Alpine Journal, Charlotte described the relief that followed the storm’s passing. “Miraculously, the storm abated. Half-frozen we staggered to our feet and made an attempt to shuffle off. “My knees kept buckling and I couldn’t seem to make headway.” Just yards from the relative safety of her tent, Charlotte collapsed. It was Russian climber Anatoli Boukreev, who returned with an oxygen tank and dragged her back to camp, who saved her life. Later, people blamed the tragedy on the commercialisation of Everest. But for Charlotte, it was a dark episode during a life dedicated to mountaineering. During the summer before her ordeal she had tackled two other climbs in the Himalayas exceeding 26,300ft, Gasherbrum II and Cho Oyu. An only child born in North Carolina, Charlotte was a self-described “Southern belle” with a lifelong love of the outdoors and adventure. After graduating from university, she fell in love with the Rocky Mountains and made the state of Colorado her home. There, she became a talented waterskier and found a job in mountain rescue, living among the peaks that were her passion. She described herself as an “eternal fun hog”. Yet her disastrous descent from Everest was not the only time tragedy would strike in her life. In 1993 her boyfriend Mark Bebie was climbing in the Canadian Rockies when he died in an avalanche.  Heartbreak would strike again in 2004 when her husband of four years, Reese Martin III, died in a paragliding accident. But the loss of two loved ones did not leave Charlotte bitter. “I was never mad at Mark or Reese for dying in their pursuit of living,” she said. And despite multiple tragedies on the mountainside, Charlotte refused to give up her thrill-seeking. In the 22 years of her life which followed Everest, she scaled countless others but never returned to the mountain that almost took her life. But when asked to reflect on the tragedy which defined so much of her life, she said: “A bunch of people went climbing, each with his or her own reasons. There were no heroes or villains.” Her friends were distraught when on May 24 she was found dead at her home in Telluride, Colorado. She had celebrated her birthday just two weeks earlier. Charlotte died after falling down 77 hardwood steps outside her four-floor house. It had a lift but, despite sometimes being injured from her many climbs, she refused to use it as she wanted to stay fit on the stairs.

Casadi Schroeder, 33, needed 34 staples in her leg after the frightening attack in which an American black bear pinned her down on the forest floor. The mother-of-three was guest speaking at a Bethel Gospel Camp when she awoke to the bear attempting to claw through her cabin door on June 10. Casadi and her pastor husband Brad Schroeder, 33, scared the bear away but they feared the animal would attack a group of children sleeping in a tent near the food hall.  The couple did not have a phone signal while camping in Jeanette Lake in Meadow Lake Provincial Park, Saskatchewan, and were unable to raise the alarm. Keeping a safe distance from the bear, Casadi followed the animal to the food hall to warn campers and disturbed him attempting to climb into the building’s window. The stay-at-home mum, of Lanigan, Saskatchewan, Canada, said she didn’t fear the bear until it began to charge at her, pinning her down and digging its teeth into her leg. Watching his wife from the cabin window, Brad ran to her aid and began kicking and punching the bear as it gnawed on her legs. Casadi said: “There was no cell service and I felt really anxious. “I knew there were kids sleeping in a pop-up tent on the way to the camp’s kitchen and I thought if he was hungry they weren’t safe. “I told my husband that I didn’t feel good about it.  “I was keeping a good distance from the bear but I knew I had to warn people. There was no cell service at this camp so I couldn’t call anyone. “When I took the blind corner at the kitchen, I saw the bear looking in the window. “When he saw me, he stopped and turned around. “I wasn’t scared at that point I just thought he was curious and I knew bear attacks were uncommon. “In what felt like the blink of an eye he was right in front of me charging toward me and I started to panic. “I knew I needed to stay calm and not run, but back away slowly. “He started running at me really fast.  I felt his teeth sink into my leg. I was so shocked I began yelling at the top of my lungs. “He was biting me so deep, it felt like it was to the bone. “I thought I was going to die. I spoke to Jesus at that moment and said, ‘I am ready to go’. “I knew that if he went anywhere near my neck I was going to be dead. “The next thing I saw was this barefoot kick the bear right into his head. It was my husband.” Brad added: “In a situation like that you don’t even have time to think you just run. “I have little snippets of memory but all I wanted to do was get that bear off her.”  The bear released Casadi and she managed to run to the nearest cabin where its occupants pulled her inside to safety and alerted 911. In the meantime, Brad ran to their cabin to make sure the couple’s children Noah, eight, Mika, six, and Phin, two, were safely locked inside. The ambulance arrived at the remote camp an hour later and rushed Casadi to Meadow Lake Hospital where her wounded legs were stitched together with 34 staples. Casadi said: “The doctor told me my injuries were the best-case scenario. “If that bear had bitten me from the waist up I’d probably have life-threatening injuries. “I think it was God and Jesus who ensured that it wasn’t more serious and that the damage wasn’t life-threatening.” Conservation officers later trapped the black bear and put it down, fearing it was suffering from rabies and matching its DNA to a hair found on Casadi’s clothes. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Environment said: “Conservation officers trapped a black bear in the area Sunday afternoon that appeared to be similar to the one involved in the attack. “The bear was put down and sent to the University of Saskatchewan for a necropsy. DNA samples were also sent to the Alberta Fish and Wildlife lab in Edmonton for testing.” Those tests have confirmed that the bear captured and put down was the same bear involved in the attack.

The Sailugem bear had not been seen since the middle of the last century, with some experts even suggesting it was a mythical creature.  But these remarkable new pictures appear to prove the blond-coloured animal is alive and thriving in the Altai Mountains. It was found in a remote area, close to a point where the frontiers of Russia, Mongolia, China and Kazakhstan meet at an intersection.    Video: Previous cub sighting     Shocked tourists from Kaichi Travel spotted the bear while on a trip aimed at observing rare birds of prey and argali mountain sheep.  It was as if the visitors had seen a “ghost”, a representative said. For some years, scientists believed there was evidence of the white-clawed predator’s existence but not enough to prove in a scientific journal. In 2015, reports said experts had found dens and paw prints suggesting the bear was thriving many decades after it had been all but written off. The following year, images and video showed a cub - but dark in colour. At the time, a mother bear, presumably accompanying its offspring, was not seen by the \u0027camera trap\u0027 in the Saylyugem - or Sailugem - National Park.  However, new pictures from the tourist group - which organises tours for foreigners to far-flung Siberian destinations - appear to show for the first time an adult Sailugem bear closely resembling old artistic impressions of the wild animal.  The images, which were captured this month, resemble an artist\u0027s impression of the bear made in the Soviet era, The Siberian Times reports.  The best guess from scientists is that the unstudied beast is a rare subspecies of the brown bear, prolific further north. Russian zoologist Dr Genrikh Sobamsky spotted the bear in the middle of the last century and was later instrumental putting it in the Russian red book amid fears it was in peril. The new sighting resembles his artist\u0027s impression of the \u0027vanished\u0027 animal based on sightings in the last century.  “An absolutely incredible event took place in our June trip,” said a Kaichi Travel representative. “We met a wild bear, and not a common brown bear but almost a ghost – the Sailugem bear.” Tour guides from the travel company had ushered the party down a steep slope. The account continued: “When we arrived at a flat rock, we noticed the leg of a big fluffy animal some 60-70 metres below us (197 to 230 ft). “Soon it showed itself completely, and to our surprise, it was a real Sailugem bear, blond and very beautiful. “It walked around a bit and we were happy we could make some pictures… as evidence, just to show the world the Sailugem bear really exists.” The tourist group were “really excited and impressed at that moment” and knew they had seen something very special.

However his AK Party had been expected to secure a larger win as voters went to the polls, and opponents have yet to accept the result. As counting went on, his lead over rivals got narrower, but he is believed to have secured the 50% required to avoid a runoff. Erdogan was at 52.8%, with 95.1% of the votes counted, broadcasters said. His main rival, Muharrem Ince of the opposition Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP), had earlier urged election monitors to remain at polling stations to guard against possible fraud. The vote has ushered in a powerful new executive presidency, putting more power in Erdogan\u0027s hands. Critics say extending his powers will further erode democracy in Turkey, which is a NATO member state.  Turks narrowly backed the shake-up in a referendum last year. Earlier today, a crowd of Erdogan\u0027s supporters chanted his name as he emerged from a school after voting in Turkey\u0027s largest city Istanbul, shaking hands with people amid tight security. Turkey is staging a democratic revolution, he told reporters in the polling station.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.741936.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc humble claudio caniggia was even better off pitch barry smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee legend in his own right, Barry Smith captained the club for nine years before returning as manager in 2010.During that time he saw some of the best and some of the worst times in the history of the club.Among the best, however, was playing alongside some top-quality team-mates.And one name that stands out is Claudio Caniggia.Barry said: “I grew up watching guys like him play in World Cups, so I feel really fortunate to have played with Caniggia.“What made him stand out is, no matter how much he had done in the game before, he was so humble and had great humility.“What stood out for me is how he took time to help out the younger lads in training. Guys like Steven Milne and Graham Bayne owe a lot to him.“That was just the type of guy he is, very humble, no airs and graces and he took a lot of time with younger players that a lot of other players wouldn’t.“The first time he came in, he immediately made sure he was part of the team.“He didn’t just stand around, he got involved straight away.“Claudio didn’t want to be a superstar or anything, just wanted to be part of a team. His attitude was superb.“A lot of players could take a lesson from him. Every day he knew he still had to work hard.“I remember him as much off the park as on it because he was so good on the training ground.”Barry had another name he’d stick into the mix from his time at Dundee.“Georgi Nemsadze was the most technically gifted player I played with,” he added.“I knew when I won the ball, I could give it to him no problem.“I was very lucky to play alongside him.“I have to say, those guys did what they did because there were other guys in the team doing their jobs.“Guys like Lee Wilkie, Gavin Rae and me were the workhorses for the team and we allowed the players with all the flair to go and do their stuff.”As manager, Barry had to deal with some of the darkest times at Dens as the club headed into a second administration – the people at the club, however, managed to turn that time into one of the best at Dundee with the ‘Deefiant’ season.He added: “I do believe if the team hadn’t stayed up someone would have shut the doors at Dens.“Collectively everyone responded, the coaching staff, office staff, players and definitely the fans rallied around the club.“Though it was a really negative time, we turned it into a positive one which then led to promotion the following year.“I don’t like to single anybody out but Robert Douglas played a massive part.“It’s difficult to say just how much he helped gelling the players together.“All the players and their wives and families were invited round to his all the time and that really generated the team spirit.“He really made sure the team was a real team and that’s not even talking about what he did on the park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b7163e9578-397x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc jocky scott recalls winning league cup against celtic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn their 125 years, Dundee have five major trophies in their cabinet and, with almost 45 years since they last lifted silverware, it shows just how difficult it is to be top dog.Just like today, back in 1973, when the Dark Blues lifted their last trophy, managing to battle past the Old Firm was one of the biggest hurdles.Dundee legend Jocky Scott was part of the 1973 League Cup-winning side and says meeting Celtic in the final, rather than the semi, gave the side a completely different mindset going into the game at Hampden.Between 1969 and 1977, Dundee lost five Scottish Cup semi-finals to the Hoops. However, the one time they met them in a final they ran out 1-0 winners in December 1973.Jocky said: “The team that won the League Cup was a very good side.“Unfortunately, we couldn’t do more in the Scottish Cup because we kept meeting Celtic in the semi-final – we just couldn’t beat them.“When Rangers and Celtic are dominant, it’s very difficult. You’ve got to catch them on a bad day or get them in a final where you are on a hiding to nothing and just go out and play.“A semi-final is the worst game of all.“You’re within touching distance of the final but you’re not there yet.“Some players don’t handle that too well but then can handle a final.“Around 1973, we’d played Celtic in a few semi-finals and they were all very close games.“We were never really hammered in any of them but they just had that wee bit more experience of playing in semi-finals and winning them.“We had experience of losing semi-finals.“Psychologically that’s a big thing, whereas when you get to a final it’s different.“We were, obviously, the underdogs – with that there’s nothing to lose, just go out and play, do your best and hope it’s good enough.“You need wee breaks, too, and we got them.”In the midst of the miner’s strike, the 1973 final was an eerie affair with just 27,974 spectators braving the snowy conditions.Striker Gordon Wallace got the all-important goal late on to secure the trophy for the Dark Blues.Scott added: “Rab Wilson played it up to Gordon Wallace.“He had Pat McCluskey at his back but he took it down on his chest and in one movement hit it low into the corner.“The goalie was taken by surprise with the quickness Gordon hit it.“It was a typical striker’s goal, instinctive, didn’t think – bang.“We scored and went ahead – I don’t think we did that in any of the semi-finals we played, we were always having to fight back. We scored first and had something to build on.“It wasn’t like we scored and sat back and defended for 60 minutes or we were fortunate or anything.“We’d had a go at them, played well in defence and attack. It wasn’t a smash-and-grab win, we deserved it.“We were good enough to go on and win more trophies but, unfortunately, we didn’t. It was a good side with good players, individually and collectively.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715bb7ee0-788x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc the big days in dark blues history books","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most provincial clubs, for Dundee, trophies are a welcome bonus, not a given.In their 125-year history, the Dark Blues have lifted major domestic silverware on five occasions, though not since their League Cup win of 1973.Their first success came 17 years after the club was formed, in the shape of the 1910 Scottish Cup – the only time they’ve lifted the country’s most prestigious knockout trophy.In typical fashion, the one time Dundee did win it, it was the hard way.The first round saw them held by Beith, technically away from home but actually at Dens Park after the opposition surrendered home advantage, before winning the replay 1-0.A crowd of 20,000 then saw them take care of Falkirk at the first time of asking and it was the same with Motherwell in the third round.In the semi-finals they needed three games before beating Hibs by the only goal of the entire tie at Parkhead.That set up what was to be an epic final against Clyde, the side who would finish just above them in the First Division that season.Game one of an Ibrox triple header ended in a 2-2 draw on April 9 and, when the teams met again seven days later, there was no scoring.Dundee were finally able to kiss silver for the first time on April 20, 1910, when goals from Jimmy Bellamy and John ‘Sailor’ Hunter saw them edge out the Bully Wee by 2-1.That sparked off wild celebrations and although that second replay was a midweek game, the team were mobbed when they arrived back home by train late in the evening.Despite a few near things, it was to be 41 years before the fans were able to welcome another trophy to the city.That was when the side put together by director/manager George Anderson, and that was inspired by Scotland inside- forward Billy Steel, went all the way in the League Cup.Having edged out Hearts in the group stage, they beat Falkirk 2-1 over the two legs of the quarter-finals. A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2d0f7db5286-846x564.jpg ","title":"angela eternally grateful to off duty doctor and nurse who saved her life after collapsing in dundee park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA lifesaving defibrillator has been donated to Broughty Ferry YMCA – with help from a woman whose own life was saved by a mystery medical duo.Angela Cain, 45, was enjoying an outdoor keep fit class with her sister on Castle Green on August 26 last year when she suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and collapsed.Survival rates in Scotland for cardiac arrests are currently just one in 20.But luckily for Angela, a passing doctor and nurse rushed to her aid and immediately started performing CPR until paramedics arrived.She spent 11 nights in hospital and was finally diagnosed with arrythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy – a genetic heart condition which can be difficult to detect.Angela, who runs IC Fire and Security Limited with her husband Ian, said: “I was fitted with an ICD which is basically like my own wee defibrillator.

Never.“Every player has a responsibility, even those who don’t play much.“You can’t give all the responsibility to Messi, because then what’s the point of you being there?“Imagine if I’d thought in 1990 the world champions had to carry me through. No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2d0ee006656-836x564.jpg ","title":"bowmans new dundee united role is vital says boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tManager Csaba Laszlo is delighted Dundee United legend Dave Bowman has agreed to take on the new role of the club’s Scottish scout.It will see ‘Bow’ take on responsibility of identifying players already operating north of the border who could become signing targets for the Tangerines.And during the season he will be the man who makes sure Csaba knows exactly what to expect from future opposition.“I am very happy about Bow’s decision to be our scout. He will look for new players for us and he has experience in this direction, so I know he will recommend the right people,” said Csaba.“He will also look at opposition and this is vital for us. He is very close to the first team and it is an important position.“Paul Sturrock is doing a lot of work, but he will more or less be down in England and Bow will be here as our man on the ground.”Meanwhile, having signed nine players already this summer, the pace of the rebuilding is set to slow, though there will be more new arrivals in the coming weeks.For Csaba it is important that most of the players he wanted were secured in time for pre-season training getting under way on Thursday.“For the pre-season, more or less 90% of the team must be ready,” added Csaba.“You have to prepare the team, so it was important we had made these signings.“The majority of players we wished for and who we talked to are here.”United are still in the market for another central defender, while one more striker could be added to the squad in the coming weeks.That could see a number of trialists joining up for training and possibly even games, though Csaba has decided against arranging a closed-door game in which an entire line-up of players looking to earn a contract would be used.“Maybe there are one or two possibilities for that (trialists), but if you have to go on trial, for me, there is something wrong.“I am not against loan players but they must be one who can help the team and they have to have ambition.”Fans will get their first look at the new signings in a friendly at Brechin on Tuesday week.So far that’s the only pre-season game fixed up, but at least one more is likely to be confirmed soon.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"convincing players to come to dundee united has not been easy admits csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits getting the players he wants to rebuild Dundee United this summer has not been easy.But he’s revealed the more quality signings that have been made, the less difficult the process has become.With other clubs, often from top divisions, also keen on players like Callum Booth, Craig Curran and Frederic Frans, the Tangerines had to pull out the stops to persuade them to sign up at Tannadice.That saw Csaba making a point of speaking to every potential target individually, rather than doing business through their agents.“If we are in the Premiership it is easier to attract staff and players, but we are not,” he said.“I have talked to every single player we have signed to convince them to come to Dundee United.“It was not an agent calling them to tell them Dundee United were interested, it was the manager calling to say you are important.“I think this was a reason why we’ve got players. It’s a lot of work and it’s not finished.“Frans and Booth both had offers from Premiership clubs here, Frans also from the top division in Belgium.“They have come here and, when other players see that, it made it better for us to get others to come as well.”Csaba has also revealed not one of the new faces had a problem with the new 25-miles rule he’s introduced.From now on, every player will have to stay no further away from Tannadice than that and, contrary to what some predicted, it’s not been a problem.“Before it could be Willo Flood, myself and some directors travelling on the team bus, now every player will be together,” he added.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2d0faa48e14-e1529903786688-572x564.jpg ","title":"dog left blind after dundee vet operated on wrong eye","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA couple claim their dog has been left blind in one eye after a “botched” operation by a vet.Elizabeth McKelvie, 47, from Menzieshill, claims that her seven-year-old French bulldog Louis can no longer see out of his right eye following surgery which should have been carried out on his left eye.She said that she and her partner Scott Robertson, from Barry Downs, were horrified when he partially lost his sight following the procedure.Elizabeth said: “Louis had been receiving treatment from a vet at Wallace Veterinary Centre in Broughty Ferry for an ulcer in his left eye.

She is a spirit medium full time.From her studio, Sacred Spirit in Carnoustie, she is able to give messages from those who have passed away to those who were closest to them.Karen has been able to connect to the spirit world her whole life but only began developing the skill about seven years ago.She said: “I really began my development seven years ago when I travelled down south to meet with Tony Stockwell.“He noticed straight away that I had the ability to be a great medium so he became my first teacher.“I then became a guest on the Scottish dates of his tour.“People think that you can either talk to the spirit or you can’t – and while not everyone has the ability to, if you can connect with the spirit world you need to develop your skills and gain understanding of what they are communicating to you.“For instance if a spirit shows me a sandcastle I know that means someone has been married in a castle. However, you need to work at it to be able to gain that understanding.”Whilst Karen appreciates there is now a greater understanding and interest in mediumship, there are people who see it as a “circus act”.Mediums are especially in the spotlight now as it is portrayed on a bigger platform with TV programmes dedicated to the skill.“There is such a big interest in this kind of work that it has become incredibly accessible with people even going live on social media, but I feel that takes away the personal aspect of it.“I try to give very personal details to people so they know I am telling the truth and I am reputable.“I have even been featured in magazines who have done “psychic under the spotlight” tests and gave me full marks for accuracy.“I feel incredibly lucky that I am able to do this job. I get really emotional but you can’t not get emotional!“I have ladies who sit opposite me in a state of grief and I feel anyone who comes to my events or for a one-to-one session is hurting or grieving and I am able to help those people. I am doing this to bring comfort to people and to help heal them and that is really important to me.“I wouldn’t change my ability at all, I love it.”As well as providing spiritual readings Karen also teaches mediumship to those who have the ability.She said: “I can instantly tell if someone is a medium or has the ability to be, I don’t know why, it’s just a connection.“I travel the world teaching mediums and also have regular students here in the studio. About 80% of those students are here because I have picked up that they have the ability.“I also do online teaching, so if anyone believes they could have the ability to reach the spirit world they should get in contact to develop their skill further.”Karen will be on stage at the Whitehall Theatre on Wednesday June 27.Tickets are priced at £16 and can be purchased from the box office.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people pictures thousands gather at park for dundees race for life","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of fundraisers turned up at Camperdown Country Park for a very worthy cause.Race for Life saw women and men of all ages, mostly decked out in pink, as they took part in a 10k run to raise cash for Cancer Research.Running, walking, jogging and even sprinting, more than 2,000 participants took part in the race around the city’s largest public park.There was also a 5k option, with some participants completing the event while twirling 4lb hula hoops – also known as powerhoops – round their waists."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fff717cc5.jpg ","title":"dundee people residents celebrate after saving post office from closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHilltown residents were rejoicing after the community saved the local post office from closure.Following the retirement of the sub-postmistress in 1991, the Post Office announced the branch would be closed.The plans caused an uproar, with residents and councillors all pulling together to oppose the plan, which was finally shelved.Betty Hand, of the Ladywell off-licence, who was a customer of the branch, supplied bottles of bubbly for the celebratory party.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people rubbish effort a good example","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPupils  Barnhill Primary School in Dundee have taken part in a litter pick.Fifteen youngsters took part and collected rubbish from their school grounds and the surrounding area.Councillor Craig Duncan, who also joined in, said the pupils were enthusiastic and that three bags of rubbish – including plastic bottles, crisp packets, sweet wrappers and broken plant pots – were collected.Mr Duncan said: “The kids were cheerful and are all up for doing another one.

disappointment as the Dark Blues fell short of their target.A ninth-placed finish kept them in the division and, with a year’s experience as a manager under his belt, Nelms is backing Neil to succeed with “just a few more pieces of the puzzle” needed to push Dundee to the top table in Scotland’s top flight.The American added: “Once again he can build on last season and with just a few more pieces of the puzzle we have quite a good picture going forward.“With what we’re doing with players at the moment and getting ready for pre-season, it seems like the season ended a week ago and all of a

record straight after a suggestion not all his signings at Tannadice were put through medicals.Earlier this week current Tangerines boss Csaba Laszlo had stated that was the case and although he did not name McKinnon, he did mention the period during which his predecessor was in charge at the club.McKinnon, now in charge at United’s Championship rivals Morton, has responded by issuing a statement.“In light of reports in the press this week regarding the signing of players at Dundee United during my period as manager, I feel I have no option other than to clarify the following point,” it read.“I deal in facts only and the fact is that in my time as manager every single player signed was put through a medical by the medical staff at Dundee United.“I am disappointed that I have had to make this statement because although things did not work out the way I would have wished, I left the club on good terms.“I have moved on and my focus is on an exciting new challenge at Morton.”He would make no further comment and it’s understood he now considers the matter closed.United, meanwhile, were back at work on Thursday as pre-season training kicked off.Almost a full squad was on duty, with only goalie Deniz Mehmet unable to do any work following surgery.Midfielder Fraser Fyvie didn’t do any ball work but was able to put in some hard running as he continues his comeback from a knee

mystery buyer snaps up venue","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA mystery buyer has snapped up Dundee\u0026#8217s historic King’s Theatre – casting doubt over plans for its revival.The King’s Theatre Trust, the group aiming to restore the Cowgate venue to its former glory, has been informed that the building has been purchased by an unknown buyer, thought to be an investment firm.It is unclear what the new owner’s plans are for the crumbling theatre, with trust members awaiting further details.Talks had been ongoing between property agents CDLH and investors for several months.Trust convener Richard Meiklejohn said: “We had been trying to get access to the building again in order to arrange a feasibility study.“But that was put on hold because an offer had come in and the administrator was reviewing it.“Then we were advised that the building had been bought and there are new owners. We’re now waiting for more information to come out and review the next steps. We’ll have a board meeting to discuss that.”It was discovered in the 1990s that enough of the building’s original structure, including the ceiling, remained intact to allow the theatre to be restored.Dundonians have also been asked for their views on what they would like to see happen to the theatre – which once hosted acts such as Harry Lauder and Cliff Richard – should it reopen its doors.Former Lord Provost Bob Duncan is among the supporters of a revamped King’s and said restoring the theatre could change the lives of city kids.He said: “I am surprised that somebody made a bid for it because it was up for sale twice and didn’t attract a buyer.“We don’t know what they want to turn it into so there’s absolutely no point worrying about that until we know exactly what they are planning.“I don’t have any idea who has purchased it. It’s a case now where we’ll have to wait and see how the situation unfolds.“It’s a listed building so they won’t be able to pull it down.“That area of the city badly needs regeneration and hopefully they see that a theatre can be a huge part of that.”CDLH was contacted for comment but had not responded at the time of going to press.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Rat dropping Glasgow kebab shop that made people smell of fried food refused late licence","story":"                          By Alan Ferguson"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7961157.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Clydebank club wants to sell booze until 4am","story":"                          By Jack Thomson"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7965032.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"East Renfrewshire leather firm invests seven-figure sum as it looks to expand","story":"                          An EAST Renfrewshire leather and suede tannery has invested a seven-figure sum in machinery to boost output and meet growing demand."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7965865.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Former Celt Andreas Hinkel backs Marvin Compper to seize second chance","story":"                          Former Celtic defender Andreas Hinkel believed that Marvin Compper can still resurrect his Parkhead career."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7970094.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Watch the moment unsuspecting Glasgow shopper is proposed to -

Ewing, has now spoken out in support of the Transport (Scotland) Bill which is currently making its way through Holyrood, saying it promises \"radical measures\" to improve accessibility and prohibit obstructive parking.\"Inconsistent and obstructive parking is a nuisance in our communities and greatly impacts on our ability to easily get around by foot, and so it is critical we empower local authorities to tackle this important issue,\" he said.Today a coalition of disability and mobility organisations called on Highland Council to develop an Inverness Street Charter, setting out measures to improve accessibility.Produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in liaison with Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and Highland Cycle Campaign among others their \"manifesto\" \u0026ndash Putting Inverness Streets Ahead \u0026ndash identifies pavement parking along with other issues such as street clutter and shared spaces for vehicles and pedestrians as restricting safe access.RNIB campaigns manager Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"Elsewhere, after wheelchair user David Sansum, from Kinmylies, branded the parking situation in Inverness \"a nightmare\" in last week\u0027 HN others have taken to social media to share their own frustrations.On Facebook Paul Tuthill said: \"As a powerchair user I find this

claimed that in some instances, drivers were forced to park on pavements by the lack of any alternative.He said that it is often impossible to find a space and blamed Highland Council for not providing parking as part of new residential developments.Speaking about the situation in his own street he said: \"I may also add everyone parks on one side of the pavement, leaving the other side clear at all times.\"A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Regardless of whether parking provision is made for any property development this does not give motorists the right to park on pavements which, if causing an obstruction, is a reportable offence enforceable by Police Scotland.\"If waiting or loading restrictions are present these also cover the footpaths and are enforceable by the

National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality

clutter-free streets and logical street layouts would make getting around easier and more appealing.\"Highland Council introduced a new policy in April, requiring trade waste bins to be kept off city

The connection with the charity came about because Andrew is father-in-law to a friend of Emily Crossley, a former reporter and anchor for Channel 4 News and CNN International, who co-founded the charity in 2012 after her son Eli was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. (DMD)Emily has advocated for patients around the world and spoken many times in the Houses of Parliament.The trust raised \u0026pound3.5million in its first three years, and then six years ago started the annual Duchenne Dash, which with big sponsors such as Maserati, brings in millions for research and also raises awareness of the horrible disease. Last year\u0027 Dash raised \u0026pound1 million.DMD is an inherited genetic disorder passed on by the mother that leads to progressive muscle degeneration and weakness.

buildings","story":"\u0026nbspURGENT action is needed to prevent people from being injured or killed by debris falling from crumbling Inverness buildings, according to a former city provost.Councillor Jimmy Gray spoke out in support of Labour colleague and MSP David Stewart who is pressing for a new law compelling property owners to safely maintain their properties.Mr Stewart is contacting Highland Council chiefs to discuss his idea of regular surveys to gauge wear and tear, and to make owners carry out essential repairs.His proposal comes just a week after two people narrowly avoided being struck by falling debris in the city centre as Storm Hector hit.Earlier this year an apprentice stonemason also prevented another potential disaster when he spotted a masonry block hanging loose over Academy Street, apparently pulled loose by a banner attached to it.This week the Inverness Townscape Heritage project launched a new maintenance guide for owners of traditional properties, setting out key areas for them to consider, including the benefits of regular inspections.However Cllr Gray suggested a far tougher approach may be necessary.\"We cannot wait until there are serious injuries or deaths before stronger action is taken,\" he said.\"I\u0026rsquove been concerned for some time about the condition of buildings not only in Inverness but across Highland.\"We\u0026rsquove spent years trying to persuade owners of buildings to act responsibly. It hasn\u0026rsquot worked. We need to bring about a cultural change whereby owners take greater care and pride in their properties.\"I believe this will need to be supported by legislation which makes it compulsory for buildings to be checked regularly.\"He suggested surveys every three years, adding: \"We\u0026rsquove spent years in and around Inverness trying to persuade the owners of buildings to act responsibly and it hasn\u0026rsquot worked.\"\u0026nbspHighlands and Islands MSP Mr Stewart was successful in having legislation revised four years ago to allow local authorities to recoup money they spend on serving notices or for work carried out if a building is deemed dangerous.In January, kiltmakers Duncan Chisholm and Sons in Castle Street was served with a dangerous buildings notice by Highland Council and the local authority appointed contractors to make the building safe. It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs. But a crisis incident could not only injure people but affect their insurance and their reputation.\"A council spokeswoman said: \"We regularly remind building owners that the responsibility for ensuring the safety of members of the public in and around their buildings lies with them \u0026ndash whether commercial, retail, business, public or privately owned.\"The new maintenance guide can be

strong and committed football management and back room staff, and a hard-working group of good people across all departments.“I’m grateful to many people both within and out with the Club for their

long-term future to the Reds could begin before the start of the season.Scotland cap Shinnie’s contract expires next summer and Championship side Bristol City have reportedly been tracking Shinnie.The 26-year-old will be free to talk to any interested clubs from January 1 when the winter transfer window opens.Ideally McInnes wants to secure the future of his skipper long before then.He said: “Getting Graeme Shinnie on a new contract is something we would all want.“Graeme had a lot to deal with over the summer as he was away with Scotland and got married.“I am sure we will pick up on that (contract talks) over the next few weeks.”Signed from Inverness Caley Thistle on a two-year deal in 2015, Shinnie penned a contract extension in January 2017 until summer 2019.The midfielder-defender travelled to South America with Scotland at the end of the Premiership campaign and earned a debut cap in the 2-0 friendly loss to Peru.He started the next game, a 1-0 loss to Mexico, when Dons team-mate Scott McKenna was skipper.McInnes said: “It was a huge relief for Graeme to get that first international cap.”Skipper Shinnie was today returning to Pittodrie for pre-season training having been given an extra few days break.Aberdeen returned from summer on Friday but players involved on international duty with Scotland over the summer were given a few extra days off.Centre-back McKenna and Scotland Under-21 winger Scott Wright also reported back for duty.The Dons were today set to jet out to the Republic of Ireland for a week-long training camp in Cork.They will face Cobh Ramblers in a friendly on Saturday.Aberdeen’s three summer signings are in contention to make their debut in that friendly – midfielders Chris Forrester, Stephen Gleeson and Lewis Ferguson.McInnes is happy to let SPFL arbitration sort out the training compensation for 18-year-old Ferguson which will now go to a tribunal.Aberdeen and Ferguson’s former club Hamilton have failed to agree a compensation deal for the teen.It is understood the Dons offered more than £100,000 for Ferguson with Accies’ valuation believed to be around £900,000 for the midfielder who made 14 first-team starts for Hamilton last season.McInnes said: “We’ll go to the tribunal but I’m confident and comfortable that we’ve done our due diligence and the tribunal outcome will reflect that.“Hamilton have got such a high regard for Lewis so I’m not surprised it’s going to a tribunal.“Hamilton have produced some good players. I hope that can continue to be the case and that Lewis can reach a good level. He has settled in well.“I’m pleased we have a young player like that as we cannot always sign ready-made players at Aberdeen.“McInnes aims to have secured more new signings before the Dons face Burnley in the Europa League second qualifying round.Aberdeen host the English top flight Clarets in the first leg at Pittodrie on Thursday July 26 with the return a week

I don’t know why the teams couldn’t have been introduced next season so everyone knew.“That could have meant places went to the top three in the Highland League which would have been fine.“But we’re privileged to be invited and there is no point moaning about it, we just have to make sure we prepare for it as well as we can and try to progress past Inverurie.”The SPFL declined to comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

A booze reading revealed that he had 119 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The limit is 22. The 50-year-old was banned from the road for 24 months at Ayr Sheriff Court last week. He must also undergo community supervision for 18 months. Depute fiscal Jason Bell sought to forfeit the vehicle but Sheriff Leslie refused.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Borders to benefit from   1 3m energy efficiency funding","story":"BORDERERS are set to benefit from \u0026pound1,293,459 of funding to help make homes more energy efficient.\nScottish Borders Council has been given a share of \u0026pound49 million from the Home Energy Efficiency Programmes for Scotland (HEEPS): Area-Based Schemes.\nThe needs-based funding is given to councils to develop and deliver solutions \u0026ndash mainly solid wall insulation \u0026ndash in areas with high levels of fuel poverty.\nMinister for local government and housing, Kevin Stewart said: \u0026ldquoWe have made good progress and significant investment in tackling fuel poverty, supporting people across the country who need help.

old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people.

This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"United front to boost the Borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"  39 We  39 re so proud of him  39   parents of Galashiels scout with ADHD hope to inspire others to join group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

for no-deal Brexit","story":"Europe\u0026rsquos banking watchdog has warned that firms are unprepared for a no-deal Brexit and are dragging their heels on contingency plans despite a real risk that Britain will crash out of the EU without a transition period.\nThe European Banking Authority (EBA) published its concerns after finding that the progress of financial firms\u0026rsquo preparations for a no-deal Brexit were \u0026ldquoinadequate but should be be made \u0026ldquowithout further delay.\nWhile it welcomed a recent political agreement on a transition period was welcome, the EBA stressed it is not legally binding until a withdrawal agreement is formalised.\n\u0026ldquoThere remains a material possibility that, despite the best efforts of both sides to conclude a ratified withdrawal agreement, this may not be possible, in which case the UK would leave the EU on 30 March 2019 by operation of law without a transition period, the EBA said.\n\u0026ldquoThe necessary mitigating actions take time, and should be pursued without further delay.\nThe watchdog said it was aware that Brexit preparations would be costly, but said it was an \u0026ldquoinevitable consequence of leaving the EU.\n\u0026ldquoFinancial stability should not be put at risk because financial institutions are trying to avoid cost, it added.\nIt echos comments last week from from Joachim Wuermeling, a member of Germany\u0026rsquos central bank, who said supervisors were worried that some banks have eased up on efforts to secure EU licences ahead of the March 2019 Brexit deadline.\nThose licenses will allow them to do business across the single market through passporting rights which will no longer be available to UK-based firms after Brexit.\n\u0026ldquoFor those only submitting their application after the end of the current quarter, the chances of a timely completion of the licensing process decrease significantly, he said, according to a translation.\nA separate survey by EY claims that the political agreement on a transition period \u0026ldquohas not stemmed the steady stream of companies confirming their contingency plans despite the tentative transition period.\nHowever, the number is still relatively low, with around 34% \u0026ndash or 75 of 222 \u0026ndash companies monitored having confirmed plans to move some of their operations or staff from the UK to the EU, according to the EY Financial Services Brexit Tracker.\nIt marks a two percentage point increase since March, which followed a one percentage point rise the previous quarter.\nAbout 24% \u0026ndash or 53 firms\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash have confirmed at least one site where they will relocate staff in the EU, with Dublin and Frankfurt still the front-runners attracting 21 and 12 firms, respectively.\nThose who have publicly released estimates of the number of jobs they plan to relocate as a result of Brexit has also increased to 32 from 28 in the last quarter.\nSome of the biggest numbers have come from the likes of HSBC, which plans to move up to\u0026nbsp1,000 jobs to France, while JP Morgan is looking at relocating around 1,000 front and back office roles across a number of its EU sites.\nGoldman Sachs likewise plans to expand a number of continental offices, but will at least double its Frankfurt operations to 400 staff.\nOmar Ali, UK financial services Leader at EY, said: \u0026ldquoMost firms are yet to iron out all the finer details, but there is evidence to suggest they are continuing to make definitive decisions, with many recognising that the transition is not yet locked in, and may not be until very late in the day.\n\u0026ldquoWe are seeing more and more companies name multiple locations, unsurprisingly focused on those where they have existing operations or there is an existing financial services infrastructure to slot into.\n\u0026ldquoThis points to the fact that it is unlikely we\u0026rsquoll see one pre-eminent financial services hub emerge in Europe, and London will remain a leading global financial centre.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new

I accept your refusal to answer my question, and will not ask again.Your comments do, however, raise a \u0026#8216supplementary,\u0026#8217You say Scotland voted to stay in the EU. But it was not a Scottish referendum it was a UK one.Are you arguing that London, Newcastle and Bath should leave the UK too on the basis of the Brexit referendum?Do think, by analogy, that Donegal should be treated separately by Dublin, or even join Northern Ireland, since it voted against abortion reform in the recent Irish referendum, and appears to wish to have a regime in that respect similar to the one prevailing in the six counties?Or do you see nothing  politically relevant south of the Tweed or west of the Monachs?If so how, might I ask, do you square that with the terms of the Treaty of Union in 1707, which is the legal framework within which all this discussion should take place if it is to be held on the basis of respect for the rule of law?Those are in fact two questions.I’d be obliged of you could treat them separately: first, the \u0026#8216fragmentation\u0026#8217 issue and, secondly, the Treaty of Union issue.I am sorry to trouble you on a sunny weekend, but you yourself have, in the media, repeatedly emphasised the importance of these matters.Ian Mitchell.Reply from Mr Russell:Ian,Thanks – I have  said all I have time to say to you today.Consequently if  you are inquiring as a journalist, please contact my ministerial press office as this is essentially a governmental and ministerial query. I have copied in my ministerial private office.If you are inquiring as a constituent I would be happy to see you at my next surgery in Campbeltown but I cannot spend more time today on what appears to me to be a political attack , disguised as a question.Marie Claire in my office can fix up an appointment for Campbeltown which, given the usual pressures ,  will be of 15 minutes duration.For the sake of the record however I fully support the actions of my colleagues in the commons and don’t recognise your  rude and dismissive portrayal of them.No doubt you will now say that the SNP  will not answer your questions and make further references to our \u0026#8216Putinesque\u0026#8217 approach.I can only respond that no matter how much you wish to make yourself out to be a persecuted and neglected seeker after truth, the reality is somewhat different.In other words, good try but no cigar…….Michael Russell MSP.Reply from Mr Mitchell:Michael,Not one sentence of your reply even tries to answer my questions—which rather proves my point.I will not take up time at your surgery when you will, doubtless, have far more pressing business to deal with as this is, of course, not a constituency matter.If you wish to meet for an informal chat next time you are in town that would, as always, be a pleasure.On a procedural matter: do I understand you correctly to say that an ordinary member of the public like me – I am not a journalist – will not be answered if writing to a minister to ask actions taken in a ministerial capacity?If I am wrong, how do I address you on matters like this? Or how would I address a different minister who is not the  member for Campbeltownshire?Ian Mitchell.Ian,Of course you will be answered.Michael Russell MSP.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"volunteers sought to put vulnerable children first","story":"Who did you go to for advice when you did not want to talk to your parents?If you think you could be that inspirational adult in a vulnerable Campbeltown child\u0026#8217s life, a unique national mentoring scheme is appealing for your help.Children 1st, Scotland\u0026#8217s National Children\u0026#8217s Charity, is one of 13 organisations from across Scotland offering weekly mentoring to \u0026#8216looked after children\u0026#8217.This is part of the Scottish Government\u0026#8217s initiative \u0026#8216intandem\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 the first ever national mentoring scheme for this particularly vulnerable group.A \u0026#8216looked after child\u0026#8217 is described as one who lives at home but who legally requires intervention from the local authority to ensure their safety, well-being and protection from harm.Children 1st will provide the service across Argyll and Bute, beginning in Campbeltown this month.Maggie Farrell, mentor coordinator, said: \u0026#8216For many reasons, but often because of traumatic events in their parents\u0026#8217 lives, some children are not getting their physical, material or emotional needs met and many directly witness or live with the impact of addiction, domestic violence and serious mental illness.\u0026#8216A weekly mentor can offer a listening ear, a new perspective and fantastic opportunities to gain new skills and experiences which all help build children\u0026#8217s sense of independence and belonging.\u0026#8217Mentors in other areas in Scotland have said that they get as much from mentoring as the children do, with one commenting: \u0026#8216In only two to three hours a week, I can see the difference I am making.\u0026#8216It is very satisfying to see a child trying something new, having similar opportunities to their peers and beginning to grow in trust and confidence.\u0026#8217Another said: \u0026#8216We\u0026#8217ve all had role models in our lives if we think back.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees.

Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.

Doug Haig from the Bridge Centre said to do a world record attempt because it would be great for publicity and a lot of fun.  The group decided to make it an unofficial world record attempt because they were worried they would have to turn away people who were not dancing in time to the music. Instead, they can now welcome all-comers, with an instructional video already on the group\u0026rsquos Facebook page to get revellers in the mood."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7929938.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"North Berwick High School students taking play to the Highlands","story":"              MEMBERS of the Indelible Arts Youth Theatre are heading to the Highlands for the final of a national competition this weekend.  They are one of four one-act plays that will take part in the Scottish Community Drama\u0026rsquos National Youth Drama final in Plockton on Saturday.  The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment. In particular I am so glad that we have progressed with this play.  \"After a reading the script during one of our sessions the girls were behind it one hundred percent, here was a piece that they could relate to and completely identify with.\"  And some of the cast, pupils at North Berwick High School, are equally looking forward to taking part.  S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Calls to tackle Edinburgh Bypass gridlock as tram system to Musselburgh mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.  The other is an archer planned for the banks of the River Esk, with its installation expected to be next week. A trail of arrows around the town is also planned and will link in with a Global Treasure App, a treasure trail organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership."},{"url":null,"title":"Scotland  39 s first   39 reverse vending machine  39  is at Musselburgh Iceland","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS Iceland store has become the first supermarket in Scotland to introduce a reverse vending machine in a bid to end plastic pollution.  These machines reward people for recycling by providing money or vouchers in return for empty containers.  Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.  The six-month trials are designed to help the company better understand consumer perceptions and appetite for plastics-recycling technology across the UK.  They come ahead of the expected launch of a national deposit return scheme to which the Scottish, UK and Welsh Governments have all announced their commitment in principle.  The trials will help Iceland to provide government and industry with insights that might support the creation of a national scheme.  Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham MSP said: \u0026ldquoThis reverse vending machine will provide valuable evidence on how to help reduce single-use plastic waste and encourage customers to change their own behaviour as we look to end Scotland\u0026rsquos throwaway culture.  \u0026ldquoI would urge all manufactures and retailers to follow Iceland\u0026rsquos example and consider what action they can take to reduce the use of single-use plastics.  \u0026ldquoIn the coming months the Scottish Government will be consulting on a new deposit return scheme for drinks containers that will be one step to increase recycling rates right across Scotland.  \u0026ldquoAs part of our action to reduce the blight of waste littering our communities and polluting our seas we are also consulting on proposals to ban the manufacture and sale of plastic-stemmed cotton buds and have appointed an expert panel to consider what further steps can be taken on items like plastic straws and disposable cups."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959630.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Future of the Hollies Day Centre safeguarded","story":"              THE future of the Hollies Day Centre at its present location in Musselburgh has been safeguarded.  It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Phonebox removed from centre of Haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

Colin Beattie\u0027s comments follows a \"positive meeting\" with health bosses in the wake of patients\u0027 concerns about the service at the enlarged practice in the Musselburgh Primary Care Centre.  The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7067548.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"ASBO bans Musselburgh man from shouting and swearing at neighbours","story":"              AN ORDER banning a Musselburgh man from shouting and swearing at neighbours has been granted by Edinburgh Sheriff Court.

The European Banking Authority (EBA) published its concerns after finding that the progress of financial firms\u0026rsquo preparations for a no-deal Brexit were \u0026ldquoinadequate but should be be made \u0026ldquowithout further delay.  While it welcomed a recent political agreement on a transition period was welcome, the EBA stressed it is not legally binding until a withdrawal agreement is formalised.  \u0026ldquoThere remains a material possibility that, despite the best efforts of both sides to conclude a ratified withdrawal agreement, this may not be possible, in which case the UK would leave the EU on 30 March 2019 by operation of law without a transition period, the EBA said.  \u0026ldquoThe necessary mitigating actions take time, and should be pursued without further delay.  The watchdog said it was aware that Brexit preparations would be costly, but said it was an \u0026ldquoinevitable consequence of leaving the EU.  \u0026ldquoFinancial stability should not be put at risk because financial institutions are trying to avoid cost, it added.  It echos comments last week from from Joachim Wuermeling, a member of Germany\u0026rsquos central bank, who said supervisors were worried that some banks have eased up on efforts to secure EU licences ahead of the March 2019 Brexit deadline.  Those licenses will allow them to do business across the single market through passporting rights which will no longer be available to UK-based firms after Brexit.  \u0026ldquoFor those only submitting their application after the end of the current quarter, the chances of a timely completion of the licensing process decrease significantly, he said, according to a translation.  A separate survey by EY claims that the political agreement on a transition period \u0026ldquohas not stemmed the steady stream of companies confirming their contingency plans despite the tentative transition period.  However, the number is still relatively low, with around 34% \u0026ndash or 75 of 222 \u0026ndash companies monitored having confirmed plans to move some of their operations or staff from the UK to the EU, according to the EY Financial Services Brexit Tracker.  It marks a two percentage point increase since March, which followed a one percentage point rise the previous quarter.  About 24% \u0026ndash or 53 firms\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash have confirmed at least one site where they will relocate staff in the EU, with Dublin and Frankfurt still the front-runners attracting 21 and 12 firms, respectively.  Those who have publicly released estimates of the number of jobs they plan to relocate as a result of Brexit has also increased to 32 from 28 in the last quarter.  Some of the biggest numbers have come from the likes of HSBC, which plans to move up to\u0026nbsp1,000 jobs to France, while JP Morgan is looking at relocating around 1,000 front and back office roles across a number of its EU sites.  Goldman Sachs likewise plans to expand a number of continental offices, but will at least double its Frankfurt operations to 400 staff.  Omar Ali, UK financial services Leader at EY, said: \u0026ldquoMost firms are yet to iron out all the finer details, but there is evidence to suggest they are continuing to make definitive decisions, with many recognising that the transition is not yet locked in, and may not be until very late in the day.  \u0026ldquoWe are seeing more and more companies name multiple locations, unsurprisingly focused on those where they have existing operations or there is an existing financial services infrastructure to slot into.  \u0026ldquoThis points to the fact that it is unlikely we\u0026rsquoll see one pre-eminent financial services hub emerge in Europe, and London will remain a leading global financial centre."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7971463.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Erdogan set to assume sweeping powers after landmark Turkish election win","story":"              Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for the past 15 years, is set to extend his rule and take on sweeping new powers after winning landmark presidential and parliamentary elections.  Turkey\u0026rsquos High Electoral Board declared Mr Erdogan, 64, the winner of Sunday\u0026rsquos polls, which usher in a new executive presidential system which was approved in a referendum last year.  Under the system, the office of the prime minister is eliminated and executive powers are transferred to the president, who can rule with only limited checks and balances.  The Turkish leader, who is accused by critics of adopting increasingly authoritarian tactics but is loved by supporters for bringing prosperity and stability, may be facing rough times ahead, however. Analysts are predicting an economic downturn amid rising inflation and a struggling currency.  His win could deepen Turkey\u0026rsquos rift with Western allies, who are already concerned by setbacks in democracy and human rights as well as Turkey\u0026rsquos closer ties with Russia.  However, Turkey\u0026rsquos currency, the lira, rallied on Monday over Mr Erdogan\u0026rsquos victory, which allows the country to avoid instability in the short-term.  In his victory speech, Mr Erdogan said he would work towards achieving his goal of making Turkey one of the world\u0026rsquos top 10 economies by 2023, when the Turkish Republic marks its centenary.  He also pledged a more \u0026ldquodetermined fight against outlawed Kurdish rebels and alleged members of a movement led by US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom he accuses of orchestrating a 2016 failed coup against his government. Mr Gulen denies any involvement.  \u0026ldquoTurkey made its choice in favour of a more determined fight against the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) and (Gulenists), Mr Erdogan said.  \u0026ldquoWe will go after terror organisations with stronger determination.  Under the new system, Mr Erdogan will appoint ministers, vice presidents and high-level bureaucrats, issue decrees, prepare the budget and decide on security policies.  According to unofficial results that have yet to be confirmed by the electoral board, Mr Erdogan garnered 52.5% of the votes, while his ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, won 42.5% in the parliamentary vote. Mr Erdogan\u0026rsquos closest contender, Muharrem Ince of the main opposition Republican People\u0026rsquos Party, won 30.7%.  Mr Erdogan\u0026rsquos AKP fell short of a parliamentary majority but a better-than-expected performance by its nationalist ally should allow the party to control the 600-seat legislature.  Mr Ince, who complained of unfair elections, accepted Mr Erdogan\u0026rsquos victory during a news conference on Monday.  He told reporters: \u0026ldquoThere are no significant differences between our records and the Supreme Election Council\u0026rsquos records. I accept the results of the elections.  The politician, who led a robust campaign against Mr Erdogan, called on him to end his divisive policies.  \u0026ldquoBe the president of 81 million (Turks), embrace everyone, he said. \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos what I would have done if I had won.  The 54-year-old politician criticised Turkey\u0026rsquos new system, saying: \u0026ldquoTurkey has cut off its ties with democratic values\u0026hellip (Turkey) has transitioned to a one-man regime in the fullest sense.  The pro-Kurdish People\u0026rsquos Democratic Party, whose presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas was forced to campaign from inside prison, received the more than the 10% of votes required to win seats in parliament, spilling thousands of its supporters into the streets in celebration."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806594.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!

If agreed with the unions, and following a consultation with staff, employees earning up to \u0026pound80,000 will receive a minimum cumulative rise of 9%, with those earning more receiving a flat rate increase of \u0026pound1,600 a year.  The government said the proposals would mean that by 2020/21 NHS Scotland staff would be significantly better paid than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK.  Health Secretary Shona Robison said: \"Our NHS is built on the dedication and hard work of healthcare staff up and down the country.  \"They are our health service\u0027s beating heart, and I\u0027m proud to be offering them this significant pay rise in recognition for the work they do caring for the people of Scotland.  \"We were the first government in the UK to lift the pay cap, and today I can confirm we intend to deliver a pay rise of at least 9% to our hardworking NHS \u0027Agenda for Change\u0027 staff over the next three years.  \"We\u0027re doing all we can to recruit new talent and retain existing staff, ensuring NHS Scotland has the right skills and experience to meet future demand and rising expectations.

Jim Monaghan, who was the spokesman for the Defend Tommy Sheridan Campaign, will be paid around \u0026pound30,000 a year to help build a \u0026ldquosustainable coalition for \u0026ldquosocial change.  However, a senior party source blasted the move, saying: \u0026ldquoThis is an absolutely staggering decision that has stunned the party. Jim Monaghan is a wild conspiracy theorist who has defended convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan. Organisers are among the most vital party staff members, in charge of local campaigning operations and responsible for speaking directly to voters. This is like the SNP putting the cybernats in charge of door knocking. It\u0026rsquos utterly bewildering.  Labour advertised for seven organiser posts in February, three of which were to be based north of the border.  The job advert stated that successful applicants should have the ability to work with a \u0026ldquovariety of stakeholders and Monaghan landed one of the jobs. However, he has had strong ties to Sheridan, who is considered to be a toxic figure on the left.  The former Glasgow MSP, who used to lead the Scottish Socialist Party, won a \u0026pound200,000 defamation case against the now-defunct News of the World in 2006 amid claims he was an adulterer and swinger.  Conflicting evidence led to a police investigation and Sheridan was charged with perjury, after which a lengthy criminal trial took place in 2010. Monaghan was a defence witness in the trial.  A jury found Sheridan guilty of perjury, part of which explicitly related to a trip Sheridan and others made to a sex club in Manchester.  BBC footage on the day of Sheridan\u0026rsquos sentencing showed Monaghan clapping the former MSP as he walked to court. He had also previously carried out paid work for Sheridan\u0026rsquos then solicitor.  Monaghan was also a volunteer on the campaign to \u0026ldquodefend the politician and planned a book - A Parcel o\u0027 Rogues: The Tommy Sheridan Conspiracy - which he later abandoned.  He also acted as \u0026ldquonational press and media spokesperson for Solidarity - the party Sheridan helped form after quitting the SSP - before joining Labour in 2010.  Monaghan wrote at the time: \u0026ldquoObviously, there is a long and hard battle within Labour and it isn\u0026rsquot one that will even take place, never mind be decided, in the context of the current leadership election. I am confident that, for at least the next few years, it is best for me and for my community that I work within the Labour party.  In December, the Sunday Herald revealed that Monaghan was one of the warm up acts at a Labour event attended by UK and Scottish leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonard. He read poetry on the night.  Asked last year if he still believed Sheridan was the victim of a conspiracy, Monaghan said: \u0026ldquoYes, absolutely.  Monaghan\u0026rsquos Facebook page stated that he started a \u0026ldquonew job as a community organiser on June 18.  In 2016, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) - the official body that considers potential miscarriages of justice - declined to refer Sheridan\u0027s case to the High Court.  Sheridan pursued a judicial review of SCCRC decision, but it emerged last week that this latest legal bid had failed.

Campaigners say the ban on MSPs visiting the holding centre in South Lanarkshire should be lifted, but the Home Office says that visits are generally only for MPs due to immigration being a policy area that is reserved to Westminster.  However, Glasgow MSP Pauline McNeill has said that the rule should be scrapped and MSPs should be allowed to check on the welfare of detainees.  She said that all MSPs should be able to make an annual visit in light of concerns that have been raised over the conditions and treatment of inmates.  \u0026ldquoMSP\u0026rsquos must be allowed access to witness the conditions in which people being detained in this country are being held,\" she said.  \"I\u0026rsquom calling for Members of the Scottish Parliament to be granted access to the site on an annual basis.  \"Members of the Scottish Parliament must be able to satisfy themselves that the welfare and health needs of the people being detained are being attended to.  \"By visiting the centre members would be fulfilling the normal duties and rights of elected members in any democracy.\"  Critics of UK immigration policy have expressed concerns about the length of time asylum seekers are held at Dungavel.  Reports on Dungavel have shown that dozens of detainees have been held at the facility for months at a time, and in some instances, for over a year.  The Sunday Herald previously spoke to former detainees, who claimed vulnerable people were held in prison like conditions at the site.  McNeill said Scottish Secretary David Mundell should use his influence to get the Home Office to lift the ban.  She added: \u0026ldquoI have serious concerns not only about the way the site is being run, but also by the attitude the UK Government is taking in regards to this issue.  \"I myself had to write to David Mundell on a number of occasions before receiving a response.  \"I am calling on David Mundell to support me in seeking annual visits for Members of the Scottish Parliament.  \"It is not acceptable that the concerns of Members of the Scottish Parliament about the treatment of people from the communities we represent are being ignored.  Meanwhile, SNP MPs Stuart McDonald and Joanna Cherry are to be allowed to visit Dungavel after demanding access.  McDonald, the SNP\u0026rsquos spokesman on immigration, asylum and border control, and Cherry, the party\u0027s justice and home affairs spokeswoman, wrote to the Home Office asking for permission.  McDonald said a date had yet to be set for a visit.  However, he said MSPs should also be allowed to check on the welfare of detainees, as he backed McNeill\u0027s call.  He said: \"The Home Office has a pretty bad record on this. It (Dungavel) should be open to all.\"  In response, a Home Office spokesman said: \"Individuals or organisations who do not have a statutory right of access and who wish to view an immigration removal centre are required under the provisions of the detention centre rules 2001 to obtain the permission of the Secretary of State.  \u0026ldquoRequests to visit are carefully considered to preserve the privacy and dignity of the individuals detained and to avoid a disproportionate number of visits."},{"url":null,"title":"saudi-women-now-in-the-driving-seat-as-long-standing-ban-ends","story":"              Saudi women are in the driver\u0026rsquos seat for the first time in their country after the world\u0026rsquos last remaining ban on women driving was lifted.  It is a historic moment for women who have had to rely on their husbands, fathers, brothers and drivers to run basic errands, get to work, visit friends or even drop children off at school.  The ban had relegated women to the backseat, restricting when and how they move around.  But after midnight on Sunday, Saudi women finally joined women around the world in being able to get behind the wheel of a car and simply drive.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom speechless. I\u0026rsquom so excited it\u0026rsquos actually happening, said Hessah al-Ajaji, who drove her family\u0026rsquos Lexus down the capital Riyadh\u0026rsquos busy Tahlia Street after midnight.

As for the male drivers on the road, \u0026ldquothey were really supportive and cheering and smiling, she said.  In a few hours, she says she will drive herself to work for the first time in Saudi Arabia.  For nearly three decades, outspoken Saudi women and the men who supported them had called for women to have the right to drive.  They faced arrest for defying the ban as women in other Muslim countries drove freely.  In 1990, during the first driving campaign by activists, women who got behind the wheels of their cars in the capital, Riyadh, lost their jobs, faced severe stigmatisation and were barred from travel abroad for a year.

Ahead of allowing women to drive, the kingdom passed a law against sexual harassment with up to five years in prison for the most severe cases.  Criticism against women driving has largely been muted since since King Salman announced last year that they would be allowed to drive.  With state-backed support for the move, many Saudis now say they support the decision allowing women to drive and see it as long overdue.  Not all women are driving at once, though. The overwhelming majority of women in Saudi Arabia still do not have licences.  Many have not had a chance to take the gender-segregated driving courses that were first offered to women only three months ago.  There is also a waiting list of several months for the classes on offer in major cities."},{"url":null,"title":"polls-open-in-turkeys-high-stakes-presidential-election","story":"              Polls have opened for Turkey\u0026rsquos high-stakes presidential and parliamentary elections, which could consolidate President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u0026rsquos hold on power.

Nia Griffith stressed it was party policy to support the nuclear deterrent, adding uncertainty in the world meant this is not the time to be \"descaling\" it.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn voted against Trident renewal in July 2016.  The Commons vote saw MPs back the replacement of the existing submarine fleet carrying the missiles with four new Successor submarines.  Renewal of the submarines for the continuous-at-sea deterrent has been predicted to cost \u0026pound31 billion, with a \u0026pound10 billion contingency fund also set aside.  Ms Griffith told BBC One\u0027s The Andrew Marr Show: \"It\u0027s Labour Party policy that we keep Trident.  \"The decisions have been taken, the work is being undertaken and that is not a decision we\u0027re going back on.  \"So we\u0027re very, very clear - having a nuclear deterrent is a very important part of our defence policy.

Last month, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was understood to have written to Prime Minister Theresa May recommending that the UK increased its numbers to bolster efforts to counter the Taliban.  It was said between 400 to 450 soldiers could be sent to join the roughly 600 already deployed in non-combat roles following pressure from US President Donald Trump for international allies to do more.

Especially Danny Murphy awful job he did      Danny Murphy shouldn\u0026rsquot refer to England as \u0026ldquowe. A commentators job is provide an unbiased view of the game. I know exactly how irritating it is listening to biased commentary when you\u0026rsquore either neutral or supporting the other team #WorldCup      The worst part of England games is the biased commentary. It\u0026rsquos ridiculous. And Danny Murphy\u0026rsquos monotone voice is mind numbing!      Why does the BBC employ Danny Murphy he\u0026rsquos so biased I expect he walks lopsided.      \"There\u0027s nothing to fear for this side\" says Danny Murphy after games against Tunisia and Panama. Hello hubris, my old friend.      I know English people like Michael McIntyre and Nigel Farage, but surely even they can\u0027t find Danny Murphy interesting      Why does the BBC employ Danny Murphy he\u0026rsquos so biased I expect he walks lopsided.      Danny Murphy shut up, we this we that, BBC aren\u0027t biased are they.      Sorry but the English commentators are so biased man, You need to be as neutral as possible.....ridiculous man especially Danny Murphy      England are beating the Dog \u0026amp Duck yet Danny Murphy and his mate are still feeling the need to be shockingly biased with their commentary. Some of it is embarrassing.    Others came to the former Liverpool star\u0027s defence, arguing it would be normal for him to favour England.  Sam Plackett said: \"Why\u0026nbspis Danny Murphy being biased an issue? He\u0026rsquos an Englishman commentating on an England game for English TV for Christ\u0027s sake!\"  Steve Lynes added: \"I might not be Danny Murphy\u0027s biggest fan but I have no problem with him calling England \u0027we. He\u0027s English deal with it!\"      Why is Danny Murphy getting stick for referring to England as \u0027we\u0027 ?    Other countries commentators go crazy when they score.    I\u0027d also expect any ex Welsh player on co comms to refer to us as \u0027We\u0027 and go mental if we scored.  Some saw the funny side of the BBC analysis.      Danny Murphy just described Panama\u0026rsquos last couple of minutes as \u0026ldquotheir best passage, which is harsh on the canal.

The ancient mythical story of Deirdrie and Naoise is also one of the first documenting the shared destiny of the people of Scotland and Ireland.  Now a romantic landmark has been unveiled on the west coast of Scotland in honour of the legend, close to a spot where the couple were said to have found some tranquillity together.  The \u0026ldquoSheiling for Deirdre and Naoise was officially unveiled at a ceremony on Saturday, attended by Michael Russell MSP and Mark Hanniffy, the Consul General of Ireland to Scotland, along with more than 100 guests and local dignitaries.  The sheiling itself \u0026ndash a Gaelic word for a hut, or collection of huts, once common in wild and lonely places in the hills and mountains \u0026ndash is on the slopes of Beinn Ghlas, near Taynuilt, overlooking Loch Etive, Argyll.  It marks a personal love story as well as it was commissioned by Sam Macdonald, whose wife, Evelyn Day, died of cancer last year, six weeks after being diagnosed. Mr MacDonald, 76, said that when his 83-year-old Irish wife of 50 years was told she did not have long to live, she asked him to build a memorial to mark her favourite story, so famed in Irish mythology.  Mr Macdonald said: \u0026ldquoWe decided on the garden when we knew that time was running out. We came out of the consultants, and after we gathered ourselves together, we started working on some lasting memory.  The tale itself, which links Ireland with Scotland, was first featured in the Glenmasan Manuscript, which is held in the National Library in Edinburgh and has just celebrated its 780th anniversary.  Known as \u0026ldquoDeirdre of the Sorrows, legend has it that before she was born, the most famous woman in Irish mythology was prophesied to become so beautiful, kings and lords would wage war over her. Urged to kill her at birth, King Conchobar of Ulster decided to put her into seclusion until she was old enough for him to take as a wife.  But fate intervened and Deirdre met Naoise, a handsome warrior in the King\u0026rsquos court and the pair fell instantly in love, fleeing to Scotland where they lived a happy life alongside his brothers for a number of years, until word reached them that the King would allow them to return to Ulster. However, upon so doing, Naoise was killed and the distraught Deirdre went on to take her own life.  The President of Ireland, Michael Higgins, was unable to attend the ceremony at the weekend, but sent a message of support, which read: \u0026ldquoThe tragic tale of the two doomed lovers is one of the great tales of an Ruraiocht, the Ulster Cycle, a mythic arc that is the shared inheritance of the peoples of Scotland and Ireland.  \u0026ldquoThere is perhaps no place on our islands more representative of that shared inheritance than Argyll, once the home of the ancient Gaelic Kingdom of Dal Riada. It was there that Cu Chulainn, the warrior-hero of the Ulaid, was said to have learned the arts of war, and it was there that Deirdrie sought sanctuary with Naoise and his brothers Arden and Ainle.  \u0026ldquoI am so pleased that a magnificent memorial will now rest forever on Beinn Ghlas, not far from Gleann \u0026Egraveite, the place Deirdre and Naoise were said to have found a moment of peace. May it stand as a monument, not only to the common past of the peoples of Scotland and Ireland, but to the shared destiny of our two ancient countries.  The sheiling is on land once owned by Mr Macdonald, now taken over by onshore wind generation firm Ventient Energy. It features within it the statue of Deirdre and Naoise that was originally created by Glasgow School of Art graduate, Fiona McLeod, for Scotland\u0026rsquos National Gardening Show, held in Strathclyde Park in 1997. The golden statue had been in Mr Macdonald\u0026rsquos garden since the show closed.  Visually, the sheiling, situated near one of the turbines on the Ventient Energy wind farm, looks like it has been on the site for 1,000 years due to its historic features, looking across the stunning Scottish landscape to where Deirdre and Naoise were said to live in the 7th Century AD.  Scott Mackenzie, CEO of Ventient Energy, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted to support Sam Macdonald in creating the stunning \u0026lsquoSheiling for Deirdre and Naoise\u0026rsquo. Its creation is being celebrated by the entire community and is something that can be visited and enjoyed by locals and visitors from further afield, including Ireland.  Mr Macdonald said the stories preserved largely through oral tradition are from a time when \u0026ldquoan aristocratic warrior class dominated, \u0026ldquo characterised by dramatic stories of fighting and adventure on the part of the chiefs.  He said Deirdre\u0026rsquos powerful tale, with its \u0026ldquoelements of lust, treachery and ultimate death, is vividly told and that while one may question whether the characters in the story ever existed, recent research into place names in the North Lorn area of Argyll suggests they may well have done. The findings raised the idea that perhaps Deirdre, Naoise and his brothers Arden and Ainle were real and did indeed reside in Glen Etive, given the number of place names that memorialise them in the landscape.  In raising the Sheiling for Deirdre and her lover, Mr Macdonald said he hopes to revitalise the ancient myths and reinforce the strong social and cultural ties that link the people of the west Highlands with their Irish neighbours across the water.  He is hopeful it will draw visitors from around the world as well.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos going to be a very romantic spot, he said. \u0026ldquoIt will be lovely if someone proposes there \u0026ndash and there\u0026rsquos the possibility of weddings, as outdoor weddings are very much in vogue now."},{"url":null,"title":"laird-questions-snp-government-tactics-during-ulva-buyout","story":"              The former owner of Ulva has claimed he was \u0026ldquokept in the dark and \u0026ldquostonewalled during the community buyout of the island.  Criticising both the buyers and the Scottish Government, Laird Jamie Howard questioned the tactics involved and accused the SNP of \u0026ldquoignoring its elected duty.  The community buyout of the island, located north-west of Mull, was finalised last week as the Howard family relinquished their private ownership of the site after 70 years.  It came after the government prohibited Mr Howard from selling on the open market as a community interest had been lodged by the North West Mull Community Company.  The Howards eventually sold to the community company in a deal worth \u0026pound4.650million.  However, the family have now released a statement taking sweeping blows at those who aided the publicly funded \u0026ldquotakeover of Ulva.  The statement claims: \u0026ldquoThe strong indication is that the driving impulse for this acquisition has been, and is, not so much for the welfare of Ulva and its resident community but more to satisfy the long held personal ambitions of a few relatively local individuals on the island of Mull to benefit SNP party politics and prejudices, and to feed media headlines.  \u0026ldquoOn multiple occasions, during the course of the acquisition procedure, the legislative guidelines (as published by this Scottish Government) were cast aside, with key, mandated deadlines mendaciously ignored by Ministers and Scottish civil servants in order to coincide with keynote party speeches by the First Minister and to facilitate the acquisition of Ulva, regardless of the merits or otherwise, or the fiscal viability of the community plans.  \u0026ldquoIt entirely ignored its elected duty to be even-handed to all Scottish constituents.  The community deal was backed by an unprecedented Scottish Land Fund award of \u0026pound4.415million.  The shortfall was made up by fundraising and a \u0026pound500,000 donation from Australian company, the MacQuarie Group, which takes its name from Lachlan MacQuarie - the Scottish soldier who became the country\u0026rsquos founding father.  Criticising the buyers, the statement adds: \u0026ldquoAt every stage of the proceedings Jamie Howard was kept in the dark and stonewalled with no access or recourse to official information or assistance.  \u0026ldquoTheir dissemination of false and misleading information through the general media has been astonishing and disappointing.  \u0026ldquoWe hope the SNP party activists concerned treat the long-standing Ulva residents with respect despite their track record thus far.  The Howards also took a swing at Argyll SNP MSP Mike Russell, accusing him of \u0026ldquoindulging in ubiquitous and tedious SNP partisan sound bitesinstead of communicating with his constituents.  The statement went on: \u0026ldquoTime will tell if Ulva continues to be the rural, natural beauty that it is today.  An SNP spokesman said: \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos land is a valuable asset which should benefit the many. The SNP is committed to empowering communities through land reform \u0026ndash enabling them to determine their own futures.  \u0026ldquoUlva was once home to over 800 people, and now has only a handful. This is a story which is, sadly, all too common to many of our islands.  \u0026ldquoWe wish the local community the very best as they seek to regenerate and repopulate the island of Ulva.  The North West Mull Community Company declined to comment.  Mike Russell said he received no contact from the family at any point to discuss their concerns, but would have been happy to meet with them."},{"url":null,"title":"sun-shines-on-glasgows-mela-2018","story":"              Sun Shines on Glasgow\u0027s Mela at Kelvingrove park.

The mercury is expected to reach 27C in parts of Scotland beating Marbella, which is due to hit just 26C at the start of the week.  The temperature began to rise yesterday, meaning hot conditions for the estimated 5000 women who took part in Race for Life events across the country.  It comes amid water shortage warnings that have been issued with some parts of Scotland having seen just one third of the expected rainfall for June.  Scottish Water has asked customers in Stornoway to use water \u0026ldquowisely after a prolonged spell of dry weather in the area led to lower than normal loch levels.  In Moray, the dry weather has lead to concerns over water supply levels at Badentinan Water Treatment Works.  Forecasters are expecting highs of 27C in Glasgow tomorrow with the south of the country soaking up the best of the conditions.  The Met Office said Edinburgh will bathe in a 24C heat on Thursday, with Aberdeen and Dundee set for 21C and 20C. Some northern areas, such as parts of Orkney and the Shetland Isles are due to for rain.  Warm air from Africa is pushing towards the UK and temperatures will gradually move up from the low 20s in the coming days.  Met Office forecaster Bonnie Diamond said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos warming up for this week as high pressure drags up warmer air from the continent. Sunny and warm weather lasts until at least the end of next week.  Other parts of the UK, like southern England, are expected to hit highs of 32C.  Warm temperatures throughout May and June have been enjoyed north of the Border, but experts believe Scotland\u0026rsquos hottest day of the year will be beaten.  Dunstaffnage, Argyll, which reached 27C on May 28, was the highest recorded temperature for this year so far.  Met Office UK forecaster Sophie Yeomans said: \u0026ldquoWe are going to continue with the dry and sunny weather for most places. Top temperatures are going to be on the rise. We could see temperatures into the low 30s some time this week, possibly from Tuesday, but more likely from Wednesday.  Ms Yeomans added: \u0026ldquoThe pollen levels are going to be very high. right throughout the week., with grass pollen the main allergen there, so for hay fever sufferers it\u0026rsquos bad news."},{"url":null,"title":"charity-steps-up-debate-on-rewilding","story":"              They were once the great predators of Scotland - before their habitats were destroyed and they were hunted to extinction in the UK.  But now conservation groups are hoping to bring back the lynx and the wolf to Scotland as part of a controversial process known as rewilding.  Parts of the country have already experienced rewilding, with eagles, red squirrels and beavers already reintroduced, as well as trees and forests being protected and encouraged to grow.  However, calls are mounting to take things further and allow predators back on Scottish soil in a move conservationists claim will help to transform the country\u0026rsquos wildlife.  Steve Micklewright, chief executive of pro-rewilding charity Trees for Life, said: \u0026ldquoDespite its raw beauty, the Scottish landscape is today an ecological shadow of its former self.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot so long ago that vibrant, wild forest stretched across much of Scotland, with beavers and cranes at home in extensive wetlands and lynx and wild boar roaming in woodlands.  \u0026ldquoYet now our large carnivores are extinct, our woodlands reduced to small fragments, and a degraded landscape supporting little life stretches across millions of acres. But it doesn\u0026rsquot have to be this way.  The charity is about to publish a book which it hopes will spark debate about rewilding and offer a vision of how things could be for Scotland\u0026rsquos wildlife.  Scotland: A Rewilding Journey will look at the benefits and pitfalls of reintroducing predators - including addressing concerns over the potential threat to livestock.  Farmers have long opposed rewilding because of this issue, as well as concerns over replacing food production with wilderness.  However, Mr Micklewright believes farmers could look to other countries where wolves exist, such as Romania, for advice on how to protect livestock.  \u0026ldquoOur farmers are used to working in a landscape that doesn\u0026rsquot have these predators and so they don\u0026rsquot need to think about it, he said.  \u0026ldquoWolves were last seen in Scotland in the 1700s and lynx, in the late middle-ages, so they\u0026rsquove never had to deal with it.  \u0026ldquoBut in other countries, it means that farmers have to look after their animals differently. In Romania, for example, they use a big dog to scare the wolves off.  \u0026ldquoObviously farmers feel that they have the most to lose from rewilding, and no-one wants to risk anyone\u0026rsquos livelihood, so we need to look at how we address that and how we might compensate for that.  The charity boss claims that the book, which will be published in Autumn, is honest and addresses the potential pitfalls of rewilding, but also focuses on the opportunities for Scotland - particularly the tourism industry.  He said: \u0026ldquoPeople might think that rewilding means creating a wilderness where people don\u0026rsquot go, but that\u0026rsquos not the case.  \u0026ldquoWe believe we would have more people living in the Highlands if we did this, not less, and we\u0026rsquod have more jobs, not less, because people would want to see and experience it.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a big opportunity here for Scotland to become a world class environment that people want to come and visit.  Mr Micklewright believes the Highlands could become the Scottish equivalent of Yellowstone National Park in the US - where rewilding, despite some difficulties, has proven to be a success and regularly draws millions of visitors to the site each year.  Wolves were reintroduced to the park in 1995 and have been credited with increasing beaver populations and bringing back aspen trees and vegetation.  Trees for Life is already being recognised for the work it has done on Dundreggan estate in the Highlands, which was being overgrazed by deer and sheep.  The charity is reforesting the area and by 2058, expects to see red squirrels, beavers and wild boars return to the area.  However, Mr Micklewright claims reintroducing wolves in the Highlands is still a long way off.  \u0026ldquoWolves and lynx are already making a comeback in other parts of Europe, but - obviously - they can\u0026rsquot get to Scotland unless we decide to bring these animals back.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore a bit scared of that idea. When it comes to the bigger predators, that\u0026rsquos still a big, scary thing for a lot of people.  \u0026ldquoI doubt that wolves will be reintroduced in my lifetime, but I\u0026rsquom hopeful that the lynx is more of a possibility.  \u0026ldquoThe actual practicalities of reintroducing the animals is not the difficult part in all of this - it\u0026rsquos the social stuff, the conversations that need to be had, that\u0026rsquos the hard part.  \u0026ldquoWe need to start conversations with politicians, with farmers and landowners - we need to have a national debate about rewilding.  \u0026ldquoAnd hopefully the book will help to start that process.  Trees for Life has launched a crowdfunding appeal to help fund the publication of Scotland: A Rewilding Journey. Anyone interested in donating can do so at crowdfunder/rewilding."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-insists-it-has-an-open-ear-to-calls-for-a-second-brexit-referendum","story":"              THE SNP has said it has an \u0026ldquoopen ear to a potential second referendum on the UK\u0026rsquos membership of the European Union, while continuing to fall short of backing one outright.  Ian Blackford, the party\u0026rsquos Westminster leader, insisted its priority was making sure Scotland could stay in the single market and customs union, but added it was \"watching developments\" over the prospect of another EU vote.  He said a hard Brexit would signal a \"clear road map towards a second independence referendum that for me would be the priority\".  It comes as SNP Brexit minister Michael Russell said he was \u0026ldquoabsolutely not hostile to a second vote on any future deal, but suggested the result in Scotland would need to be respected.  He told the BBC: \u0026ldquoThere will have to be a vote at some stage. The question is what vote and when, and how it\u0026rsquos going to be achieved, and presently we don\u0026rsquot have answers to that.  Mr Blackford said the SNP was not \u0026ldquoin all circumstances diametrically opposed to a further referendum, adding: \u0026ldquoWe have an open ear to developments on that front, but for us it\u0027s the priority of staying in the single market and the customs union that\u0027s most important.\"  He argued that if the UK Government did not listen to the SNP\u0027s \"power grab\" concerns over its Brexit legislation, then an independence vote could follow and the Scottish Government had a mandate.  He said: \"What I\u0027m seeking to do is to defend the rights of the Scottish people and the powers that they have in their parliament, that is the immediate priority for us.  \"Of course I would make the point that if we cannot get the UK Government to listen on this then ultimately we will be having a discussion with the people of Scotland as to how we best protect our parliament, I would argue that independence is the best way of doing that.\"  He added: \"We\u0027re not at the moment talking about a timing of an independence referendum, what we have said is that we\u0027ll make a judgment on that once we\u0027ve got to the end of the Brexit process, so we\u0027ll concentrate on making sure we\u0027re standing up for our rights through the Brexit process.  \"We will have that debate with the people of Scotland and the economic future of Scotland, but we will only come back to a discussion on the timing of a referendum once we\u0027ve got through the Brexit process.\"  As Theresa May narrowly won another crunch vote on the Government\u0027s European Union (Withdrawal) Bill last week, Mr Blackford branded the Prime Minister \"very weak\", adding \"at some point that luck will run out\"."},{"url":null,"title":"alan-roden-brussels-has-accepted-brexit-but-it-remains-to-be-seen-if-britons-are-ready-to-accept-the-terms-of-departure","story":"              THIS Thursday in Brussels, all eyes will be on Belgium as they attempt to inflict defeat on a country which knows all too well about trudging away from the international stage.  But while fans gather in Place du Luxembourg to cheer on Les Diables Rouges against England, 27 European leaders will meet in a nearby building to ask why the UK can\u0026rsquot decide how to walk away from the EU.  Two years on from the Leave vote, they will gravely agree there has been a lack of progress. Then they will move on.  For while the Brexit soap opera continues to play out here in the UK, the attitude in Brussels is a collective shrug of the shoulders. Or \u0026lsquobof\u0026rsquo, en fran\u0026ccedilais.  Brexit is not even on the agenda for the main business being discussed at this week\u0026rsquos European Council meeting in the Belgian capital.  At the top of the to-do list is migration, and control of the EU\u0026rsquos external borders. Security and defence, tax evasion and avoidance, and how to regulate data across the continent will also come up - critical national issues only resolved with close international working relationships between neighbours.  Last week, I was in Brussels to witness what our European allies think about Brexit, two years since the vote.  In one sentence, it\u0026rsquos this: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore sorry you\u0026rsquore leaving, but get on with it.  The EU and its institutions have moved on, accepting the UK is on the way out and getting on with their work which affects citizens in 27 other countries.  In the European Parliament last week there was a hotly-contested internal debate about fertiliser \u0026ndash no doubt a headline writer\u0026rsquos dream for Britain\u0026rsquos Eurosceptic tabloids if they still employed Brussels-based journalists.  The debate centres on how much cadmium \u0026ndash a toxic-heavy metal \u0026ndash should be used in fertiliser, and the outcome will eventually affect every farm in the EU. It will also affect anyone wanting to import fertiliser from the EU after Brexit, but by then we\u0026rsquoll have no say over it.  There was a vote on copyright reform, which is designed to give publishers more control over how their content is used digitally. It\u0026rsquos gone too far and could remove links to the quality Press on social media sites, allowing \"fake news\" and the conspiracy theorist blogs that appeared during the indyref and EUref to prosper.  Tory, Labour and SNP MEPs from the UK are fighting it \u0026ndash but they lose their seat at the negotiating table next March.  For the people who work in Brussels and shape policy across Europe, Brexit is a decision made in the past while they look to the future.  One seasoned observer said the EU member states have never been more united on this \u0026ndash they are sticking together.  And they are sticking together because of the impact on Ireland. The warnings of a negative impact on the UK economy were made clear during the EUref, and ignored by voters, but the people of Ireland should not have to suffer as a result.  If Brussels is shrugging its shoulders when it comes to the UK, it is putting its arms around the shoulders of Ireland.  \u0026ldquoWe want to make it clear again and again that Ireland is not alone,\" Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in Dublin last week.  It\u0026rsquos not what Theresa May, David Davis or Liam Fox says that interests Europe, it\u0026rsquos what Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says. If he isn\u0026rsquot happy, the EU isn\u0026rsquot happy.  The UK Government can come up with as many inventive solutions to the border problem as it wants it will only happen if the Irish agree.  The \u0026lsquoBaileys test\u0026rsquo must be met: millions of gallons of milk travel unhindered across the border during the production of Irish cream liquor, and that must continue to be the case.  The solution, to everyone in Brussels at least, is obvious: the UK can remain in both the single market and a customs union. That\u0026rsquos achieved by being in the European Economic Area.  Earlier this month, Brussels\u0026rsquo chief negotiator Michel Barnier confirmed this model is possible to a Green MEP.  It would require some sort of renegotiation \u0026ndash the EEA agreement does not cover agriculture, which is vital to preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland.  But while tailoring for off-the-shelf options is possible new bespoke deals are not.  Labour\u0026rsquos suggestion that Britain can somehow negotiate single market access while also securing changes to the principle of freedom of movement is simply dismissed.  The Norway-style option of EEA membership is opposed by Jeremy Corbyn because it would make the UK a \"rule-taker\" not a rule-maker. The Eurocrats agree that UK influence would reduce in this scenario, but that\u0026rsquos not their problem.  The UK would become a \"lobbying nation\", holding joint parliamentary summits like Norway does in a desperate attempt to influence decisions.  But, despite that, most in Brussels still can\u0026rsquot understand why the UK would consider shunning this option when the only alternative \u0026ndash apart from reversing Brexit \u0026ndash is a \"no-deal\" scenario.  Airbus last week explained in stark terms what that means: one of the country\u0026rsquos largest companies which employs 14,000 people leaving the UK. If that threat to jobs isn\u0026rsquot enough to spur Labour into action, it\u0026rsquos hard to understand what will.  So it looks more and more likely that we are heading for a \"no-deal\" option.  Liam Fox has insisted that Theresa May is not bluffing when she threatens to walk way without a deal.  Nobody in Brussels thinks she\u0026rsquos bluffing anyway. They have laid out the options and have moved on while they wait for her to decide.  If this is what the Prime Minister presents to MPs this autumn, what happens next is a huge unknown.  Will Labour and Tory rebels join forces to defeat the government? Will Theresa May be forced to resign? Could a two-thirds parliamentary majority be assembled to trigger a General Election?  Or will, as the tens of thousands who marched in London on Saturday demanded, there be a \"people\u0026rsquos vote\" on whether to proceed with Brexit? One poll at the weekend suggested there is now a narrow majority for Remain.  Brussels may have accepted that Britain is leaving, but it remains to be seen if the people of Britain are ready to accept the terms of that departure."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie menswear firm toasts 100k whisky contract","story":"\t\tPernod Ricard, owners of several prestigious spirit brands, has awarded a \u0026#163100k retail contract to menswear outfitters Gibbs Inverurie.\t\t\t\tA contingent of 875 Chinese are heading across the globe for a 4-day whisky extravaganza in July.

It includes Italians, Turkish and Americans and they are putting on a wealth of hospitality to ensure that their guests enjoy their time here, which includes the chance to wear our Highland outfits.”                                                                                                         Highland Dress has become a major party of Gibbs business over the years.

Now, however, the cost of electricity to power festive lighting will continue to be covered by the local authority after a new approach was agreed by councillors.                                                    Members of the Infrastructure Services Committee (ISC) gave the go ahead to a new policy aimed at ensuring a reasonable, consistent and safe approach to requests from community groups.        Hanging baskets, banners and bunting are also covered by the new rules, as well as attachments to street lighting columns, such as signs.Councillors heard the use of festive lighting, bunting, banners and hanging baskets can help encourage commercial activity in towns, add seasonal colour and help promote community events.ISC previously considered proposals which would have seen community groups covering electricity costs for festive lights, hearing there was strong opposition to this from local councillors and groups.Members asked officers to revisit the plans, setting up a working group to further investigate the potential impacts of the proposals.                                                                                                        An engagement meeting was held with groups in April where a number of concerns were raised and consideration of these led to changes to the proposed policy. Electricity supplied through the public street lighting network will not be charged for and the council will now perform technical assessments on the suitability of lighting columns and advise community groups after it had been initially proposed that applicants would have to perform these safety tests themselves.Applications for festive lighting installations can now be submitted by October 1.There will be restrictions on installations outwith main footfall areas, but an arrangement to allow the use of festive lights featuring the branding of commercial organisations will be extended by a year.ISC chair, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “The cost of electricity for festive lighting in Aberdeenshire is around £11,000 and that seems a small price to pay for the goodwill of communities making the effort to brighten themselves up and appear welcoming at Christmas – we recognise a lot of organisation and effort goes into this already. The excellent work communities do is clearly of benefit to the whole of Aberdeenshire and the cost is one we can bear.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"pupils enjoy kidsout event","story":"\t\tLocal youngsters enjoyed a fun day participating in a wide range of activities when they attended a Rotary KidsOut Aberdeen event held a SRUC Craibstone Campus recently.\t\t\t\tTwelve pupils and eight teachers from Ellon Primary School, along with two Ellon Rotarian helpers attended.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

Few local high street businesses remain in Tain, Mr Stone\u0026rsquos home town.\u0026ldquoThe presence of these empty and increasingly derelict properties undermines one of the most important industries of the Highlands \u0026ndash namely tourism, he says.\u0026ldquoI would therefore suggest that properly tackling this problem should now be one of the most urgent issues for both the UK and Scottish governments.\u0026ldquoThis problem can no longer be ducked by plans that turn out to be more about words than actions \u0026ndash or, worse still, by means of the argument that the decline in the UK\u0026rsquos high street retail sector is inevitable.\u0026ldquoIf we really value our communities and their built heritage, then we must use every means at our disposal \u0026ndash grants, infrastructure investment, tax breaks, local and national planning \u0026ndash so that we can find new ways of bringing these buildings back into sustainable use.Speaking yesterday, Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt pains me greatly to see what is happening, and also to witness nothing better than fine words and hand-wringing when it comes to tackling the problem.\u0026ldquoThis letter is my first move in a campaign that I am going to pursue with the greatest vigour. Tain is my home town and I care about it \u0026ndash and the same is true of the other communities that I have the honour to represent.Monday 25 Jun 2018 11:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Sailor in distress proves false alarm","story":"A lifeboat rushed into action on Friday night after a yacht was\u0026nbspreported to be in trouble in the Pentland Firth.A boat was launched from Scrabster, but on nearing the 30-foot vessel\u0026nbspthe RNLI crew ascertained that the sailor \u0026ndash on his way home to Denmark\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash was not in any danger.\u0026ldquoHe was fine, but he\u0026rsquod been struggling with the tides to get through and that was all, said Andy Pearson, the station\u0027s full time mechanic.\u0026ldquoSomebody had obviously seen him dodging through the tides trying to make his way through the Firth, and he was using his experience to get through.Pearson said that the lifeboat stayed with the man \u0026ndash described as \u0026ldquoquite an old experienced sea dog \u0026ndash to make sure he negotiated the Skerries safely.\u0026ldquoSomeone filed a report with good intent and it\u0026rsquos good for us to go out and check that they are ok, he underlined.Thurso is the most northerly RNLI lifeboat station on mainland Scotland.Crews of the Scrabster station\u0026rsquos Severn class all-weather lifeboat have received 17 awards for gallantry.Pearson said that the man was not planning on stopping before sailing across the North Sea to Denmark \u0026ndash a distance of around 450 nautical miles.He stressed that any small vessel low in power should monitor what the tides are doing before they try and negotiate the Firth.\u0026nbspMonday 25 Jun 2018 11:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114264.jpg","title":"Special delivery for retiring Lybster postie","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe started in 1988, taking over from another postie who was a familiar figure to a certain generation, Donnie Bremner from Mid-Clyth.Thirty years ago Murray had to go over the Ord to Helmsdale to meet the train north to collect the mail then take it to the local sorting offices in Dunbeath and Lybster. All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster. After Hugh retired, Des and the late Mary Somerville took over before handing over to the present incumbent, Duncan Winfield, and wife Gail.One incident in particular has stayed with Murray and harks back to his early days on his rounds. When arriving at the late Annie Bain\u0026rsquos place on the Smerlie road he was implored to catch a ewe that had got loose.Murray jumped the fence and caught it as Annie almost simultaneously thrust her arm up its rear to pull out a new lamb and straight back in for another.After a quick wipe down of the livestock he was then asked if there was anything in the post, almost as if nothing had happened in the previous five minutes. Murray duly delivered Annie\u0026rsquos mail having firstly helped with the other delivery, and on to his next stop.A collection was taken in Lybster Post Office and the money was handed over by local postmaster Duncan Winfield accompanied by wife Gail in a small ceremony on June 6.Monday 25 Jun 2018 11:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Temporary reprieve for public toilets welcomed","story":"CLOSURE-threatened public toilets in Caithness and other parts of the Highlands have won a temporary reprieve.Highland Council has decided to put its plan on hold until a review of toilet provision in its area is carried out \u0026ndash but it will not be completed until October.In the meantime, the toilets threatened with closure will remain open.The local authority proposed closing 28 of the 96 public toilets in the Highlands while charging 50p for those that stay open. The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Monday 25 Jun 2018 11:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers.

The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
