He is grinning mischievously and clutching a beloved Jumelle box camera that had recently been given to him by his father. In the next few years, Jacques will constantly record the world around him, photographing his bedroom, making portraits of uncles and cousins, and framing his older brother, Zissou, as he leaps into the air from a boat.Another 60 years will pass, however, before the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York hosts the first exhibition of his work, belatedly bestowing on Jacques Henri Lartigue the recognition he deserves as one of the great innovators of 20th-century photography.When the celebrated American photographer Richard Avedon saw Jacques Henri Lartigue’s work for the first time on the eve of the MoMA show in 1963, he wrote to his compatriot to express his gratitude: “It was one of the most moving experiences of my life… You brought me into your world and isn’t that, after all, the purpose of art?”The world Lartigue created with his camera was a reflection of the one he was brought up in as a privileged, pampered boy in a family environment that was both bourgeois and carefree. His father Henri, a self-made businessman, insisted that neither Jacques nor Zissou attend school, instead recruiting private tutors whose main aim was to keep Henri’s offspring amused. He once said: “I have plenty of money. My children should learn how to spend it.”Later, Lartigue’s name would become synonymous with a certain kind of ritzy glamour and elegance, epitomised in his countless images of his lover, Renee Perle, whose sultry beauty captivated him. In the 1920s and early 1930s, he was known primarily as a society photographer, shooting the rich and beautiful in the resorts along the Côte d’Azur, where he felt effortlessly at home. The life he lived seems to have been as gilded as the lifestyles of the film stars, models, socialites and playboys he photographed.In her new book, The Boy and the Belle Époque, Louise Baring concentrates on Lartigue’s childhood and teenage years, the majority of the photographs included having been taken before he turned 18. She traces a formative journey that begins in the early 1900s, when the Lartigue family lived in opulence in Paris and their country retreat in the Auvergne, and continues until 1914, when the outbreak of the first world war signalled the end of the belle époque.Lartigue’s life during this period pertains to the arc of a classic French coming-of-age novel. He was an instinctively gifted, voraciously curious prodigy who found his creative medium as a child, and was sustained by it throughout his formative years and into his adult life.From the start, it seems, Lartigue had one eye on posterity, creating photo-albums and journals of the things he witnessed. Aged 11, he photographed his bedroom from ground level, furniture and a mirror looming over his toy racing cars.More often, as the array of model racing cars suggests, he was drawn to movement, and, as a child, often photographed relatives and servants jumping off walls and over tables to his instructions. In one memorable image, he captured his cousin Simone taking a tumble from a homemade scooter. His most intriguing early subject, however, was Zissou, a daredevil and a dandy, who built and raced his own go-karts, tearing around the grounds of Chateau de Rouzat, the family’s country retreat, in goggles and a tailored suit. Zissou was the eccentric action man, while Jacques, as Baring puts it, was “a sensitive child who became a lifelong spectator”.Later, he would photograph speeding racing cars in a blur of motion and beautiful socialite women framed like exotic creatures in closely cropped compositions. When these images were belatedly discovered and exhibited decades later, they attested to Lartigue’s instinctive embrace of what later became known as the snapshot aesthetic, a term loosely applied to 60s iconoclasts such as Garry Winogrand and Lee Friedlander, who disregarded the rules of formal composition. Back in the early 1900s, when Lartigue embraced blur and movement, his approach was so singular that it amounted to what Baring calls “a new visual language of the 20th century”.On 29 May 1910, Lartigue, then 15, began a new adventure in a new setting, arriving at the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne in Paris with an unwieldy folding plate camera. His aim was “to photograph the ladies in the most outrageous and beautiful hats”. Back then, the Bois de Boulogne in early summer was an open-air promenade, where society women paraded their style. They often crossed paths on the Allée des Acacias with the more bohemian and even more fashionable women of the Parisian demimonde: actors, dancers, musical hall stars and “grand cocottes” – courtesans like Liane de Pougy, a friend of the novelist Colette, and Émilienne d’Alençon, a great beauty who would later become Edward VII’s lover.Although cold-shouldered in public by respectable members of Parisian high society, these demimondaines, writes Baring, “set the style, deciding which couture creations would rise or fall in the coming season”. Lartigue captured them all, often startling his exotic subjects with the loud click of his camera’s shutter. The results are fascinating, a record of a time and place when this sartorial exhibitionism was simply another ersion in, as Colette scathingly put it, “the bustling lives of people with nothing to do”.At times, Lartigue inevitably comes across as a proto-paparazzo. More often, though, he captures vignettes that speak volumes about the elastic social mores of the belle époque. His snatched portraits, for all the period detail they capture, seem, like his previous images of speed and movement, oddly contemporary. The blur, the often fantastical silhouettes, the sideways glances, the way he crops his images so that his subjects loom large – and even more exotic looking – in the frame, point to a singular sensibility that was at odds with traditional composition.Throughout this period, his love of speed and movement remained. He photographed the early French pioneers of flight, Gabriel Voisin and Louis Blériot, as they risked life and limb in an aerodrome near Paris. At the 1912 Grand Prix in Dieppe, he made one of his most famous early photographs, freeze-framing the rear of a Delage racing car as it sped past him at close range. The driver clutches the wheel as observers on the other side of the track appear as leaning shadows, their blurred outlines evincing the sense of motion that Lartigue set out to capture. In retrospect, all those childhood days snapping Zissou on his go-karts and his cousins leaping through the air seem to lead to this defining moment.If Lartigue was a photographer of the age of speed and modernity, he was not a man of action when it came to the war, which, for the main part, seemed to pass him by as if happening elsewhere. As France ordered general mobilisation, he retreated with his family from Paris to the Auvergne and the sanctuary that was Chateau Rouzat.“The war inevitably made us unhappy,” he wrote in a secret diary, “but it was happy all the same… I played sports and we still amused ourselves.” There is a single image in the book that suggests the unfolding horror: a platoon of marching soldiers silhouetted against a grey sky as a spindly aeroplane flies overhead. The war inevitably curtailed his carefree life, writes Baring, but “Lartigue emerged intact, plunging into life with the passions of a child, refusing ever to grow up”. That childlike optimism would fuel his life and his photography for decades to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0814345af234de0659b1083e7836a90d04294451/0_1513_4253_2551/master/4253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8a5fabf6d550a6bfea908be1bf52ccf","title":"the big picture on the road in post ceaucescu romania","story":"An odyssey around remote parts of central and eastern Europe led Fabio Ponzio to this incongruous sightBefore the collapse of the Soviet Union, Italian photographer Fabio Ponzio would look at a map of Europe and find his eyes always drawn to the east, to its “mysterious names, inscrutable frontiers and roads that ran on into unknown, prohibited lands”. It seemed to him that the iron curtain was “the ision between the conscious and the unconscious mind of Europe”.He first travelled across that dreamlike frontier in 1987, two years before revolutions reunited the continent. After the wall came down, over the course of a couple of decades, he drove determinedly through all the remote territories from which he had been excluded, with a tent and a stove and a sleeping bag in the back of his car, along with three Nikon cameras and 100 rolls of film. He slept in woods or in the homes of people he met. Once, in the mountains of Albania, the villagers told him that he was the first foreigner they had seen since two Italian soldiers fleeing the armistice of 1943.His pictures from those years – of weddings and funerals, of drunks and pilgrims, the homeless of the cities and the rural poor – caught cultures in the hinterland after communism and before consumerism. That period, as the hope of liberation gave way to endemic uncertainty, is the subject of his book East of Nowhere. Ponzio’s camera was drawn to incongruity. He took this picture in Romania in 1997, eight years on from the fall of Ceaușescu. The international licence plates and the open road stretching out beyond the mountains might promise new freedoms, but the sheep in the back of the car root this image in a stranger, older more unstable kind of reality. The car is going nowhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf2ce07325e2f5101ee702bb163c23b4f846db96/0_321_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2012b105c687582b45d847c0c5437e6","title":"for one tide only modernist sandcastles in pictures","story":"Artist Calvin Seibert grew up on a ski resort strongly influenced by brutalist architecture in 1960s Colorado. “The construction sites were never fenced in, so they were great places to play and always had piles of sand,” he says.

The supply of oil is increasing. The result – as even those with only the scantiest understanding of economics knows – is that the price of oil must be falling.And some. The cost of Brent crude – one of the market benchmarks – fell to below $23 a barrel in early trading, the lowest it has been since the US and the UK were making preparations for the invasion of Iraq in November 2002.What’s happening to supply requires a bit more of an explanation, because with demand collapsing the normal response of the big producers would be to limit output in the hope that would stabilise the price.This time it is different. Saudi Arabia has responded by turning the taps full on even though its own government finances will suffer from a lower oil price. Why? Because the Saudis are in a power struggle with the world’s other two major producers – the US and Russia – and is convinced it can endure the pain of a low oil price for longer than they can.In this global game of chicken, Riyadh is gambling that it can eliminate competition from the US shale oil sector – much of which is unviable at $20 barrel – and force Moscow into accepting the need to get serious about production curbs. The Saudis ramped up the pressure at the weekend by making it clear that they were not close to a deal with the Russians.That announcement was the trigger for the latest price fall, and all the signs are that the cost of crude will go still lower. With Donald Trump accepting the need to keep tough Covid-19 restrictions in place until the end of April, it is clear that the crisis is going to last for longer than originally expected. It won’t be long before storage capacity runs out.The current weakness of oil prices will not last for ever. Supply will go down as a result of US shale producers going out of business and an eventual deal between Riyadh and Moscow. Demand will go up, in part stimulated by falling oil prices, which lower business costs and boost consumer spending power.But for the tide to turn one of two things need to happen. The Saudis need to stop flooding the market and consumers need to be able to spend their windfalls. Neither looks imminent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b04906bf889dbcc12b50f4403e237e0ad158fff/0_84_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cfc7be6c26db98b55193f8b7cba3f7b","title":"grounded easyjet faces further turbulence stelios negotiations","story":"Founder is embroiled in a row with the airline as he demands it ditches an order for 107 Airbus aircraftGrounding its entire fleet of planes was the easy bit for easyJet. Now comes the tricky task of negotiating in public with Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who, metaphorically speaking, is threatening to storm the cockpit and take hostages.At a simple level, Haji-Ioannou makes a fair point about the Airbus order being “the largest single threat to the solvency of the company”. Even cabin-fevered punters won’t necessarily come rushing back when lockdowns in Europe end. They may fear more viral outbreaks and stay at home to repair their bank balances. If so, adding new aircraft in an oversupplied market would be risky.EasyJet’s board, though, will surely realise as much. It will already be exploring the Airbus contract for ways to defer deliveries. Since all big aircraft orders tend to come with moveable dates, there will be room for flexibility.The problem, though, is that Haji-Ioannou isn’t asking for greater flexibility he wants outright cancellation and, over time, a smaller easyJet fleet. The gap in strategic expectations looks wide.Haji-Ioannou lost a fight in 2011 to ditch the then chairman in the last row about aircraft orders, so there is no guarantee he would win a rolling series of votes now. But there is a complicating factor this time: the possible need to recapitalise easyJet.Haji-Ioannou says he would support a rights issue – as he should given that his family has collected £620m in idends since 2011, including £60m this month – but he is vowing to make his backing dependent on an Airbus cancellation. Given the size of his shareholding, he has some clout.What should the chairman, John Barton, and chief executive, Johan Lundgren, do? Well, they should start by providing some much-needed clarity on easyJet’s financial position. Describing the current setup as “strong” is currently fair given that the company says it has £1.6bn of cash and $500m (£405m) of credit facilities. But what’s the rate of cash-burn? EasyJet hasn’t said, but the figure is critical.The other requirement is detail on any revision to the Airbus deal. If Barton and Lundgren can provide that, they would stand a decent chance of rallying other shareholders and facing down Haji-Ioannou. But they do need to get a move on. The first rule of rights issues is to go early.The most urgent problem in British banking, from the point of view of protecting the economy, is not the payment of £7.5bn of idends to shareholders over the next few weeks.Rather, it is the pace at which banks are processing loan applications and converting the government’s £330bn support package into hard cash in the hands of crisis-hit companies. Speed matters when trying to minimise failures and job losses.Frustrated borrowers’ complaints about delay and red tape have clearly rattled the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority, which is why the regulatory trio dispatched a “hurry up” letter to lenders last week.The idend question, then, is secondary. Yet a six-month ban on distributions to shareholders, copying the European Central Bank’s move last week, would still be the right thing to do – for two reasons.First, nobody knows how long the crisis will last. Preserving bank capital now would help to create confidence that the UK economy is capable of rebounding quickly with banks’ support after the lockdown. If the economic damage turns out to be slighter than feared, the current crop of announced idends could always be reinstated later.Second, it’s surely useful for policymakers to be seen to be whipping the banks firmly. The sector was bailed out in the last crisis, so needs to be seen publicly to be throwing everything at addressing the current one. If not, borrowers’ grumbles about foot-dragging lenders will become a running sub-plot.The first idend of this season is Barclays’ £1bn distribution, due to be paid on Friday. So, in practice, Threadneedle Street has about 24 hours to decide whether to allow it. Best to err on the side of caution and say no to all banks’ idends for a while."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5cc2378f70c1fad97809ab4853178acf20e7ca5/0_168_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01a61dd577fcccd7ec2cca249acc5139","title":"how can you feel safe amid coronavirus swap mindfulness for mindlessness","story":"It has long been suggested we should get in touch with our emotions – especially the most difficult ones. But right now, many of us just want to cocoonHealth and safety gone mad. Do you remember when that was the mantra of the fake libertarians who hated political correctness? You couldn’t do anything any more, according to them, because of the EU or the feminazis, the gays or the humourless lefties. The right didn’t self-isolate with their offensiveness, unfortunately it simply became mainstream.Now, health and safety has actually gone mad, for good reason, and it’s not really funny any more. They are drilling and banging in the house next door to me, busy with their home improvements. What a racket. I have found myself thinking about where so much amateur DIY ends up. A\u0026ampE. Should I glove up and push a gentle note through their door? Would that be the neighbourly thing?I understand, of course, that as our worlds become smaller, we focus more and more on our homes and on what makes us feel safe. It is this that gives us a feeling of control. This may be delusional, but it’s also comforting. All those silly books I reviewed last year on hygge and lagom, all the Marie Kondo-ing everyone was doing. All the Mrs Hinching now looks vaguely prescient what else to do but clean up? Why not huddle under a blanket and throw away stuff you never needed? Why not have a cinnamon roll as the world burns?Before the virus, the world felt uncertain anyway: Brexit, Donald Trump, the collective failure of the left, the rise of Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, India’s Narendra Modi. Never mind Russia and China and the bizarre president of Belarus, who has advised drinking vodka and visiting a sauna as ways to stay healthy in the current crisis. Get on your comfiest socks instead, make rye bread and declutter. No harm done.Now the world outside really is unsafe, everything changes. The demand for “safe space” will never chime in the same way as it once did. No one’s priority right now is being safe from opinions they don’t really like we all want to be safe from viral loads. Public space is dangerous – and eerie, empty urban vistas have never looked more beautiful.Private space is dangerous, too. Domestic violence is rising all over the world, the terrorising by men of women who feel less able to escape than ever. Home is a sanctuary for some and a prison for others, and home, the domestic sphere, the only permissible location for many women, is now the only place many of us can be.Sure, we are lucky to have homes – and our society’s sudden ability to shelter the homeless is obviously a good thing – but so many homes have no outside space and walls can quickly close in. “Home, with our bodies touching  Home, and the cameras watching  Home, will infect whatever you do  Where home, comes to life from out of the blue,” sang David Byrne, capturing the ambivalence about what home may mean.I hear this ambivalence all the time at the moment. I hear the people who are boasting that their homes are not in the centre of the epidemic, and I hear those who think that, after all of this, they want to move. I hear those nesting and baking and making themselves feel safe by dipping into a reservoir of happy childhood memories, covering themselves in gravity blankets of nostalgic pastimes, tethering themselves to happier memories.If you didn’t feel very safe as a child, this doesn’t really work, I find. What works best is a kind of numbing, not mindfulness but mindlessness. The shrinks can back off a bit for a while. Of course, it’s good to experience a whole range of emotions, rather than cutting ourselves off, but we can’t all be feeling all the emotions at the moment. For me, watching MasterChef is great because I have no emotional investment in any of the contestants and can just watch as they transform food in ways I would never dream of (good and bad).To get through this period I can feel part of myself shutting down. This has happened to me before, when my children have been in hospital and near death. It is a physical response to trauma and I find I can sleep when, normally, I would never be able to. I observe this in myself and others. The catastrophe has happened and the anxiety lessens. Life is not safe. The illusion that it ever was turns to ash.Friends with disabilities and chronic illness, these are the experts now. They know about being stuck at home and perhaps home, as James Baldwin said, is not a place but “simply an irrevocable condition”.The new condition that the virus requires is a level of disconnect. It depends on self-reliance as well as the need to reach others who are alone. The new condition is already disrupting chains of command. The government is infected and now sends out the medical experts to make its policy announcements, to do its dirty work. How small these big men of government now look. Dominic Cummings isn’t so Teflon, is he? Just one of the herd.The people who look big are the supermarket workers and the medics. That whole other realm of fake experts, the new-age gurus, the homeopaths, the Goop drips – all those grasping attendants of the “worried well” – have never looked so fraudulent. All that spiritual advice about living in the present, embracing the moment, the power of now? Yeah, well, the present is very difficult. The present is where we are and it’s unsafe.Knowing this is one thing, feeling it is another. The poet and novelist Rainer Maria Rilke knew about uncertainty. He told us to stop looking for answers and to learn to love the questions, “like locked rooms and like books written in a foreign language”. We don’t know what is going to happen. “At present you need to live the question.” That’s what is hard. Very hard.So as we weave our cocoons and wait to see what emerges, the only certainty is our gratitude to those who leave theirs to look after us all. That is enough for now. More than enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fe4ff06a2dedb62caa99e266f8bb975ec812502/1100_568_2907_1745/master/2907.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a525071b3812bfd8778d4dfc60db672","title":"lockdown socialising virtual hangout","story":"As the British people fire up their laptops for virtual hangouts, some obvious personality types have already emergedFrom this, though, we can clearly recognise personality types that barely existed three weeks ago. And everyone in the UK currently falls into one of these four camps:1 The Early AdopterI felt that everyone who got on to Zoom during the first week of isolation was perhaps taking it a bit too seriously. I did not need to see the faces of my friends, jagged by streaming bandwidths and the unflattering angles of laptop cameras, in the first week of lockdown. It had only been a few days since I’d seen them last. How often do you need to see your friends? Come on. Grow up.But those early Zoom adopters now look like lightning-foresighted pioneers of the brave new world, because the rest of us – only a few days behind the curve, but in a moment like this that may as well be years – are dragging ourselves on to a platform they are now kings of, while I’m still trying to find a spot in the flat that offers flattering lighting and an interesting-but-not-too-aesthetically-busy backdrop. Early adopters are out there offering kitchen cook-alongs and collaborative boardgame nights. I’m still trying to figure out how much of my body the laptop camera can see and whether or not I need to wear trousers.2 The Conscientious ObjectorThe refusal to use Zoom or video-calling platforms now comes with the same energy as that thing people used to do, in previous lifetimes, where they would declare in a slightly-too-loud voice that they “actually don’t own a TV”. Just like pretending to not know who Kim Kardashian is doesn’t make you a fascinating intellectual recluse, refusing to participate in the overriding communication method of the day isn’t in any way important or interesting.3 Confused By ButtonsIf you’ve ever had to demonstrate to an older family member how to play Scrabble on the iPad you will recognise in yourself the blunt terror of not quite knowing your way around the hip new app, the fear that comes with trying to navigate yourself out of one Houseparty room and into another without having to call your grandson for help. It’s a slippery downward slope from here, so the sooner you figure this one out, the better. That last sentence was almost solely for the benefit of me, I’ll admit that: I’m the old person who doesn’t know their way around the apps.4 Screenshot SnarkerQuite a snarky format of tweet doing the rounds at the moment is: “You know it’s possible to have a groupchat with your friends without screenshotting it for Instagram, right?” Which for me really undermines the rush people are getting out of embracing a new technology and feeling reinvigorated by human connection again. Did Alexander Graham Bell have to deal with this back when he invented the telephone? “We get it, mate, you can talk to people in other rooms. Oh but only if they own a telephone? A thing you made and manufactured? No thank you lol.” I feel like the people who are going to spend their pandemic berating others for enjoying things might have to wait a while for their nationwide round of applause, but we’ll see how long this lasts.I grew up fairly near to the Derbyshire village of Eyam, so every year or so we’d get a school assembly about Eyam and the noble sacrifices they made there in 1665. During the bubonic plague, the village chose to self-isolate, preventing the spread of the disease to nearby towns, yes, but also very much letting the majority of the population of the place die first (you might recognise this as our current government’s strategy circa mid-March 2020). To trade food and goods with other towns, so the assembly went, the population of Eyam left coins soaked in vinegar for passing traders to scoop up and leave medicine and bread behind in exchange. I can’t really remember what the moral of the story was, though. Don’t catch the plague?I’ve been thinking about Eyam a lot recently, because Derbyshire has become an unlikely locus point for erratic coronavirus behaviour, in a way that makes me warmly proud. This weekend, Derbyshire police had to break up a 25-person karaoke party, with the crime scene photograph showing a beige-and-pink buffet spread of various hams, egg mayonnaise and a plate featuring nothing but two pieces of fried chicken and three peach halves. In a time of pandemic it would be irresponsible of me to suggest that this is actually “extremely funny”, but … contracting coronavirus because you could not resist a meat platter and some pub car park speaker-level karaoke is both 1) extremely good and 2) an urge my own body has had to fight in recent weeks.Meanwhile Derbyshire police have been shaming walkers in the Peak District, publishing drone videos of ramblers as if they were murderers. “Despite posts yesterday highlighting issues of people still visiting the #PeakDistrict despite government guidance, the message is still not getting through,” Derbyshire police tweeted. I personally think this is relatively sinister and a massive waste of police time, but what do I know? There is some ancient magick in the Derbyshire soil that makes the people there act up in a plague situation.

If you have picked 2020 as the year to get hooked on cryptic crosswords, we are here for you.For beginners: I have been asked to collect in one place all of the friendly explainers we have done on how cryptic clues work – and here it is. stable has two puzzles that aim to let beginners win after a small and enjoyable struggle: the quiptic and Everyman.Next, allow me to show you around.We usually kick off with some topical clues from across the broadsheets, often wry observations about what is going on in the rest of the paper.We won’t be doing that today.Instead, hereare a couple of clues from recent themed puzzles. And for each, there is an explanation of both halves of the clue (cryptic clues offer, in either order, a definition of the answer and a little recipe for its letters).The setter Picaroon (whom we interviewed here) has a recent prize puzzle in the  – you can also peer at its annotated solution – which announced its theme in the entry down the middle:There you have a definition of GUEST BEERS and some wordplay to get you to the same phrase. And knowing that 10 of the other entries are also the names of beers is a little extra help. Picaroon is also a novelist – that won’t help with the solve, but it’s good to know.(Incidentally, the  – among, I suspect, other newspapers – is pausing the arguably non-essential business of sending out prizes for prize puzzles such as this one.)And here’s a clue from the Financial Times’ Gozo (whom we interview here):The wordplay is based on MESSI the entry is MESSIAH. That is not part of the theme if you print the puzzle out, you will see that all the across entries are examples of … something. I’ll leave it at that. Incidentally, Gozo is also the Spectator’s puzzle editor. Again, you don’t need to know that, but it’s nice to be able to picture these people as … actual people.Around these parts on a Monday, we next tend to find some entry or part of a clue that is an interesting or pleasing word. For example, here’s Qaos (whom we interviewed here) with a clue in the :… for the entry RAT. It’s no great mystery why an informer might be called a rat, but grass? First, there was “shop”, in the 16th-century sense of having someone imprisoned. Then a person who might cause that imprisonment to happen was a “shopper”. Next comes our old friend Cockney rhyming slang, changing “shopper” to “grasshopper”, finally shortened to “grass”.Now, this is not quite as interesting or pleasing as the story of “Lord and Master”, which, as we discovered, is rhyming slang for “plaster”, short for “plaster of Paris”, rhyming slang for “Aris”, short for “Aristotle”, rhyming slang for “bottle”, short for “bottle and glass”, rhyming slang for “arse”. But it’s nevertheless always pleasing to find Cockney slang unmoored and in disguise. “Syrup” for wig (“syrup of fig”), for example – or “loaf” for head (“loaf of bread”).And at this point, we turn our attention to our cluing competition. This time, we are looking for clues for another piece of unmoored Cockney slang. Apparently from “plinkety-plonk” for “vin blanc”, reader, how would you clue PLONK?Thanks for your clues for TORTILLA. Thank you also for the reasons as to why “tortilla” means so many different things. Beginners, feel free to skip this section otherwise know that we semi-seriously give out an audacity award for such clues as PeterMooreFuller’s “Cómo el señor Carroll cocinó Tortuga de Sevilla, frita con papas y huevos”.The runners-up this time are Dunnart, who hid the answer in “Means to keep beans – in refrigerator ’til later” and Alberyalbery, who uses initial letters in “From the front’s the only reason that I look like a bit of a dish” the winner is Phitonelly, who explains the working of “In the outskirts of Tijuana men work in the fields to provide the bread on the table”.Kludos to Phiton please leave entries for this fortnight’s competition, and your picks from the broadsheet cryptics, below.Add BRAN to DISH and you get BRANDISH from a neat little three-word clue.

The information was taken from Esri’s Living Atlas, one of the world’s largest collections of geographic information.By eliminating any vegetation or infrastructure, the maps show each river’s geomorphology as it would appear on bare ground. Elevation data can be valuable in highlighting river features and landforms that cannot be seen from normal satellite images, such as slight changes in elevation, run-off, levees, sediment deposits and how the land has changed over time.One common method in collecting elevation data of this kind is to use a laser scan known as lidar, which measures distance by firing a laser at the ground, most often from a plane, to create a highly detailed picture of the elevation of the earth. Satellite-based sensing is also used for capturing similar data across large areas. This technology is used in various industries including agriculture, conservation, water management and soil science.The elevation data begins life as a greyscale colour ramp, mapping each elevation value by colour intensity. Using its mapping software, ArcGIS Pro, Esri UK applied different colours to the maps, making historic river paths, small tributaries and other details which cannot easily be seen from satellite images more clearly visible.The main distributary of the Ganges. The map shows a braided river, with pink used to highlight its main path, showing the lowest elevations – generally equal to sea level. The greens have been used for higher elevations – generally to show land. The darker green shows lower elevations (around five metres above sea level) and fades to the lighter green, which shows higher elevations of around 13 metres (43ft) above sea level. The areas of pink to the right show lower-lying land.This image reveals the floodplains and pathways that the river has flowed along in the past. It also shows Lake Beulah (an oxbow lake, at the top of the map) and Lake Whittington (another oxbow lake, at the bottom) and the confluence where the Arkansas River meets the Mississippi. The blue colours highlight the path of the river, around 30 metres above sea level, with the deepest blue showing the areas of lowest elevation, and the deepest parts of the river. The greens generally highlight patterns on the land created by historic river paths, fading to a light green which signifies the highest elevation, up to around 60 metres above sea level.The darker colours in the braided river shows low elevation, around seven metres above sea level. The deep purple highlights the main path of the river and areas of low-lying land. The lighter colours (orange to yellow, with yellow being the highest) shows higher elevations of up to around 17 metres above sea level.This map shows the river delta, where islands of deposited sediment have formed in the middle of the main channel. The darker colours show low elevations, equal to sea level, and the lighter colours show higher elevations, of up to around 38 metres above sea level.This section of the river is in the process of becoming an oxbow lake. As the sediment builds up, it will become cut off from the main channel. The lighter colours show low elevations, equal to sea level and the darker colours show higher elevations of up to around 11 metres above sea level.The lighter colours in the image of this northern branch of the Mekong show low elevations, equal to sea level, and the darker colours show higher elevations of up to around 24 metres above sea level.The darker colours show low elevations, around 17 metres above sea level, and the lighter colours show higher elevations of up to around 45 metres above sea level.This shows the braided section of the river before it reaches the Meeting of Waters confluence, close to the city of Manaus, where the dark water of the Rio Negro meets the pale, sandy water of the Amazon. The blues are used to highlight the main river and tributary paths. The deep blue shows low elevations of up to 15 metres above sea level and the lighter blue shows areas of around 35 metres above sea level. The green (around 50 metres above sea level) and yellow (around 65 metres above sea level) highlight tributaries or channels.

Not everyone can ride out the crisis like themHow can I make self-isolation more glamorous?It is rather heartening that, even in the midst of a global catastrophe, humans can still find ways to turn the current situation into an aspirational statement. Luxury retailers now have canny “working from home essentials” on their websites, those “essentials” being £195 polo shirts and £145 tracksuit bottoms. “There is a switch in influencer content online,” a consultant told the FT last week, excitingly. Instead of travel and fashion being the focus, influencers are switching to cooking and fitness. So instead of feeling inferior for not having scored that sunset selfie in Bali, we can all feel bad for not having the right yoga mat. How about that for personal growth?And it’s not just professional influencers who are in on this game. For those who spend too long on social media, it is now ingrained to the point of instinct to let people know you are living life better than them. This might seem illogical, when we all know that everyone – from Mick Jagger to your mum – is sitting on the sofa watching Tiger King on Netflix. But this instinct is, I think, especially strong in times of stress and anxiety, when no one knows if they are doing the right thing. And you know a really great way to feel better about your situation? Make other people feel worse about theirs.Professional rich person David Geffen has long been my favourite person on Instagram, with his updates on which celebrity is currently his guest on his yacht, Rising Sun. But last weekend he took his Instagram game to a new level with the caption of a photo of Rising Sun: “Sunset last night … isolated in the Grenadines avoiding the virus. I’m hoping everybody is staying safe.” We seasoned Geffen watchers knew this was an unusually empathetic post from David, with its uncharacteristic concern for the little people. Alas, the Johnny-come-latelies did not get this and mocked Geffen for his less than inclusive post. He has now – tragically – deleted his account.And yet, Geffen is not the only one doing this. He is a billionaire, so his version of glamorous social distancing is billionaire-sized, but a quick, faintly nauseating glance through Instagram will show that he is far from alone in attempting to create Instagrammable isolation. Social media cliches already include photogenic children skipping on an empty beach in front of their parents’ Cornish second home, or going for bucolic walks near their parents’ second home in Dorset, or doing home schooling in front of the Aga in their parents’ second home in Norfolk. “Making the most of self-isolation! #takethatcoronavirus #blitzspirit” is a typical caption. Yes, we’re all in it together, but some people are just naturally gifted at doing it better (and have a second home, which is incidental, of course).Last Saturday, the Italian novelist Francesca Melandri wrote in the  about the relevance of class during self-isolation: “Being locked up in a house with a pretty garden or in an overcrowded housing project will not be the same.” This is patently true, but apparently not obvious to everyone. We are all confused about what to do, and I understand needing external validation for one’s choices. But perhaps some people could bear in mind that not everyone has those choices, and so chill on the social media smugness, just for now. Also, if you don’t want people to criticise your choices, don’t post about them on social media. “That boat in which you’ll be sailing in order to defeat the epidemic will not look the same to everyone nor is it actually the same for everyone: it never was,” Melandri wrote. Especially if that boat is a giant yacht.Email your questions to Hadley Freeman at ask.hadley@the This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

You can say that again, mate. At 900 pages, The Mirror and the Light has arrived eerily perfectly formed for the present we are reckoning with – and I don’t just mean that the hardback version is the perfect size for putting under your laptop to avoid double chin on Zoom calls. Cromwell is a master of optics and power dressing five centuries ahead of his time: he sees the visual messaging in every embroidered cloak and the symbolism in every jewellery love gift. Also, the square necklines are very this-season Rixo.Jess Cartner-MorleyEven if you have yet to surrender to a full day in sweatpants, life probably feels less than glamorous at the moment. What better world to get lost in, then, than one described by F Scott Fitzgerald. The Great Gatsby is the obvious choice, but if you pine after a cancelled holiday to, say, the south of France, the author’s last novel is a good way to get your Riviera fashion fix. From bathing suits and corsages to the notion of dressing for dinner, there is plenty of style inspiration to stockpile.Leah HarperIf you have ever felt sheepish about having an interest in style, I urge you to read this book. It argues that clothes are far from a trivial or superficial pursuit, through potted fashion history and reflection from luminaries such as Jane Austen and Nancy Mitford. Most memorable, though, are the stories of women in horrific circumstances who have used clothing as balm the image of a seamstress customising her fellow prisoners’ uniforms in Ravensbrück concentration camp during the second world war has stayed with me since I read it a decade ago. The book is a great read for where we’re at now – joyful, hopeful and free of judgment. It seems to say: whatever makes you feel better, whatever you enjoy when life is otherwise bewildering, you should absolutely go for it. Hannah MarriottLooking at the intergalactic fashions created by designer Larry LeGaspi is wonderfully escapist. Rick Owens, who curated this coffee table book after realising there was a LeGaspi-shaped hole in the internet, credits the designer as a big influence on his own otherworldly fashion aesthetic. Stage looks for Kiss, Labelle and Divine are just some of the treasures in this warm, magical scrapbook of 70s album covers, interviews, design sketches and backstage photos. Think Close Encounters of the Studio 54 kind.Priya ElanIf you haven’t read this fashion classic, now is the time, if only for the genesis chapter of the LBD: “It was a warm evening, nearly summer, and she wore a slim cool black dress, black sandals, and a pearl choker. For all her chic thinness, she had an almost breakfast-cereal air of health, a soap and lemon cleanness, a rough pink darkening of the cheeks.” The book that invented the Little Black Dress is full of sage style advice. “It’s tacky to wear diamonds before you’re 40, and even that’s risky. They only look right on the really old girls.”Jess Cartner-MorleyIf it’s a complete change of mood you want, look no further than Alexa Chung’s 2013 memoir-cum-picture-book. This scrapbook-style collection of the kinds of images beloved by fashion Instagram – Annie Hall, Anna Karina, Twiggy and, of course, Alexa herself – is ideal to fill the void between Zoom dates and online yoga. A pleasant, if surface-level, dip into the world of the not-yet-designer, filled with fun soundbites such as: “I am obsessed with moisturising. I am also obsessed with cigarettes – so I like to think the two balance each other out.” It feels surprisingly dated at times – but that’s not necessarily a bad thing right now. Leah HarperI wanted to see Kim Kardashian dressed up as Big Ben. I hoped Katy Perry would use a sundial as a fascinator. But this year’s Met Gala, which was to take place on 4 May, has been postponed. Luckily, the set text on which red carpet outfits were to be based is still ripe for enjoyment. Orlando is a funny, surreal, exuberant novel about a poet who lives from Elizabethan times until the early 20th century. It questions the very nature of time, which feels great right now. It is also brilliant on clothes as “a symbol of something hid deep beneath … The man has his hand free to seize his sword, the woman must use hers to keep the satins from slipping from her shoulders.” More than simply keeping us warm, Woolf argues, clothes “change our view of the world and the world’s view of us”, which makes me think I should raise my Google Hangouts game at some point. Hannah MarriottSet in the frock department of an upscale Sydney department store in 1959, this book was described as “a deceptively smart comic gem” by The New York Times Book Review when it was first published in 1993. Hilary Mantel has said it is “the book I most give as a gift to cheer people up”. The sassy attitude and jazzy aesthetic will appeal to fans of The Marvellous Mrs Maisel, while its thoughtful comedy of manners delivers just the right degree of escapism.Jess Cartner-MorleyIf you’re after a chilling insight into modern society, look no further than Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho. Not for the faint-hearted, this bitter black comedy depicts stomach-wrenching brutality, although its main focus is the yuppie Wall Street mentality of the sharply dressed protagonist Patrick Bateman. The narrative jumps suddenly from his thrill at purchasing a new pair of A Testoni loafers to scenes of extreme violence. Bateman is obsessed with his image from the finest clothes, as instructed in GQ, to the wealthy friends he hates, to being seen in the hottest clubs with the most attractive “hardbodies” he can find. It’s a portrayal of dissatisfaction that arises from presenting a perfect exterior but being hollow beneath, something more apt in today’s Instagram culture than ever. Not an easy read, but an engrossing one, and you will know what type of suit you can wear with cashmere socks once you are done.Peter BevanAudrey Withers, wartime editor of British Vogue, earned herself the nickname Austerity Withers for her gung-ho, can-do spirit. Beginning her editorship the day the blitz began in London, she achieved no mean feat in keeping the print magazine on shelves throughout the war. Vogue, she liked to say, was put to bed in a bunker like everyone else in London. This recent biography features jolly cameos from Cecil Beaton and Elizabeth David, but it is the stories of how her Vogue adapted its lifestyle to the zeitgeist, with features on growing your own vegetables and cutting your own hair, that make it perfect for today.Jess Cartner-MorleyWhen The Beautiful Fall came out in 2006, Karl Lagerfeld took author Alicia Drake to court for invasion of privacy. This fact should be enough to make anyone want to read the tale of Lagerfeld of fellow designer and frenemy Yves Saint Laurent from the 50s onwards. A mixture of gossip, hedonism, glamorous muses and fashion history, you will finish this with more knowledge of Parisian fashion over a key 40-year period, yes, but also an unmistakable desire to go disco dancing till the sun comes up, once quarantine is lifted.

Fabrizia Lanza, who was in charge at the school, reminded us that while it was a sensory session, not a lesson in citrus taxonomy, it was worth keeping in mind that most modern varieties are hybrids of three ancestral fruits: mandarin, pomelo and citron. We stood next to a huge table, each of the 28 varieties on one plate, one fruit cut open, the plates spread all over the table for what felt like a mad, aromatic tea party.We pressed, sniffed, scratched, squeezed, tasted and winced. I was reminded of being eight years old in the John Lewis perfume department, and while Mum talked intently to a heavenly assistant, I would spray myself and my clothes with as many samples as possible, and then feel as if I was going to keel over. What was interesting, though, was how quickly we acclimatised to the collective tornado of citrus scent, after a while finding it hard to smell anything, never mind define it. The solution was to go outside. Five minutes in the fresh air was all that was needed to recalibrate and appreciate the tidal wave of essential oils when you walked back in.At the end of the session we pushed the plates to one end of the table, ready to be sorted into piles: one for marmalade, one for preserving in sugar, one for the pigs – or we could take as much as we wanted. I was flying back to Rome the next morning, with hand luggage, which meant I had to resist my hoarding desire and pick just five.On the plane I pushed my bag under the seat in front. It was close and warm, so a few minutes later, I took my jumper off, and leant down to unzip my bag and shove my coat in it. The scent of the citrus rushed up at my face, and the woman’s next to me, too – she was delighted. So I pulled out my pompia fruit to show her. I had grabbed the fruit quickly the day before, noticing a strange ridge on it, but not taking it in completely. Now I did – we did. The cricket ball-sized fruit, with its yellowy-orange skin and wide open pores, had not just a ridge, but a sort of split, and a swelling, a tiny growth. There were no two ways about it even the shyest could not deny it – and especially not the delightful Sicilian octogenarian next to me: my citrus had a vagina.Back home, it sat for three days in pride of place on the top of the fruit bowl, and every day I took more delight in my fruit. On the fourth day, one side felt soft – it was too beautiful to waste, so that night we had a slice in our gin and tonic. The next day, with the rest, I made one one of my favourite dishes: spaghetti with lemon, basil and breadcrumbs for everyday grit.Serves 41 large lemon100ml olive oil120g parmesan, gratedSalt and black pepper1 handful basil leaves40g fine dry breadcrumbs400g spaghettiPut a large pan of salted water on to boil for the spaghetti. Prepare the breadcrumbs: heat a little olive oil in a pan and add the crumbs, along with a pinch of salt, pushing them around so they are toasted and smell like a digestive biscuit. Pull from the heat and tip into a bowl.Once the water boils, add the pasta and cook until al dente.Meanwhile, grate the zest from the lemon and then squeeze the juice from it – you want four tablespoons. Tear the basil into little pieces.In a large warm bowl, whisk together the juice and zest with the olive oil, parmesan, and salt and pepper to taste.Either drain the pasta, saving some of the cooking water, or use tongs to lift the spaghetti directly into the lemon bowl.

Trim the ends and peel any of the tougher stalks, then slice the rest into slender strips to mimic the shape of the tagliatelle.Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the packet instructions, adding the broccoli for the last three minutes until it’s completely tender. Drain both, keeping back half a cup of the pasta water, then tip both pasta and broccoli into the sauce bowl, and stir well so that every strand is covered. Wait for a minute and then add a splash of the pasta water if necessary, to loosen things up. Check for seasoning again and serve on hot plates with a little extra cheese.The sauce is great folded into leftover risotto to make cheesy arancini balls.

But, on a sunny morning in São Paulo, behind his aviator sunglasses and neatly trimmed moustache, he looks relaxed and content. Well he might. We are talking before the coronavirus pandemic shook the world and Scolari has been kicking back at home. “I’ve been on the beach for two months, every day,” he says. “It’s the first time I’ve been able to do that in 50 years.”Scolari has been out of work since being sacked by Palmeiras in September and has been spending time in his native Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil’s southernmost state, to plan his next steps and mull over the last half century. There is rather a lot to reflect on. As a manager he has worked in eight countries and been to three World Cups. There was a winner’s medal in 2002 and two more semi-final appearances, the second of which we will come to later.Before that, there was a decade as a professional centre-back for a few middling Brazilian clubs. He describes himself, in his matter of fact, bullet-point style, as a “useful and effective” player. “It was rare that I lost a 50-50,” he says. “I had a lot of physical strength. I commanded my colleagues on the pitch. At 20, I was already captain. If there was a problem, I sorted it. If there were 40 games in the year, I played 39. I was a good player doing what I did for that team. I wasn’t flashy. I wasn’t technical.”When he started out, he combined playing for Caxias, where he spent most of his career, with a degree and a job as a PE teacher. His father did not want him to follow a career in football. “He wanted me to study, to go into another profession”, says Scolari. The compromise was that he would do both.At the time, Caxias played in the top flight of the Rio Grande do Sul state championship and Série A of the Brazilian national league. “These days, that’s unthinkable. I worked for seven or eight years as a teacher. I worked Monday morning, and on the mornings and evenings on Thursdays and Fridays. The rest of the time I trained and played.” The first trophy he ever lifted as coach was the state schools’ cup with a side that included current Brazil manager Tite. “It was hard, but it was a great time in my life. I learned a lot. I lived with different kinds of people, with kids, with my club colleagues, with my school colleagues. It was good for the formation of my character.”That teacherly demeanour, with stern brow and exacting glare, has not faded. In Brazil he is renowned as a safety-first tactician, knockout tournament specialist and a master of man management. “I knew to which point I could influence people to grow, to play better, to be better people in their lives,” he says, “All of these things that I saw as a manager, I learned in school as a teacher.”Looking back, particularly from a European perspective, there is a temptation to see Scolari’s triumph at the World Cup in 2002 as an inevitable consequence of the bountiful attacking talent at his disposal. But when he took over the Seleção in July 2001, Brazil were on to their fourth manager in three years and looked like they might not qualify. “At that time the Seleção didn’t have a great relationship with the people,” he recalls. “The fans didn’t believe. The mistrust continued we’d win a game, then lose another.” It went down to the last round of qualifying games, with Brazil finally securing a place in Japan and South Korea thanks to a 3-0 win over Venezuela.From there, a meticulous plan was put in place to prepare the team for the following summer. Their triumph, he says, owed as much to this foresight as it did to the skill of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo. “Our doctors were fundamental. Our system of logistics was extremely well organised. People think: ‘Brazil have quality.’ They don’t imagine that the logistics are important, but they are. They think: ‘Brazilian players don’t need looking after because they’re highly technical.’ No. They need care.As well as those three centre-backs, he also had great defensive midfielders. “I had the good fortune to find a player who knew how to position himself in front of this group. It was the work of destiny.” First-choice midfielder Emerson was injured in a training game on the eve of the tournament and Gilberto Silva replaced him. I mention that Arsenal fans refer to Gilberto as “The Invisible Wall”. “That’s the best definition I’ve heard,” Scolari responds with a smile. “He gave a platform to Edmilson, the full-backs. He allowed them to work.”He also heaps praise on Juninho Paulista and the man who replaced him in the knockout stages, Kleberson, who he calls the team’s “little ant” due to his workrate. It is a reflection of Scolari’s ethos. Commitment is key without it, inidual talent cannot shine.“Then I looked and,” – he lets out a long sigh – “I relaxed a bit. I saw they were concerned, they had trained, prepared themselves. But they were confident. That was what won us the title. We played as if it were a normal game.”They had knocked England out in the quarter-finals, the first of three meetings that Sven-Göran Eriksson’s men would have with Scolari – the next two as manager of Portugal – in consecutive major tournaments. Each match was marked by one of those curious occurrences that define summers.In 2002, it was Ronaldinho’s infamous equaliser. “He wasn’t trying to score, he was trying to cross”, Felipão says, bluntly dismissing the player’s version of events. “Seaman took two steps forwards and that was it.”In Lisbon two years later penalties. Hélder Postiga’s Panenka, Ricardo’s gloveless heroics. “I didn’t know what Ricardo was doing. I didn’t understand. Everyone was perplexed. I don’t know if it was a way of inhibiting the adversary, if it was a feeling that he had. But he takes his gloves off, saves the penalty and then takes the last penalty. Sometimes as a coach you have to authorise the players to use their personality.”In that match in Gelsenkirchen, Wayne Rooney was sent off for a kick on Manchester United teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. Scolari’s predilection for the dark arts is no secret. Did he send his players out to wind up the young England forward? “No, no, no. We don’t have that capacity to imagine that the adversary might do something like that”, he says, slightly unconvincingly. “But among the players, they know. They know who’s more explosive.”The England job escaped him but he was given a chance to move to London in July 2008, when Roman Abramovich brought him in to replace Avram Grant at Chelsea. It started well and the Blues were top of the league until late November. But Scolari was sacked in early February 2009 after some poor results exacerbated issues that had bubbled under the surface. “Chelsea had some problems with injuries, some problems in the team. I had a form of leadership that clashed with one or two players,” he says. Who? “Anelka and Drogba.”“When he came back, I tried to adapt so that Drogba and Anelka could play together. Anelka was the top scorer in the league. We had a meeting and Anelka said: ‘I only play in one position.’ So, there was a bit of a lack of friendship, of respect, of trying to play together with Drogba. They were both great, but someone had to do something different, to get back to help when we lost the ball. That was when it changed a bit. But we’ve met since then, me and Drogba. The last time was in Russia in 2018. We spoke openly about it. There wasn’t any ill intention from him or Anelka. But it happened and I lost out on one of the great chances of my life.There was another World Cup, too just as well remembered, if for all the wrong reasons. In 2012, a decade after the glory in Japan, he was back leading the Seleção. And at first, it was brilliant. After the Confederations Cup win at the Maracanã in 2013, the team was dripping in confidence and the nation was exploding with anticipation. A year later, the unthinkable happened.Was that confidence misplaced did it hinder them? For the first time, Scolari is slightly evasive, umming and ahhing before replying. “I don’t know if it got in the way. I can say that we played and won the games in the way that we knew we were going to win, some with a bit more difficulty.Before the game Júlio César and David Luiz held up the shirt of Neymar, who had been injured in the quarter-final against Colombia, a moment that has been interpreted as indicative of the team’s overly emotional state. “It’s easy to criticise afterwards. If we had won, that would have been a heroic act. No. It was a way of showing that one of their friends was missing. It’s not in this way that we’re going to find the justification.“We lost because we didn’t play well, because we had momentary lapses of concentration. We lost because of the quality of Germany. We lost because we didn’t have the opportunity to position ourselves to make things difficult for Germany. I’m not going to look for justifications that are not the normal justifications of football.“In the first 10, 15 minutes, we were playing an even game. Everything was equal until the first Germany goal. After that, we conceded three in seven minutes. Then there was a general pane.” The word is an interesting one pane in Portuguese is usually employed to describe a machine or motor malfunctioning. “There was a mistake from one player, a mistake from another. We couldn’t stop them. Germany took advantage. They were a very good team. And that was it.”A month later, he was back in a job with Grêmio, where he had enjoyed a glorious spell in the mid-1990s. He had originally intended to take some time to “think and reorganise”, but Grêmio wanted a firm hand to manage the club through a financial restructuring and promote youth-team prospects such as Everton and Arthur, who have since gone on to represent the Seleção. For Scolari, immersing himself in a job at the club he supported as a boy was the best remedy.He has since gone on to achieve success in China with Guangzhou Evergrande, before returning to Brazil in 2018 with Palmeiras, where he won Série A. It was his 24th club trophy as a manager and came a full three decades after his first. After getting knocked out of the Copa Libertadores last year, a group of ultras made death threats against him, but after all these years, it takes more than that to faze him. “I wasn’t bothered,” he chuckles. “You can’t be scared of people who are strong in a group but not when they’re alone.”At 71, he is still hoping to return to the game. But he does not appear in a desperate hurry, which, given the current circumstances, is just as well. If he does come back, though, he promises he will put all that experience and the replenished energy from his time on the beach to good use. “I’ve watched the Premier League. I’ve watched games in Brazil. I’ve had time to examine the games, examine teams and the goals that have been scored. I’ll come back better than I was before.”• This is an article from Yellow \u0026amp Green Football• Follow them on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter• And follow Joshua Law on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a637ae81af7a94d05a6d07f92b526162b56d5ca6/0_0_1032_619/master/1032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=278840ee2b9706c15058621b2beb05d3","title":"how we met gay men open marriage relationship","story":"Dan Butler, 29, a radio journalist, and his husband, Hugh O’Connor, 31, a theatre production designer, are also in a relationship with Charles Davis, 28, another theatre production designer Dan remembers one evening, sitting on the sofa and talking to his husband, Hugh, about Charles. “It was the most amazing experience because we were really falling in love with this person,” he says. “And we could talk about it with each other, like: ‘Isn’t it amazing about him that he does this thing?’ I remember taking a deep breath and saying: ‘This is becoming something this is something real.’”Dan and Hugh, who live in Sydney, have been together for eight years, but this was about five years into their relationship. They had met as students at a party. “At some point, the cops came and shut it down,” says Hugh. “I said to a whole load of people in the street: ‘Do you want to come back to my house?’ I wasn’t ready to stop having a good time. Dan and I started talking, and on the way home we talked about Carl Sagan and Beyoncé. We covered a pretty wide range of topics.” They carried on talking all night, and “danced to Roy Ayers’ Everybody Loves the Sunshine really quietly at one point in the night so as not to wake up my housemates. And then the night was over and Dan was one of the last people there. He said: ‘Goodbye, Hugh.’ And I thought: ‘Oh my God. I have no idea what this guy’s name is. I really like him.’”Hugh tracked him down on Facebook, and they went on a date about three weeks later. “We stayed together all afternoon, and then it got dark, so we went for dinner and then for a romantic stroll,” says Dan. Hugh continues: “We had our first kiss. And then Dan said he wouldn’t come home with me, which also made him very attractive.”“It had been such a perfect night,” Dan says, “and I thought: ‘I don’t need anything else.’ Anyway, we got together the next night.”They moved in with each other after about two months, and held an unofficial wedding in 2014, before same-sex marriage in Australia was legal. They legalised their marriage in 2018, and this time Charles attended.Charles and Hugh had known each other since university, although not well, and Charles and Dan had also met briefly. Later, Charles ended up renting studio space from Hugh. “We became friends again, and then really good friends. And then I became friends with Dan through Hugh,” says Charles. They started hanging out as a trio, going swimming or having dinner and watching a film.“Before the three of us got together romantically and sexually, I remember feeling the happiest I’d ever felt with Dan,” says Hugh. “And then when we met Charlie. It was like this extension of a really positive energy. Charlie just slotted into that, seamlessly, without any of us trying to make it happen.”Dan and Hugh had had an open marriage from the start. “I think gay men are able to negotiate that quite easily,” says Hugh. “But I don’t think Dan and I ever thought that would extend to an emotional romantic involvement.”Charles also had a boyfriend, but that, too, was an open relationship, “so we weren’t necessarily breaking any rules”, he says. “But we were going to the beach together a lot because it was the start of spring. I remember one morning, the three of us had just gone to the beach and Hugh had a meeting, so Dan and I drove Hugh back to the studio. And then Dan drove me back to my suburb and dropped me off. I think he leaned in and kissed me. We were parked outside my apartment block and I looked across the street and saw my boyfriend. In that crystallising moment, I realised that I was in an emotional relationship with these two people.”They all got together in late 2017. Was it strange to join an existing relationship? “In many ways, it felt completely normal and natural,” says Charles, “but there were these habits and rituals that these two people had built up over the years – things such as where you go in the morning to get your coffee and all that. I guess the challenge for me was knowing when to roll with it, and when I needed to make sure that I established my own routines and rituals – and my own stake in the relationship.”How did Hugh and Dan navigate bringing someone else into their marriage? “I guess like we’ve navigated every other part of our relationship,” says Hugh. “By being honest about what we’re feeling, and talking to each other. And not having any expectation of how we were meant to behave and feel. Allowing each other to feel different emotions, whether it’s jealousy, resentment, anger, happiness, joy, connectedness.” Dan says: “I always try to impress upon people just how easy and natural it was at the beginning, as any burst of love is when you first get together with somebody.”It was “more strange”, says Charles, “for the people around us than it was for us. We’re fortunate in that we all we run in very liberal circles, and all our families are very progressive. But most of the people we spoke to, the first thing they would say would be: ‘Oh, I could never do that myself.’ It’s unfathomable to so many people.”Hugh and Dan live together, and Charles lives five minutes away. “Hugh and I exist in our marriage, and that’s one thing. And we also have our relationship with Charles,” says Dan. “We both try to keep that healthy by seeing each other inidually, and then the three of us spend a fair bit of time hanging out as well. Like any relationship, it’s still changing.”During the lockdown, Hugh and Dan are not seeing Charles in person but doing a lot of video calling. “We talked about being together for a lockdown, but we don’t have enough space,” says Dan. “That aside, we don’t think this is a good time or reason for us to begin living together.”Is there jealousy? Do they worry that one day two of them will go off with each other and leave the third? “People always say that,” says Dan. “And sometimes I do. But being in an open relationship means that you actually confront those feelings, you start to look at the reason for them and you can work on eliminating them. I am a far less jealous person now than when I started my relationship with Hugh and also with Charles, too. It forces you to do quite a bit of self-reflection because it puts you in these quite intense situations.”The relationship works, he says, “because everyone still wants to be in it”. A thruple makes sense, Charles says, because they’re not trying to get all their needs met by one partner: “I get something quite different from Hugh than I get from Dan. And I hope that I offer Hugh something that Dan can’t, and vice versa.”• Want to share your story?

Today, music to see you through from 30 March to 3 April• Browse our picks from week one: Igor Levit, Il Trovatore and the Berlin PhilIt’s well worth negotiating the frustrations of the Berlin Philharmonic’s voucher system to gain free access to its digital concert hall, where there’s a huge archive of concerts going back to the orchestra’s vintage years under Herbert von Karajan. There’s a decent number of new works, too, especially among the programmes conducted by Simon Rattle, while the most recent of them is Hans Abrahamsen’s Horn Concerto, whose premiere, with the Berlin Phil’s principal horn Stefan Dohr as the immaculate soloist, is the centrepiece of a concert under Paavo Järvi. It’s framed by “fantastic” works – a rare outing for Stravinsky’s early, Rimsky-esque Scherzo Fantastique, and Berlioz’s famous symphony – and there’s an element of fantasy about the concerto, too. The horn, with its all its Romantic associations with the worlds of legend and magic, seems to be cast as the storyteller, leading the orchestra through a series of enchanted landscapes, all coloured by the fragile, intricate patterning that is a feature of Abrahamsen’s music. (Digital concert hall footage is free for 30 days after registering) Andrew ClementsStathis Livathinos’s 2017 staging of Verdi’s Aida jettisons Egyptological convention in favour of something altogether more abstract and timeless, to create an unnerving interpretation of a work often seen primarily in terms of orientalist spectacle. Using imagery that borders on surrealism, Livathinos probes the opera’s narrative to expose a decadent, imperialist society that maintains a veneer of civilisation while remaining in thrall to the theocratic values of Giacomo Prestia’s literally monstrous Ramfis and his dog-headed priests. Stylised gestures for chorus and dancers, meanwhile, choreographed by Otto Pichler, remind us of the opera’s often overlooked closeness to the rituals of classical tragedy. Conducted with reined-in intensity by Alain Altinoglu, it’s superbly acted if at times unevenly sung. Andrea Carè’s Radamès doesn’t settle until after Celeste Aida, which is a shame. Later on, however, you get a real sense of the conflict between desire and duty that he and Adina Aaron’s anguished Aida must face as Nora Gubisch’s imperious, tellingly repressed Amneris conspires against them. It’s sometimes flawed, often idiosyncratic, but always never less than mesmerising. (Available until 19 April) Tim AshleyThe musicians of the often quirkily brilliant Budapest Festival Orchestra were among the first to identify live-streaming during the crisis as both an opportunity and a necessity – their Quarantine Soirees, which began on 16 March (and from which we nicked the name of our page), are preceded by music director Iván Fischer pointing us to a donation page, since “at the moment this is their only possible income”. They offer a lucky dip of chamber music: Sunday night’s instalment included Chopin and Debussy piano works alongside Dvorák’s “American” string quartet, dashed off with the kind of relaxed, risk-taking flair you expect of the Hungarian fiddle tradition Monday’s had Biber, Piazzolla, Elgar, and brass quartet versions of The Pink Panther and La Bamba. The sound is close-miked but clear, and there’s a rather endearing lack of atmosphere. Everything is broadcast from a bare rehearsal room, and presented with a minimum of fuss. At the end, they bow to a silent room you supply the applause. (Every night from 7.45pm (CET), for around an hour) Erica JealVerdi’s final masterpiece ought to provide the perfect comic refuge in these times, but there is something strangely joyless and unfunny about Calixto Bieito’s staging, unveiled in Hamburg in January. On the plus side, there’s real zest to Axel Kober’s conducting and some fine inidual performances, especially from Ambrogio Maestri in the title role, lustrous-toned and immaculate in phrase and diction, but whose sense of faded nobility is undermined by a production that reduces too much to the sleaziest common denominator, and presents him as an out-and-out slob, shambling around in increasingly grubby vests. It’s all updated to a back-street pub somewhere in Britain today (far too shabby to be Windsor), while Falstaff’s humiliation in the final scene seems to take place at a well-populated dogging site. Bieito’s view of present-day Britain is a pitiless one and with his updating we lose the class distinctions that are so carefully defined in both Boito’s libretto and its Shakespearean sources. Original ideas are scant and hardly revelatory: Nannetta’s covert pregnancy test suggests that her relationship with Fenton is already well advanced Meg Page and Mistress Quickly seem to be a bit more than good friends, while to judge from their venomous exchanges during the final fugue, the Fords at least won’t be living happily ever after. If in the end Verdi’s extraordinary score manages to sweep all before it, as it always does, it’s a close-run thing. (Available on ARTE until 18 April) Andrew ClementsNot a long-haul concert this, but any chance to celebrate the supreme artistry of Martha Argerich is welcome. Winning the Chopin competition at 24 was a milestone in her early career, and there is clearly a sentimental connection between soloist and audience as she plays Chopin’s E minor Piano Concerto in Warsaw’s Philharmonic Hall, with the Sinfonia Varsovia, back in 2010. Argerich combines her typically robust, no-nonsense approach with the most lyrical cantabile, with something intense and simply life-enhancing about her performance. This recording focuses less on the orchestra than Argerich herself, so one gets closer to the hands – surprisingly workwoman-like – and the almost nonchalantly virtuosic technique, but also to Argerich’s engagement with the music and the musicians. Her expressions can reflect Chopin anguish, but there are also moments of radiance that say it all. Two lovely encores are a great bonus.

An extension of the transition period is the only responsible thing to do.”David McAllister, the German MEP who leads the European parliament’s work on the future relationship with the UK, said the pandemic complicated an “already very ambitious” schedule. “The ball is now clearly in the British court,” he added.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.Under the withdrawal agreement, the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December 2020, terminating British membership of the EU single market and customs union. But it can be extended for one or two years if both sides agree by 1 July.The EU has made little secret it would back any extension request, but the British government continues to rule that out.Responding to the EPP statement, a UK government spokesperson said: “The transition period ends on 31 December 2020, as enshrined in UK law, which the prime minister has made clear he has no intention of changing.”The plea for extra time comes as British and EU politicians prepared to hold their first meeting to discuss putting in place the Irish Sea border. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, was due to hold a conference call with the European commission’s vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, on Monday to discuss how to implement the agreement on the Irish border. The pair were also due to discuss citizens’ rights, amid concern from campaigners that the coronavirus crisis would make it harder for European Union nationals in the UK to secure their status.Following the meeting, the two sides issued separate statements and each described talks as “constructive”. However, the EU struck a more insistent tone, saying there was an “urgent need” for a timetable on putting into place customs procedures and animal health checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.EU officials have been alarmed by repeated statements from the prime minister that there will not be controls on goods crossing this internal UK border – a statement that contradicts what he agreed in the withdrawal agreement.The British government stated it was committed “to upholding our obligations under the Northern Ireland protocol”.The latest talks were not intended to touch on the future relationship, amid rising doubts about the prospects for agreeing an unprecedented deal ning trade, security and fishing rights by the end of the year.British and EU negotiators had concluded only three and a half days of formal talks before the coronavirus struck Europe heavily. A second round due to be held in London earlier this month was scrapped, while next week’s talks seem unlikely to go ahead, despite previous hopes of running them by video conference.British officials say they continue to explore video-conferencing. But it’s not a simple fix. At least 10 to 20 people can take part in just one thematic topic for each side, making virtual talks complicated to organise when iniduals are working from home. Talks may cover about 10 different themes.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has the virus, while his UK opposite number, David Frost, has symptoms and has gone into self-isolation. Officials on both sides say they are in regular contact."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/566c9a5285ae81874ccd780cd735a062756912b0/0_22_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c0af25cb96d3ebef1d28a9dee89908e","title":"jade jones tokyo olympics delay taekwondo team gb","story":"Britain’s two-time taekwondo gold medallist is staying positive following the Tokyo Games move to summer 2021 – partly because it means she can still create historyA week since the Tokyo Olympics were postponed in response to the coronavirus outbreak there is a need among the athletes affected to move on and focus on the positives. That is certainly what Jade Jones is doing. The two-time taekwondo gold medallist admits she felt “gutted” following last Tuesday’s news but now her mindset has well and truly changed.The pursuit of history is key to why Jones is refusing to mope. Tokyo offers her the chance to become the first athlete in her sport to claim three Olympic golds and she is ultimately relieved that she can still achieve that milestone. “If the Olympics had been cancelled, as opposed to postponed, that would’ve broken me as I wouldn’t then have had a chance to do what no one else in taekwondo has ever done,” she says. “I’m just grateful the Olympics are still on.“Mentally, it’s tough. I’ve been training for four years for that one moment and, as an athlete, you try to peak for that. All the training and preparation is geared towards that … and then it’s gone. But it had got to the stage where it was hard to carry on anyway as all of our training camps and competitions were getting cancelled. At least after last week’s announcement we now know where we stand. We also have another year to become even better athletes.”Just over a year, in fact, after the International Olympic Committee announced on Monday that the Games will begin on 23 July next year, with the Paralympic Games starting on 24 August. When athletes will be able to start training and competing given enforced self‑isolation is another matter and while that is naturally a worry for all concerned it is not a huge issue for Jones given she has been able to set up a gym at the house she shares in Manchester with friend and fellow British taekwondo competitor, Bianca Walkden.“As soon as we were told the Team GB academy was shutting we zoomed down there in the car, grabbed as much kit as we could and took it home,” says Jones. “We then chucked everything we had in the garage and spent a day fixing it up. I’m actually quite chuffed with it. And I’ve always wanted a home gym, so at least that’s something I’ve been able to achieve during all of this.“I’m also spending time allowing my body to recover. As an athlete training takes a big toll on you, so I’m getting all the right nutrients down me as well as using the recovering stuff that’s been provided by my sponsors, Under Armour. I’m trying to turn every second at home into a positive.”But that can be difficult. Jones is missing seeing her family back in north Wales – “not being able to go home and give them a hug is hard” – and there is only so far forcing yourself to look on the bright side can go when you have had the rug sharply pulled from underneath your feet.Jones should be in a pre-Olympics training camp right now before flying out to Tokyo on 14 July. And there is little doubt the 27-year-old stood an excellent chance of securing that third succcessive gold medal in the Japanese capital. Quite simply, Jones is one of the very best around in her sport, as shown by the world championship gold she secured in Manchester last May.“I’m not going to lie, it took me a few days to get my head around the fact the Olympics were not going to take place this summer,” she says. “I found out at the same time as everyone else, while watching the news, and I was gutted.“Besides, sport is pretty unimportant right now. What is important is the health of my family and friends and everybody around the world.”That much is true and, eventually, life will return to normal. For Jones that will mean getting out of her home gym and into the one she uses at Team GB’s academy, working alongside her coach, Martin Stamper, and gearing up for what is now next year’s 2020 Games.“What’s for sure is that it’s going to be a crappy couple of months and my biggest worry is that spending all this time at home will lead to me getting fat,” Jones says with a laugh. “But it will end at some point and then it will be a case of re-planning for the Olympics and making sure I’m once again in peak condition at the right time. That’s a lot to take in right now but I’m ready for the challenge. A champion always finds a way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3223667d80362074350e9755aa0c9e5c98bb3d16/0_0_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=248866446a73662606bd89365d0845a4","title":"peace and dignity journeys ultramarathon noe alvarez","story":"When Noé Álvarez joined an extraordinary ultramarathon he tested himself physically and mentally, while also connecting with his heritageWhile jogging on the spot, Mexican-American runner Noé Álvarez showed his passport to the border agent in Nogales, Arizona. Álvarez was participating in the Peace and Dignity Journeys (PDJ), an ultramarathon for runners of indigenous background like himself. His group had run 3,200 miles from the Arctic to the US border with Mexico. They still had miles to go before their destination of the Panama Canal, but for Álvarez, the crossing into Mexico had extra meaning – it was the homeland of his parents before they immigrated to the US. The border agent, a fellow Latino, smirkingly asked if he was running in the wrong direction.It’s an emotional moment in Álvarez’s new memoir, Spirit Run: A 6,000-Mile Marathon Through North America’s Stolen Land. The book chronicles not only that epic run in 2004 but also the background of the author and his immigrant parents.“I feel like I’m still writing it,” Álvarez says. “It continues to inform my life. It took me years to figure out how I was going to tell it.” Ultimately, he decided on uniting the beauty of the journey and the messy moments along the way “through the medium of running.”And what a run it was. The PDJ is a quadrennial event intended to reconnect indigenous participants with their ancestral land, with the latest edition, which had been due to take place this year, cancelled due to the Covid-19 outbreak. In 2004, Álvarez’s group was heading south to rendezvous with another group running north from Argentina.There were unexpected difficulties -- an encounter between Álvarez and a mountain lion in Oregon, stone-throwing motorists in Mexico, and tensions between the author and some of his fellow runners. And he didn’t quite finish the way he intended to. But the first-time author has come to find satisfaction in both the run and his life trajectory.He received a full scholarship to Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, but says he felt “cultural shock on all sorts of levels. I had difficulties, there was the shame of failing, I could not save my family.” Serendipitously, he learned of the PDJ from “a friend of a friend of a friend.”“I had to do this,” Álvarez explains. “It was part of my escape. I was not connected to college at the time. It was not how I needed to learn. College was joining the run.”He joined one month in, after the group had started its journey from Alaska. Their paths crossed in British Columbia. Fellow runners collectively represented nine indigenous communities.“It was interesting to see how fluid and multilayered our identities were,” he says of his fellow participants, whom he portrays through composite characters in the book. They included runners of Mexican heritage living in Canada, and “an elder, our spiritual guide, from the Arctic.” He noted that there were “some former gang and military members and others completely living off the land,” and women runners committed to “female energy, healing power, balance.”PDJ runners start and end each day with a ceremony, and carry feathered staffs during the run. Daily destinations are indigenous communities across North America. At each stop, community members share an important cultural story with the runners, signifying the story with a feather to add to the staff. Sometimes they also shared running traditions, including running as a group in the Tohono O’odham territory in the Arizona desert.Álvarez, who had never run more than 10 miles in a day, would receive myriad tests. The PDJ takes place relay-style, with each runner committing to a certain amount of mileage each day while others wait their turn while traveling by motor vehicle. He learned to eat on the run, finding that a hard-boiled egg stuffed into his pocket might not be the wisest nourishment with wildlife around. He and his fellow runners slept in all manner of venues, from campgrounds to casinos, and encountered varying terrain, from the forests of Canada to the deserts of Washington and Arizona to the jungles of Mexico.“It was not just running blindly,” Álvarez says. “It’s a story about why land is important to people.” He noted that in the Canadian forests, trees were being cut down for the ski industry and the Winter Olympics, while more arid areas were suffering from drought.“We honored the land that a lot of people depend on,” Álvarez says. “We were physically walking, running and connecting with it every step of the way.”In Oregon, he made an unexpected connection – a mountain lion waiting for him atop a peak.“I was completely unprepared,” Álvarez recalls. “I couldn’t run back. I had to keep moving forward.” He says that when he joined the run, “one guy, a really good friend and spiritual guide, talked about how to be thankful for the presence of an animal that decides to notice you, sort of take it as a message, an opportunity to reflect.”In the book, Álvarez describes the mix of gratitude and footwork that helped him escape the big cat. “Luckily, I’m still here,” he says. “I did some studies on what you’re supposed to do, and they said definitely don’t run. It’s definitely the dumbest thing I probably ever did.”After the group crossed into Mexico, they encountered a different kind of danger: people who threw rocks from cars. Female runners were also at risk of assault Álvarez describes one attempt that left some runners wary of continuing.“We came across situations with real shady encounters, people trying to force you into a vehicle, throw rocks at you, who didn’t want you there,” Álvarez says. “We adjusted, ran in pairs … Some territories were extremely unsafe. If you didn’t want to run, you didn’t have to. Others took on the miles.”Ultimately, it was a familiar runner’s story – injury – that determined Álvarez would finished his run in Guatemala before he could reach the Panama Canal. He calls it “the toughest decision, probably, I ever had to make.”“I didn’t want to quit,” he says. “But knowing when to quit was part of the lesson.”This lesson has stayed with him ever since – as has the border officer’s question about whether he was running in the wrong direction.“I no longer think about the wrong direction,” Álvarez says. “I have a line of inquiry now, a ritual of asking the questions I need to.” And, he says, “Running is the way I process things now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75798746ed4612793fc85ad937a2ceb720c6534a/0_237_5376_3226/master/5376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e03c1543cb1e9b5b10d8d273ca0fe90e","title":"small sport coronavirus lockdown olympic legacy","story":"Jogging round the block. A bike ride in the park. An online yoga class. We must take what we can getSo, how’s quarantine going for you? For me, perhaps the most striking discovery of the past couple of weeks is the revelation that my many deferred and undone tasks – the books not read, the films not watched, the camera rolls not tidied, the shelves not rearranged – were never meant to be done at all.Shakespeare may famously have written King Lear while in plague quarantine but then Shakespeare never had to contend with Instagram Stories, internet chess and an online quiz with the irresistible title “Name Every England Test Cricketer of the 2010s”. (Ajmal Shahzad is the one that gets most people.)Despite this new abundance of spare time, then, my to-do list remains as stubbornly considerable as ever and it occurs to me now that in compiling these endless, sprawling lists – “buy compost”, “print wedding photos”, “sew holes in socks” – I was articulating not a genuine need but an archetype.I did not, as it turned out, actually want to sew the holes in my socks, an assignment that once undertaken (and this is the other dirty little secret about to-do lists) would immediately detonate three more, namely “research sewing equipment”, “buy sewing kit” and “learn to sew”. Instead, I was asserting a wish to be the kind of guy who wants to sew up the holes in his socks. For this reason alone, the socks must never be sewn. To do so would defeat the entire point of the task.And yet in among such bleak realisations, such yawning ennui, such dispiriting dispatches, there is one important aspect where life has improved immeasurably. If David Foster Wallace describes sport as human beings’ reconciliation with having a body, then the same might easily be said of its absence. Deprived of the throbbing bombast of Big Sport, perhaps this is the moment when we seek solace in its unassuming older sibling: the modest, sweat-ringed pleasures of Small Sport.In a sense, many of the activities that come under the banner of Small Sport are the sort of thing that many people would barely classify as sport at all. Jogging around the block. A bike ride in the park. An online yoga class in the living room. A brief but vigorous press-up routine in the bedroom. Even Eurosport would balk at showing some of this stuff. But locked down and locked indoors, we must take what we can get.In this context, the government’s stipulation that exercise is one of the few legitimate reasons for leaving the house feels less like a permission and more like an imperative. The Association of Cycle Traders has reported a surge in sales of bicycles and cycle equipment. Fitness and workout apps are doing a roaring trade. And every other afternoon I slip on a pair of trainers and join the throngs of grimacing, carefully spaced runners on the London streets: not all of whom, you surmise, can be exiles from the gym or the athletics club.Perhaps it’s possible to read into all this things that are not really there. Perhaps there is a danger of extrapolating all sorts of fantastical trends from this extremely narrow and unusual set of circumstances. But one of the most appealing traits of sport is the way it reels you in, little by little. The daily jog leads to a half-marathon. The Sunday bike ride leads to a sportive. The idle darts practice leads one day to an idle Google search for local pub leagues. We are, above all, creatures of habit and during this enforced incarceration many of us are grooving habits that may prove tough to shake on parole.There is a certain irony in all this. For decades, we have been told that the only legitimate model of driving mass sporting participation is the top-down approach: spectacle, exemplar, extravaganza.It is a convenient falsehood cruelly exposed by the firework-laden, Bowie-themed sophistry of London 2012, which derived its justification and vast public expense from the fanciful idea that watching the world’s best canoeists and modern pentathletes would send us all stampeding down to our local white water centre or wherever it is people go to do modern pentathlon. The more prosaic reality? Providing a nation with hours and hours of cracking television to enjoy from their sofas does not – remarkably enough – make them more outdoorsy.And so it would be quaintly paradoxical if it turned out the key to generating our Olympic legacy was to trap us in our own homes with no sport to watch.“Imprison A Generation” may not be the sort of feel-good slogan you can put on a Games Maker T-shirt, but perhaps in these times we can be reminded that there is an alternative vision of sport out there: one free of Ticketmaster queues and security bag searches and separate hospitality entrances and Kiss Cam and £6 pints. One that rearticulates sport not as something you sit and pay for but something you get up and do.In one sense, this is simply a rehash of the old Foucauldian trope of the body as locus of historic power struggle. In another, it’s the time-honoured human instinct known as “needing to get out of the bloody house”. After all, the resistance takes many forms. Lift a kettlebell. Do a downward dog. Go for a run.Somehow, in an age of curtailed freedoms and frightening state power, the simple repetitive movements of Small Sport can feel like the most empowering of comforts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d1f6ba63b9c9efccef83e5905bdacb196bb6145/0_190_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a912b8c6af1802bd67177f84ef7a74f5","title":"usa rugby files for bankruptcy as coronavirus takes toll on game","story":"The board of USA Rugby has voted to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy as a result of “insurmountable financial constraints” in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

Based near Brandsby in North Yorkshire, Beaumont was a quiet man who never sought the limelight and never had more than 30 horses under his care but had a fantastic eye for a long-distance steeplechaser and won some of the sport’s biggest prizes.“I’d say he was one of the last of the old-style trainer,” said Brendan Powell, who won the Scottish Grand National in 1999 aboard Beaumont’s Young Kenny and became a friend to the trainer. “You can see why he’d have those long-distance chasers because he did the long, slow work with them. They were fit, they were well. “He was probably a brilliant stockman, being a farmer as well. I don’t think he ever bought expensive horses. He bought them all as young horses and brought them on. He was patient and he’d run them when things were right. He never had 60 or 70 winners a year but by God he trained some decent horses over the years.”The best of them was Jodami, who stayed on strongly to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1993, with three other winners of the race among the defeated. He was the first horse to win the Irish Gold Cup three times, back in the days when the race was known as the Hennessy, and he was also second in the Irish Grand National, carrying almost two stones more than the other horses in the first five.The massive Young Kenny was also a force to be reckoned with in marathon handicaps, winning a Midlands National and a Becher as well as his more famous triumph at Ayr. Beaumont’s other stars included the Festival winner Hussard Collonges, the dual Tommy Whittle winner Bobby Grant, and Niki Dee, who was third in Papillon’s Grand National.But perhaps the most satisfying moment of his career came in 1991, when J-J Henry won the Topham over the National fences, ridden by his daughter, Anthea Morshead. When he decided to retire almost 20 years later, Beaumont noted: “Anthea is still the only girl to have beaten the professionals round there”. Another decade later, it remains true.“I’m heartbroken,” Morshead told the Racing Post. “He just died in his sleep. It’s a lovely way to go, it truly was very peaceful. He just slept and didn’t wake up.”Beaumont’s Gold Cup glory came at a time when low-profile trainers could still hope to carry off jump racing’s most prestigious trophy, as Sirrell Griffiths had done three years ealier and Fergie Sutherland would do three years later. Coneygree’s win for the Bradstocks in 2015 shows miracles can still happen but, in these days of super-stables stacked with the best prospects, they come along less often.Tributes were also paid on Monday to the owner Paul Townend, who had shares in horses at the stables of Martin Keighley and Joe Tuite. Keighley shared a picture of himself with Townend at Royal Ascot on social media and wrote: “We heard devastating news yesterday that Paul Townend, an owner and friend to us here for many years, had lost his fight against the dreadful disease Covid-19. Our thoughts are with his wife, Geraldine, and their family at this terrible time.”Tuite expressed similar sentiments and echoed Keighley’s belief that Covid-19 had been the cause of Townend’s death. “Those of you who knew Paul will remember his passion for racing, Royal Ascot week being his favourite,” Tuite wrote. “Paul had become a good friend to my family and all my team, with their regular visits to the yard. He always made time for everybody he met.“They had a huge amount of pleasure and success last season following their horse Surrey Thunder around the UK and Europe and were looking forward to this season with their horses, Surrey Pride and Surrey Flame.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad85662b6f4b46c3b1390c30d293ea047443b910/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f8e4f31380e02c16f6f7410e025e8a13","title":"the breadwinners of barishal how women in bangladesh are starting their own businesses","story":"Women in this flood-hit area are supporting their families through small businesses backed by the British Red Cross.

I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d71d20b05f7502215e0057e08765c15c2c14cff2/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91fac71b4d7a256d09937f6d3c64f2bc","title":"destination to revisit in future win 200 pounds sawdays stay coronavirus readers tips travel","story":"Tell us about a destination full of memories for you – that you’d love to return to once the Covid-19 crisis is overFirst of all, many apologies to readers who contributed to last week’s assignment on wildlife reserves, but we’ve had to postpone its publication given the Covid-19 crisis and government warnings on social distancing and travel.

Built in the Andes at 2,430 metres above sea level around AD1450, Machu Picchu was created without wheels or animals to transport the huge stones up the mountainside. A series of 360-degree images on YouVisit’s virtual tour explore various areas of the site. The tour also includes a voiceover guide with information on the architecture, history and resident alpacas. For a bird’s-eye view, head to Air Pano for stunning interactive images, including from the summit of Machu Picchu mountain. •  Travel’s Will Coldwell accompanied the Google Trekker team when they mapped Machu Picchu in 2015On the edge of the desert where the sand ends and modern Cairo begins, the pyramids of Giza were constructed around 4,500 years ago as grand tombs for the pharaohs. With walking routes around the site, this virtual tour shows the magnificent structures from near and far. This includes two of the largest pyramids ever built – the Great Pyramid (147 metres) and the Pyramid of Khafre (136 metres) – plus the Great Sphinx to the east.See one of the world’s most visited monuments on this interactive tour, which takes travellers up to the viewing platform of the 324-metre tower – give or take 18cm, which is how much the iron contracts and expands by – depending on the ambient temperature. Additional immersive digital exhibitions explore its construction, from 1887-89, with photos of the first glamorous Parisian visitors. There are also 360-degree shots showing a helicopter’s view of the tower against the city skyline.Angkor Wat, “the city of temples”, is the largest religious monument in the world, originally built as a Hindu temple complex dedicated to the god Vishnu in the first half of the 12th century, but gradually transformed into the centre of worship for Buddhism in the latter part of the same century. This virtual tour explores several of the magical temples, including the five towers of Angkor Wat itself the pink sandstone Banteay Srei and Ta Prohm (as seen in the 2001 film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider), where nature has reclaimed the ruins. For a glimpse of the living city as it would have been in the 13th century, the Virtual Angkor project includes 360-degree video simulations created collaboratively by archaeologists, historians and CGI artists.Built as the resting place for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, this symbol of eternal love is considered one of the most beautiful buildings ever created. The 17th-century white marble “crown of palaces” in Agra, north India, combines Persian, Islamic and Indian architectural styles and took 22 years to complete. The interactive digital pathways include routes around the mausoleum itself, reflecting pool, paradise gardens and ornate red sandstone mosque. Aerial 360-degree images soar above the lotus-topped dome and minarets for a view over the Yamuna River.The prehistoric site of Stonehenge in Wiltshire dates back 5,000 years. It was originally a simple earth enclosure used for cremations, with the ring of standing stones added around 2500BC. The stones include large sarsen blocks that archaeologists believe were brought to the site from Marlborough Downs (20 miles away) and smaller bluestones from Preseli Hills in Wales, a confounding 140 miles away. The English Heritage virtual tour includes a 360-degree interactive image from the centre of the site, with pop-out videos on its excavation, conservation and design, including as a site for celestial observation.

But they had now lost their housing and would have to return home before Georgia’s presidential primary.On a press call for the not-for-profit Rock the Vote, Groce said she was grateful Georgia was one of the states that have delayed their primaries, giving her more time to figure out how to cast a ballot, but those decisions have sparked their own set of concerns.As the coronavirus outbreak spreads across America, it is wreaking havoc in an election year as Democrats pick a champion to try to oust Donald Trump from the White House.But at least 15 Democratic primaries have now been delayed because of coronavirus, essentially freezing the Democratic nominating contest – currently dominated by the former vice-president Joe Biden. While state officials scramble to find safe ways for voters to cast their ballots, voting rights advocates warn that lawmakers will have to do considerable work to ensure the pandemic does not derail the presidential election.The delayed primaries are admittedly unlikely to change the final outcome of the Democratic race, considering Biden’s significant delegate lead over his rival, the democratic socialist senator Bernie Sanders. But the country’s necessary focus on coronavirus has left Biden mostly on the sidelines as he tries to pivot to his likely match-up against Donald Trump in November. The status of the party’s summer nominating convention also appears to be up in the air, which could rob Biden of another key opportunity to make his pitch to voters to choose him over Trump.Asked last week whether the convention should be canceled, Biden said no. “I don’t think it should be called off, and I don’t think we should call off any of the elections,” the candidate told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “I think we just have to move forward. We may have to use different means and methods. There’s an awful lot of direct mail voting going on right now, which may be one of the answers.”The Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, sent a similar message this month after Ohio canceled in-person voting at the last minute over concerns about spreading coronavirus at polling places. Perez said in a statement that states should focus on expanding no-excuse absentee voting and vote by mail “instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle, when timing around the virus remains unpredictable”.Sean Eldridge, the founder of the progressive group Stand Up America, said postponing primaries was unavoidable because so many states lack appropriate voting protocols to deal with such crises. “I think every state is going to have to make that choice right now, but the problem is too many states are not prepared for this moment,” Eldridge said.Eldridge’s group drove more than 70,000 constituent calls to lawmakers urging them to include funding to expand no-excuse absentee voting and vote by mail in the $2tn coronavirus package.“None of us know how long this pandemic is going to last, and we need to make sure every single eligible voter is able to cast their ballot,” Eldridge said. “If Congress provides sufficient funding to the states, then states can put that infrastructure in place now to address the coronavirus pandemic but also to be prepared for future events that could disrupt future elections.”But experts emphasize that states will need to develop a safe in-person voting option to ensure fair elections in the months to come.Certain people, such as those who are homeless or living on a Native American reservation, may not have reliable access to mail, so an entirely mail-based election could leave them behind.“There are these communities that get already wronged by our system, and they’re already getting underresourced,” said Myrna Perez, the director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice. “Relying on the mail in that way would just bake in those existing inequalities.”Perez urged states to set rigorous sanitization standards for polling sites and ensure voters can practice social distancing while casting in-person ballots, so Americans can protect their health while voting.“We need many, many different options ready to go because we’re going to have many erse communities that need to get served, and there’s not going to be one way that is able to serve them all,” Perez said.“We all know that this pandemic has been a threat to our economy, to our health and to our democracy,” Eldridge said. “It’s important that Congress respond on all three of those fronts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0161bbba05de1f9db2321260d44ed7b1a89d18c3/0_27_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4f1bb07a5edef0896de0fe29b254f8","title":"are you cohabiting because of coronavirus share your stories","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have unexpectedly moved in together due to the coronavirus lockdown, and from partners who’ve had to remain apart As measures to restrict the spread of coronavirus force people to stay at home, couples who live separately have had to decide whether to move in together or remain apart for the duration of the measures.Because of the short notice of the lockdown announcement, others may have had to remain at a house which isn’t their usual home, or with people they don’t usually live with.We’d like to hear from those who’ve unexpectedly moved in together, or those who have decided to remain apart.Are you living with your new in-laws?

She’s a 92-year-old woman,” Mexico’s president said.Corruption was Mexico’s “plague”, Amlo insisted, “not a pensioner who deserves my full respect - whoever her son might be”.“Sometimes, because it’s my job, I have to give my hand to white-collar criminals” Amlo added. “So how could I not give it to an old lady?”Mexico’s presidency later published the letter El Chapo’s mother had sent to Amlo on March 20. I​n it ​she lamented being denied a visa to see her son in the United States​ and pleaded with Amlo – who she called her “brother in Christ” –- to help her visit. “It’s been more than five years since I’ve seen him,” she wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

The test would then be repeated at regular intervals on an accumulatively larger sample of the population, to track the pandemic’s progress.The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “Germany appears to be leading the way in the testing and we have much to learn from their approach. I’ve repeatedly called for more testing and contact tracing in the UK, and we should be looking at initiatives like this closely.”The results of the German study, organised by the government’s public health body, the Robert Koch Institute, the German Centre for Infection Research, the Institute for Virology at Berlin’s Charite hospital and blood donation services, would make it easier to decide when and where schools in the country could reopen, and which people are safe to go back to work.“Those who are immune could be issued with a kind of vaccination pass that would for example allow them to exempted from restrictions on their activity,” said Gerard Krause, head of epidemiology at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig. The German government has not yet officially commented on the proposal for such a certificate made by scientists.Dr Philippa Whitford, an SNP MP and former surgeon, said immunity passports could be used specifically for key workers in healthcare in the UK but would be difficult to roll out more widely across the country because of the level of administration needed.Whitford, who is also chair of the all-party parliamentary group for vaccines, said the length of time someone may have immunity after they have had Covid-19 was still largely unknown. Someone contracting Sars, which is also a coronavirus, did not have long-term immunity – potentially only up to a year after the infection.Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government’s new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group, said people who have recovered and test positive for coronavirus antibodies should no longer be infectious themselves and would be expected to have at least some immunity to the virus.He said the worse case scenario – based on what is known about immunity to coronaviruses that cause common colds – is that former patients would have only partial resistance for about three months.“It could be that this coronavirus causes a pretty robust immune response, which is durable and protective for much longer, maybe a year or even five years, but we don’t know because it’s a new virus,” he said.Immunity passports are a “reasonable provisional measure”, Openshaw said, but he stressed that people granted the passports would have to be kept under close observation to ensure they were not becoming reinfected.“In subsequent monitoring, it would be really important to determine whether those who do return to normal circulation are in fact protected,” he said.It is unclear whether the millions of antibody tests the government has ordered will be sophisticated enough to reveal the extent of a person’s immunity, rather than simply returning a positive or negative result for circulating antibodies.Concerns have been raised that wider immunity passport schemes could incentivise certain groups, such as young people who are falling into debt through lack of work, to actively contract the virus in the hope that they can return to their jobs once recovered.But Openshaw said it would be “highly inadvisable” to breach the government’s lockdown rules and intentionally risk infection.“Although there are risk factors for severity of illness and admission to intensive care, quite a high proportion who are being admitted are otherwise well and do not have those risk factors,” he said.“It would be putting your life at risk to try and catch it at the moment. It would be much better to adhere to social distancing and to wait for the vaccine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee2818deb4c2510c724abd001a1267663bebe10a/0_363_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcc12670b8f7362ff8396322e873b0b0","title":"india wracked by greatest exodus since partition due to coronavirus","story":"Millions of workers flee cities as wages evaporate, with many walking hundreds of miles homeMamta looked out at the road ahead, barely visible in the night, and a dark thought crossed her mind: what if she and her family could not make the journey back to their village? What if her four children, including her eight-year-old disabled son, Sumit, heavy in her arms, died here on the side of the road?“The road seemed endless, we had no money for food and my children just took short breaks sleeping on the ground,” she said. But gritting her teeth and pushing hunger and exhaustion away, Mamta kept on walking.It would take her six-person family almost five days on foot to make the 125-mile journey from Gurgaon, a satellite city to the capital, Delhi, to their village, Sidamai in Uttar Pradesh, as part of an exodus of millions of migrant workers and families last week unlike anything seen in India since partition.It followed the announcement last Tuesday night by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, that for the next 21 days the entire country of 1.3 billion people would be under lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Shops, factories and restaurants would all be shut and people would be confined to their homes for all but essential activities.While it was met with approval by experts and health professionals, the lockdown has already proved catastrophic for India’s millions of migrant and daily wage workers, who earn their salary hundreds or sometimes thousands of miles away from home and live a hand-to-mouth existence.With no way to earn money and feed their families for at least three weeks, millions decided last week to head back to their villages in order to survive.With trains and most buses suspended and taxis unaffordable, walking was the only option for many, and the sides of the highways were soon lined with people, bags slung over their shoulders, many with nothing but flip-flops on their feet. More than 20 migrant labourers have died over the past few days as they try to walk back home.Mamta, 35, and her husband, both workers at automobile factories in Gurgaon that were shut during the lockdown, suddenly found themselves without a salary and no way to pay their rent or to buy food.“To survive, we had to go back to my village we had no choice,” she said. She described the five days that the family walked, starting out on Wednesday evening and finally arriving in Sidamai on Sunday afternoon, as “more terrible than anything I ever could have imagined”.They had nothing to eat except a dozen puri, fried Indian bread, that she had prepared with leftover flour before they left. The children wore through their shoes and their legs swelled up, meaning they often burst into tears out of pain. The family walked through the night, only stopping for short one-hour breaks.“The only thing that kept us moving was that we had nowhere else to go,” said Mamta. “But even though we have arrived in the village we have no money for food. I don’t know how we will survive. Hunger will kill us before coronavirus does.”Fulendra Kumar is among those migrant workers still walking. He set out last week from the industrial city of Ludhiana in Punjab and has already travelled on bus and foot 750 miles over the past week to reach Bihar, but still has another 200 to go before his final destination: the village of Araria.“I worked in a snack factory in Ludhiana, but after lockdown the factory closed down and we faced starvation as we didn’t have enough money,” said Kumar, speaking as he took a rest in the city of Patna.Over the weekend, there were similar scenes of chaos at Delhi’s Anand Vihar bus station, as hundreds of thousands of migrant workers gathered in an attempt to get on one of the limited buses still running. The crush of human bodies was the antithesis of the social distancing ordered by Modi, and the police responded by beating up workers who tried to board the buses.Among them was Rama, 45, a daily wage worker who usually polishes office floors, who was attempting to get back to his home village of Gorapur in Andhra Pradesh.“My work has totally stopped so I have no money to survive and I have not eaten since yesterday, so that is why I needed to go back,” said Rama. “But I was not the only one. The bus station was full of people like me, desperate to get out, and it was like hell.The crammed mass of people at Delhi’s bus stations and widespread migration of people across states and borders over the past few days has horrified India, both in terms of the hardships foisted on the already impoverished migrant workers and because it can only worsen the spread of coronavirus.Currently there are about 1,000 known cases here, but testing remains low, and many suspect the real figure to be much higher. In a bid to stop people moving, on Sunday night the government ordered all state borders to be closed, and police began arresting those walking on the highways or who reached state borders on foot. Many migrants who did reach the Utter Pradesh border were also hosed down with a chemical solution by police.In an effort to house the tens of thousand of returning migrants, schoolhouses and government buildings have now been turned into quarantine centres across the country. But in some places the situation has turned violent.Last week, a 50-year-old shopkeeper was killed by a group of four migrant workers at Chak-Udaipur village in Jharkhand’s Palamu district. “The shopkeeper had objected to free movement by the migrant workers in the village but they turned furious and killed him,” said Palamu district’s superintendent, Ajay Linda.Migrant workers who have made it to their villages have often found they are no longer welcome. In several villages in Bihar and Jharkhand, villagers put up barricades at the entry points and hung posters, warning the migrants against entering the village before a health check.“We took this decision as outsiders’ entry to the village could put everyone’s life at risk,” said Umesh Singh, 60, a schoolteacher from the village of Baniya-Yadupur in Bihar. “This is very dangerous time and we can’t ignore this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb943d87d7f8edb1c05b0a3e30c96bf85af7dc0e/0_0_4469_2682/master/4469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d6db87935a0f2ae8ae9bcc579d195f3","title":"is the spread of coronavirus in the uk really slowing down","story":"UK data shows the number of new cases has fallen, but experts say only time will tell if this is a trendThe epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson has said changes in the rate of hospital admissions suggests the spread of Covid-19 in the UK might be slowing down.But can we be sure that is the case? And are hospital admissions the best metric to look at? To unpick this we spoke to experts about what the numbers tell us about the spread of Covid-19.Every day public health bodies in the UK report on the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19. So could this tell us about how the disease is spreading?One difficulty is that, in recent weeks, only patients in hospital with suspected Covid-19 have been routinely tested for the disease, although testing is now being rolled out to frontline NHS staff.“The only data we really have to go on at the minute is confirmed cases – there will be obviously a vast number of increased cases in the community that we simply don’t know about,” said Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton.Current UK data shows that over the past three days the number of new confirmed cases has dropped from 2,900 on 27 March to 2,400 new cases on 29 March.While Head said that could reflect the start of a slowdown in the spread of Covid-19, he urged caution. “It is too early to really say if that is an actual trend or if it is just a natural variation,” he said. “As we go through the pandemic, cases will not increase at the same rate every day, they will fluctuate a bit anyway. So a steeper incline than the day before or a more shallow incline than the day before means little unless there is a sustained change in that rate of increase.”Indeed, Head said it could be a couple of weeks before the new social distancing measures are clearly seen to have an impact on new confirmed cases because of the lag in the development of symptoms.Changing the number of people tested, or who is being offered tests, will also affect the number of reported cases.Talking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Ferguson said that the rate of increase in admissions had slowed.While Covid-19 admissions are not among the data released each day by public health bodies in the UK, it may be expected to track the number of confirmed cases since, as mentioned above, in recent weeks testing has been confined to patients in hospital.Experts say hospitalisation data gives an idea of how many serious cases there are. But, even so, such figures may also have biases, said Prof James Wood, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge, noting people may be less enthusiastic about going to hospital as the epidemic develops.Prof John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, added the lag between changes in social distancing policies and new cases or hospitalisations means that any slight slowdown in the rate of the latter would be unlikely to reflect the impact of the lockdown yet, but more probably would reflect earlier interventions. “It takes that long to feed into the system,” he said.While death figures are updated daily, there can be a delay between a death occurring and it entering official figures.And it could be several weeks before any impact of the recent lockdown measures are reflected in changes in death rates.In addition, for deaths to be attributed to Covid-19, they need to have a confirmed infection. “The figures we release are for patients who have died in hospital with a positive test result for coronavirus,” a spokesperson for NHS England told the .That, experts have said, means some deaths may not be recorded. “It is quite possible that other people are dying both in the community and in hospital – if they haven’t presented typically, maybe they haven’t had the test,” said Wood. However, Wood noted that the biases in the death rate in hospitals are more likely to be consistent over time, potentially offering a more useful way to investigate how the epidemic is playing out in the UK.From Tuesday, the Office of National Statistics will be publishing weekly data that includes deaths in the community.Since the UK’s lockdown measures came into force on 23 March, a number of measures have recorded a decrease in public movement, from air pollution figures to statistics from apps such as Citymapper.But could such figures offer a different way to measure the spread of Covid-19? One problem is that they data is only available for certain cities, and does not cover rural areas. Another is that the data may not be fine-grained enough to give a detailed picture of how people are changing their behaviour.Edmunds said his team have begun deploying other approaches to investigating people’s behaviour, by quizzing a panel of participant about their social interactions. “We are measuring people’s contacts,” he said.The idea is that by doing so, the team can track changes in how many new cases an infected person generates on average – and get an idea of how quickly coronavirus is spreading far sooner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bd1750d3b19500d278af48ecfb81ca790d20c1a/0_0_4217_2531/master/4217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f01ebb5d9a6a53d9659e328df7072b20","title":"moscow coronavirus lockdown stay indoors city","story":"Despite orders to stay indoors, in parts of city life has appeared to continue as usualMoscow woke up to a mandatory lockdown on Monday, as the 12.5 million residents of the Russian capital were told to stay indoors in order to slow the spread of coronavirus.The restrictions are some of the most severe in the city’s history, a near curfew with little precedent in peacetime. Red Square is empty, shopping malls are shuttered and downtown parks have been cordoned off, as Muscovites prepare to self-isolate for a month or longer.And yet, in Moscow’s Sokol neighbourhood, a 15-minute drive from the Kremlin, you could almost have mistaken Monday for a normal day. Dog walkers were out early and supermarkets were open for business, even if foot traffic was a bit slow.Buses were running and food deliverers in lemon-yellow jackets whizzed by on bicycles. A manager said they had made several hundred deliveries and had not been stopped yet. “It’s like a normal day,” he said. “Just a lot more orders.”Many residents did respect the ban, which was announced on Sunday evening in a blogpost by the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, but others found there was little stopping them from venturing out. Police are largely absent from the streets, at least for now.There is a sense that the chaotic rollout of this week’s lockdown will be followed by tougher enforcement, including electronic QR-codes used to track residents. In just 10 days, the capital has gone from being told the Covid-19 outbreak is under control to having a virtual curfew.Muscovites who can leave the city have fled for their countryside dachas, hoping to trade in cramped apartments for cottages and a chance to let their kids play outside. Richer Russians have reportedly sought to buy personal ventilators as they prepare at-home clinics, the Moscow Times reported last week.Meanwhile, activists are worried about the effect the ban could have on at-risk groups of people staying at home, such as older people and women and children in abusive relationships.“We don’t know when they’re going to let everyone out again, if this could be one month, two months, more,” said Alexandra Sokolova, a graphic designer who was working with local activists to bring groceries to elderly people in the area. “It’s difficult to know what to expect tomorrow. So we’re taking this chance, when we know we can still go outside, to stock up.”The authorities were right to institute a tougher regime to slow the spread of coronavirus, she said. “But that should come with provisions for people who need help.”Muscovites have been told to stay inside except to go to the shop, the pharmacy, to seek medical help, or to walk the dog – and even then need to stay within 100 metres of home. The city centre has virtually shut down as restaurants and shops have closed.On Monday, police officers in medical masks patrolled the pedestrian Nikolskaya Street, which hosted raucous fan parties during the 2018 World Cup.Russia denies the measures constitute a formal curfew, and several Moscow region police officers were rebuked after driving through a commuter area and announcing a curfew had been declared.The crackdown may have been provoked by images of Muscovites rushing out to buy last-minute flights to beach resorts, or heading to city parks to barbecue shashlik after the president, Vladimir Putin, announced a “non-working week” beginning on Saturday.On Sunday, an outdoor gym with homemade weights and exercise equipment was teeming with people, mainly men who said they had been coming to work out for years and would not stop now.The mayor’s office was outraged when staff saw news footage of Muscovites barbecuing shashlik on state television, BBC News Russian reported. In the original version of the news report, one Muscovite tells a journalist the virus “doesn’t exist”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5041439ee24a701c542d507fba41fba489857df/0_199_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5239d63f80af54aae86b311f9ec1dfc9","title":"new study sheds light on coronavirus infection mechanism","story":"Researchers at the University of Minnesota created a 3D map of the ‘spike’ protein used to latch on to cellsNew research has shed light on a crucial biological mechanism that may have helped the coronavirus to infect humans and spread rapidly around the world.A detailed analysis of the virus’s structure shows that the club-like “spikes” that it uses to establish infections latch on to human cells about four times more strongly than those on the related Sars coronavirus, which killed hundreds of people in a 2002 epidemic.The finding suggests that coronavirus particles that are inhaled through the nose or mouth have a high chance of attaching to cells in the upper respiratory tract, meaning that relatively few are needed for an infection to gain a foothold.Scientists at the University of Minnesota used X-ray crystallography to create an atomic-scale 3D map of the virus’s spike protein and its corresponding partner on human cells, known as the ACE-2 receptor.When the virus encounters a human cell, the spike proteins on its surface stick to ACE-2 receptors, if the cell possess them, and allow the virus to gain access and replicate.Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.“The 3D structure shows that compared to the virus that caused the 2002-2003 Sars outbreak, the new coronavirus has evolved new strategies to bind to its human receptor, resulting in tighter binding,” said Dr Fang Li, who led the US team. “The tight binding to the human receptor can help the virus infect human cells and spread among humans.”The map of the virus will now be used by scientists to search for potential drugs that can neutralise the virus before replication has ramped up and the infection has taken hold. “If a new antibody drug can bind to those sites on the virus more strongly and frequently than the receptor, it will block the virus out of cells, making it a potentially effective treatment for viral infections,” Li said. The same sites can be used to shape work on vaccines to prevent future infections, he added.Writing in the journal Nature, the researchers describe how they went on to compare the structure of the pandemic coronavirus with related strains found in bats and pangolins. They found that both animal strains could bind to the same human ACE-2 receptor, supporting previous work that suggests the human coronavirus came from bats either directly, or via pangolins that themselves became infected by bats. Before infecting humans, the animal strains picked up key mutations that allowed the virus to spread more easily in humans.The erging approaches to school closures may stem from the considerable uncertainty around the extent to which children are playing a role in spreading Covid-19.“It seems most plausible to me that they are being infected but are at low risk of developing disease,” said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “We know that for flu, children are important transmitters of infection, which is the basis for the flu vaccination programme directed at children, but we do not know yet how important they are as transmitters of coronavirus. So closing schools would be based on the assumption that they do make an important contribution to transmission.”Rates of various illnesses are seen to rise and fall at the start and end of school terms. School holidays were thought to have led to a plateau in the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Also advised hygiene and social distancing measures, such as hand washing and reduced physical contact, just aren’t very effective in a primary school playground setting. So there is the potential for schools to act as a local fountain of infection for the surrounding area.“Every mother and father knows that when kids go back to school they’re going to get hammered by colds and flus and sore throats,” said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.This uncertain science has to be carefully weighed against the certain disruption and cost of school closures, including taking large numbers of doctors and nurses out of the workplace, and unintended consequences such as grandparents, who are among the most vulnerable, taking on childcare and facing greater exposure.“We know that the Covid-19-causing coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, behaves very differently to its relative Sars,” said Jonathan Ball, a professor of virology at Nottingham University, who was not involved in the study. “In particular, Sars-Cov-2 efficiently infects the throat and the nose, causing mild cold-like symptoms, whereas Sars almost always replicated in the lungs.“This study provides an attractive reason for this difference: the Sars-CoV-2 surface spike protein is able to bind more efficiently to the cell-surface protein, called ACE-2, which acts as the doorway for these viruses to enter into the cell. This improved binding might allow the virus to infect the nose and the throat more efficiently, where the levels of ACE-2 are thought to be lower.”“The study only used fragments of the virus spike and host ACE-2 protein, and this is still only a theory,” he added. “The exact implications will need validation through further experimentation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e6f61443fcdadfc94cde68f83e760b6ef89992c/0_118_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c86f3a180a764006ede145fcccac717","title":"paris lockdown leaves streets stuck 1942 abandoned film set","story":"Two locations frozen in period of Nazi occupation after coronavirus interrupts filmingResidents confined to their homes in a corner of northern Paris have been plunged back to one of the darkest moments of the city’s past.Two streets – Rue Berthe and Rue Androuet – in Montmartre in the shadow of the Sacré-Coeur basilica have been left in a timewarp of the Nazi occupation after they were returned to 1942 for a film set.The film-makers were forced to abandon the set when France went into coronavirus lockdown, leaving the streets with fake facades for corset shops, tailors, a shoe repairer and mirror-maker, and dotted with war propaganda, anti-communist tracts and signs in German.The film, Adieu Monsieur Haffmann, directed by Fred Cavayé, is an adaptation of an award-winning play telling the story of Joseph Haffmann, a Jewish jeweller in Paris at the start of the war who is forced to hide in the cellar of his shop as the Nazis take over the city.Described as a black comedy, the film stars Daniel Auteuil, who despite dozens of international films to his name including 1999’s The Lost Son, is still best remembered for his role in the 1980s films Jean de Florette with Gérard Depardieu and Manon des Sources, with Emmanuelle Béart. The film is due out next year and the set was supposed to have been dismantled last weekend.Instead, it provides an eerie reminder of a bygone era when the streets were similarly deserted by many in fear of the German occupiers. A sign in the window of the fake pharmacy: “Dear customers, because of a lack of deliveries certain articles are out of stock”, is an example of life imitating art imitating life.Paris was occupied by Nazi Germany from 14 June 1940 until 24 August 1944. The puppet French state under Marshal Philippe Pétain relocated to Vichy, while Gen Charles de Gaulle organised the Free French and Resistance forces from London. During Nazi control of the city, French police rounded up Jews who were sent to the death camps.Meanwhile, the nightclubs of Montmartre remained open, profiting from a new clientele of German officers and soldiers, while night-time brought black marketeers on to the ’ streets.Tim McInerney, a university lecturer in British and Irish cultural history in Paris and co-host of the Irish Passport podcast, tweeted: “Just in case quarantined Paris wasn’t disorientating enough: my neighbourhood was being used as a film set when the lockdown hit. Now the whole block has been left frozen in 1941”.He later said: “Paris is of course haunted by the legacy of the occupation. There’s a school down the road that has a plaque telling you how many Jewish children were deported.He said parts of the film set had been pillaged and ripped down by souvenir hunters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85d8d08f4b246a3b32ef41a3fad6ce0ab7cf49bc/93_15_1789_1075/master/1789.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ffedda1f470daf8dac8a29885b59cb4","title":"photography then and now berlin before and during coronavirus","story":"Photographs taken in Berlin before and since the coronavirus outbreak began reveal an increasingly familiar emptying of urban social spacesby Photographs by Fabrizio BenschReutersThe number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Germany has risen to 57,298 and 455 people have died of the disease here, statistics from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Monday.Germany has been testing around 120,000 people a week, according to NPR, which is partly why this daily rise in confirmed cases is so high.

McGarry, who has worked for the zoo for 34 years, can go an entire day without seeing someone since a UK-wide lockdown forced non-essential businesses to close.Though zoos across the country are unusually quiet, zookeepers are faced with the challenge of ensuring life goes on as normal for the animals they care for amid a pandemic that has profoundly altered British society.At Marwell zoo, based in Winchester, some staff have moved into empty cottages on site to continue caring for the animals. Ian Goodwin, the animal collection manager, said: “If they are people who live together in a house out of the zoo, we’ve brought some of them into the cottages that are empty.”He said staff who lived on site or those who came in were rigorously following social distancing guidelines. “They have their tea and dinner breaks at different times and they go home at different times. The animals are still getting their care they need throughout the day, we’re just limited to how many keepers we have on site or at the same time.” At Twycross zoo in Leicestershire, staff have moved to live on site, while London zoo has repurposed its visitor lodges into temporary accommodation for essential staff. Keepers in London have also been giving extra attention to the pygmy goats, who have been “waiting patiently for visitors who never turn up”.Derek Grove, the director at Dudley zoo, said keepers who could not live on site had gone to great lengths to ensure there were not any significant changes to the animals’ routines. “We’ve got orangutans and chimpanzees and they do get used to people and the way you work around them, the routine that you have. As soon as you start changing things, animals aren’t particularly pleased about it.”Others have been keen to minimise the impact they can have on other people and animals. At London zoo, staff have been car sharing and cycling to work to reduce movement across the city, while zookeepers who work closely with animals are wearing face masks and gloves when preparing their food or entering enclosures.But zookeepers are limited by the fact they are not classed as key workers, according to Gary Batters, the director of Banham zoo in Norfolk and African Alive in Suffolk. “Unlike a factory and many other businesses that shut down and walk away, we do need to have a team of people working continuously to make sure our animals are well cared for,” Batters said. “We have issues with childcare where that makes it quite difficult for our teams to come in because they have other obligations at home.”Zoos across the country warn they face a financial crisis as a result of being forced to shut to the public, with many launching fundraising campaigns to help them continue caring for the animals.McGarry said zoos faced a similar crisis 20 years ago when the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak forced them to shut for nearly two months, but he believes the coronavirus could have a more significant impact. “This is so different because there’s always a chance that staff could start to go off sick with the virus,” he said.While the “eerie” silence during the day has been peaceful, McGarry is looking forward to opening the zoo to the public again. “The chimpanzees start to wonder why there’s nobody wandering around and they go to the window to look for people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/378d1232098502f2cb46a9da341cff85407f3187/23_0_4302_2582/master/4302.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20a1a3214bb53aaa29bc6365aca84351","title":"tp captain corona","story":"President accused of cynically and criminally putting business interests over public safetySome of the most distinguished members of the Brazilian left have demanded Jair Bolsonaro’s resignation in a biting declaration that criticised what they called his cynical and criminally irresponsible handling of the coronavirus crisis.Brazil’s far-right president has enraged large sections of society in recent days by downplaying the virus and wilfully undermining efforts to slow its advance with shutdowns and quarantines.On Sunday Bolsonaro ignored his own health minister’s call for physical distancing and hit the streets of Brazil’s capital, declaring: “We’ll all die one day.”In a manifesto published on Monday morning, some of Bolsonaro’s most prominent political opponents said lives would be lost because of such behaviour.They added: “Bolsonaro is in no position to keep governing Brazil … He commits crimes … lies and fosters chaos, taking advantage of the despair of our most vulnerable citizens.“We need unity and understanding to face up to the pandemic, not a president who goes against public health authorities and puts his authoritarian political interests above the lives of everyone else.“Bolsonaro is more than a political problem – he has become a public health problem … He should resign,” they concluded.“He needs to be urgently contained and must answer for the crimes he is committing against our people.”The declaration, Brazil Cannot Be Destroyed By Bolsonaro, was signed by leading voices from across the Brazilian left including Ciro Gomes, Flávio Dino, Manuela d’Ávila, Fernando Haddad and Guilherme Boulos.Ciro Gomes said Bolsonaro’s conduct represented “the difference between hundreds of thousands of deaths or tens of thousands of deaths in Brazil”.“I believe he must answer for crimes against humanity at the International Court of Justice in the Hague – and I will work towards this,” Gomes told the .Asked what his message to Bolsonaro was, Gomes said: “Resign, you reckless man.”Boulos said the irresponsible, erratic and backwards behaviour of Bolsonaro – who one Brazilian commentator this week nicknamed “Captain Corona” – meant he had to go.“More than a political crisis, Bolsonaro now represents a public health problem,” Boulos told the . “We see no way for Bolsonaro to continue governing the country – this will cost Brazil a tremendous number of human lives.”Boulos claimed Bolsonaro’s undermining of quarantine and social distancing measures was partly the result of his being beholden to business owners who opposed a shutdown because it meant they would lose money.“He represents the most perverse economic interests that couldn’t care less about people’s lives. They’re worried about maintaining their profitability,” Boulos said.Bolsonaro has rejected criticism of his response, which he claims is designed to protect workers and the economy. “We’re going to tackle the virus but tackle it like fucking men – not like kids,” Brazil’s president declared on Sunday.Haddad, who lost to Bolsonaro in the second round of the 2018 election, said the pronouncement showed Brazilian progressives were uniting against the president’s threat. “Enough insanity,” he tweeted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efc8525cda95d0af3cc871d2944d8d0c47b30f69/0_128_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8276ca6eeca683ee3f13be9acbcfef94","title":"uk firm wont pay higher sick pay as covid 19 less severe than flu","story":"GMB union slams outsourcer Amey for only offering refuse collectors contractual minimumA senior executive at one of Britain’s biggest outsourcing companies has told workers he believes coronavirus is “less severe” than normal influenza in a message explaining why they will not receive any special sickness benefits.The claim was described as “shocking” by the GMB trade union, which was negotiating for better sick pay on behalf of refuse collectors in the London borough of Ealing, where the company has the waste contract.

To this end, we are applying exactly the same rules regarding sickness benefit as we would for any other condition in that we will be paying contractual entitlement.”Schumann-Davies acknowledged that concerns raised by workers about the outbreak were “obvious and understandable”, adding: “This is clearly a situation that none of us have had to face before and it would be fair to say that we are all learning as we go along.”The GMB replied that Amey’s stance meant workers would have to choose between “health or wealth”, because those who need to self-isolate would not be able to afford to do so if they only receive statutory sick pay.Keith Williams, the GMB organiser for London, replied to Schumann-Davies that the offer was “alarming” and out of step with employers of other workers similarly designated as key workers by government.“People do not have to self isolate for the greater good for influenza,” Williams told him in the message. “Self-isolating is the key message of the government and the country is in lock down to stop the spread of the virus.“Amey employees cannot lock themselves away as they are key workers, and therefore they are at greater risk ... if people only receive statutory sick pay they are unable to afford to self isolate … There needs to be decency and morality on the part of employers in the current crisis.”A spokesperson for Amey distanced the firm from Schumann-Davies’ position on the threat posed by the outbreak.“The email referred to does not reflect Amey’s official position on Covid-19,” they said. “We are resolutely committed to the safety of our employees and the communities we serve, and we can confirm we provide contractual sick pay from day one for any Covid-19 related illness. We are working closely with our clients and mobilising all resources required to protect our employees and prioritise work that supports the government in limiting the spread of Covid-19.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da913b2484b2a709c5e69a22a8b455b50c4cb332/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca0ccfa5250782a940b1ad8618c00710","title":"antarctica what it means when the coldest place on earth records an unprecedented heatwave","story":"Antarctica’s weather has worldwide impacts and can be a ‘canary in the mine’ for patterns of change elsewhereWhile the world rightfully focuses on the Covid-19 pandemic, the planet is still warming. This summer’s Antarctic weather, as elsewhere in the world, was unprecedented in the observed record.Our research, published today in Global Change Biology, describes the recent heatwave in Antarctica. Beginning in late spring east of the Antarctic Peninsula, it circumnavigated the continent over the next four months. Some of our team spent the summer in Antarctica observing these temperatures and the effect on natural systems, witnessing the heatwave first hand.Antarctica may be isolated from the rest of the continents by the Southern Ocean, but has worldwide impacts. It drives the global ocean conveyor belt, a constant system of deep-ocean circulation which transfers oceanic heat around the planet, and its melting ice sheet adds to global sea level rise.Antarctica represents the simple, extreme end of conditions for life. It can be seen as a “canary in the mine”, demonstrating patterns of change we can expect to see elsewhere.This summer, Casey Research Station, in the Windmill Islands oasis, experienced its first recorded heatwave. For three days, minimum temperatures exceeded zero and daily maximums were all above 7.5C. On 24 January, its highest maximum of 9.2C was recorded, almost 7C above Casey’s 30-year mean for the month.The arrival of warm, moist air during this weather event brought rain to Davis Research Station in the normally frigid, ice-free desert of the Vestfold Hills. The warm conditions triggered extensive meltwater pools and surface streams on local glaciers. These, together with melting snowbanks, contributed to high-flowing rivers and flooding lakes.The pace of warming from global climate change has been generally slower in East Antarctica compared with West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula. This is in part due to the ozone hole, which has occurred in spring over Antarctica since the late 1970s.The hole has tended to strengthen jet stream winds over the Southern Ocean, promoting a generally more “positive” state of the Southern Annular Mode in summer. This means the Southern Ocean’s westerly wind belt has tended to stay close to Antarctica at that time of year creating a seasonal “shield”, reducing the transfer of warm air from the Earth’s temperate regions to Antarctica.But during the spring of 2019 a strong warming of the stratosphere over Antarctica significantly reduced the size of the ozone hole. This helped to support a more “negative” state of the Southern Annular Mode and weakened the shield.Other factors in late 2019 may have also helped to warm Antarctica. The Indian Ocean Dipole was in a strong “positive” state due to a late retreat of the Indian monsoon. This meant that water in the western Indian Ocean was warmer than normal. Air rising from this and other warm ocean patches in the Pacific Ocean provided energy sources that altered the path of weather systems and helped to disturb and warm the stratosphere.Localised flooding appeared to benefit some of Vestfold Hills’ moss banks that were previously very drought-stressed. Prior to the flood event, most mosses were grey and moribund, but a month later many moss shoots were green.Given the generally cold conditions of Antarctica, the warmth may have benefited the flora (mosses, lichens and two vascular plants) and microbes and invertebrates, but only where liquid water formed. Areas in the Vestfold Hills away from the flooding became more drought-stressed over the summer.High temperatures may have caused heat stress in some organisms. Antarctic mosses and lichens are often dark in colour, allowing sunlight to be absorbed to create warm microclimates. This is a great strategy when temperatures are just above freezing, but heat stress can occur once 10C is exceeded.Based on our experience from previous anomalous hot Antarctic summers, we can expect many biological impacts, positive and negative, in coming years. The most recent event highlights the connectedness of our climate systems: from the surface to the stratosphere, and from the monsoon tropics to the southernmost continent.Under climate change, extreme events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, and Antarctica is not immune."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2703eda6c4eb79ac8c11ea9b07ca2183","title":"postcards from the pandemic losing a business and a life purpose","story":"‘If I’m not here, I’m a mess’: Kristy Busuttil runs a taekwondo studio in Melbourne. Coronavirus has just forced her to close its doorsPostcards from the pandemic is a new series that looks at how everyday Australians are coping with immense changes coronavirus has brought to their lives.Kristy Busuttil is a strong person. A Commonwealth gold medallist in the Korean martial art of taekwondo, compact and super-fit, a black belt since she was 14 years old.She’s a vulnerable person, too. On Monday 23 March, after further restrictions were announced that would ban businesses like hers, she closed Jeongsin Taekwondo, the club she opened 15 years ago. “This is an extremely hard message to write and I had been hoping it would never come,” she wrote on her Facebook page. “I am so sorry.”Today, she sits barefoot on a chair in her empty studio, a shopfront in a modest strip in Maidstone in inner Melbourne. It’s a long grey room with mirrors along one side, the roof a little saggy, the paint a little worn. Korean characters are framed on the wall to recognise fives aspects of the martial way: respect, discipline, spirit, humility and honour.Busuttil, 36, is married with three children. She is dealing with urgent practical challenges, and more emotional ones.“Financially – sorry, I’m going to get upset – I’ve still got a lease. I’ve got water, electricity, I’ve got insurance. I’ve got everything to pay. But I’ve got no income, because we can’t run classes because nobody’s allowed to come near each other any more.”She estimates her outgoing costs are about $4,000 a month, including $2,000 to lease the studio. She hasn’t asked the landlord for a discount, because “she would say she’s probably in the same boat”. She spent the morning trying to apply through Centrelink for what she might be entitled to. She and her husband, Matt, are working out if their mortgage can be frozen.The emotional challenges are more complex, the downside of the hope and passion built into many small businesses. Busuttil grew up in Melbourne’s western suburbs, the child of parents who ran a cleaning business.The local newspaper called the then Kristy Johnson the “golden girl”, with a suite of state and national championships, and a gold and bronze medal in taekwondo at the Commonwealth Games in 2006.She retired from competition, setting up her club in the western suburbs because that’s where she came from. She wanted a local, family-friendly place, and now has 170 students, aged three to 63.Before coronavirus upended everything, each day Busuttil would deliver Logan, eight, to school and Scarlet, four, to kinder, then look after 18-month-old Owen before doing the school pickup. Her parents, Gary and Christine Johnson, would then mind the kids two afternoons a week and Matt would do evening shifts so she could open the club from 4.30pm to 8.30pm.Now she is home-schooling the older two. They do maths, writing and art, and she gets them into the garden. It’s going well, she says, but her voice wavers. “My son, we recently found out, is on the spectrum. Trying to keep some normality for him is really important, because otherwise he will have meltdowns.”Her dad Gary Johnson, 65, has been in isolation at his home in Point Cook for weeks. “We had to lock him up straightaway because he’s got no spleen. He’s immunocompromised anyway. He has a rare blood disorder, so he has to have an injection for that. He’s also had a quadruple bypass. He’s had a kidney transplant. He’s diabetic, has high blood pressure. He has the works. If he goes out and catches this, that would be the end of him, and we know that that’s for sure.” Christine, 61, has been FaceTiming her grandchildren. “The kids keep asking when Nanna and Pa will come see them.”Busuttil hopes she can hang on for six months and reopen, even if it’s gradual with social distancing rules in place. For now, Matt, who works for a health information company, is working from home, so there is some money coming in.Most nights, Busuttil still drives to the club in the dark. She has set up a tripod at the back of the room and, dressed in her martial arts uniform – the white dobok – she conducts Facebook classes for her students, just basic, foundational moves. She isn’t charging for them for now, but says if this goes on for months, she will need to ask for something, perhaps less than half of her normal fee. She needs to be here, anyway.“When you go from working and being focused on a goal and a dream, then all of a sudden it’s taken away from you, it’s very scary.”We’d like to hear your story about how you are managing during this crisis.

On March 27th, the Department of Public Expenditure issued overall guidelines to the public service. These indicated that where there were limited opportunities for remote working in an employee’s current role, organisations should seek to identify any staff suitable to be redeployed under the Government’s temporary assignment scheme to apply during the coronavirus pandemic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe Government should consider closing the country’s borders to prevent new coronavirus infections coming into the State, one of the leading infectious diseases experts has said.Dr Paddy Mallon, a consultant at St Vincent’s University Hospital in Dublin and professor of microbial diseases at UCD, said a major risk to the State was more new Covid-19 infections coming in.“We have got our own outbreak in the country that we are trying to extinguish but the big threat is new infections coming in,” he said.“We should be looking seriously over the next week at protecting our borders and stopping new infections coming in because it will give us the ability to control the infections that we have.”The warning comes as the Health Service Executive said it was “impossible to predict” the timing of the peak of infections but it was planning for the worst of the crisis to hit by mid-April.Prof Sam McConkey of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland called for political leadership to build a “unity government that helps us beat the virus in the next few months” in order to fast-track debate on possible stricter travel and quarantine rules and tracing technology for iniduals.“In a political system that is used to slow deliberation, it will not be an easy task to achieve an agreed outcome in a few days,” Prof McConkey writes in an opinion piece in Monday’s .Ages of deadState officials reported another 10 deaths from coronavirus, bringing the death toll from the disease in the Republic to 46. There were a further 200 cases confirmed, bring the total to 2,615.A further six deaths and 86 new cases were reported in Northern Ireland, bringing the total number of deaths on the island of Ireland to 67 and cases to 3,025.Details of the ages of the first 33 people to die from coronavirus in the Republic were disclosed in official figures over the weekend. Some 29 of the dead – as of March 26th – were over the age of 65, while one person died from each of the 25-34, 35-44, 45-54 and 55-64 age groups.The number of critically ill Covid-19 patients in intensive care units (ICU) was more evenly spread, with the youngest aged between five and 14. Thirty-three were aged between 45 and 64, and 24 people were over 65.The HSE said it was preparing for a surge of coronavirus cases with 1,200 critical care beds, but could not say by how much the State’s ICU capacity would be exceeded at peak.ICU concernsSome 88 Covid-19-infected patients were in ICU on Saturday and there were 167 ICU beds still available, as the HSE scales up the number of critical care beds with life-saving ventilators.Paul Reid, chief executive of the HSE, said given the surge in critically ill Covid-19 patients needing ICU beds – almost a sevenfold increase in over nine days – the possibility of the State’s ICU bed capacity being reached in just more than two weeks was “a very significant concern”.Health officials warned the public that complying with the Government’s “cocooning” direction for the over-70s and the medically vulnerable to stay at home for two weeks was “critical” to avoid ICU units being overrun by mid-April. Such compliance was also critical to avoid those at greatest risk of death being infected.The first shipment of vitally needed personal protective equipment, part of a €28 million order, arrived on an Aer Lingus flight from China on Sunday afternoon.However, new issues emerged with testing for Covid-19 as Mr Reid said the State was “hitting very significant pinch points” in carrying out tests, due to the shortage of reagents, the extraction element used in test kits that go to laboratories.A lack of testing kits led to the closure of the State’s largest testing facility at the Páirc uí Chaoimh GAA ground in Cork. The HSE said there had been “limited testing nationally” on Sunday due to the short supply of testing materials.More than 15,000 people are still waiting to be tested.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Holohan warns on complacency as Higgins urges us to keep giving \u0026lsquoof our best\u0026rsquoHealth specialist says Ireland \u0026lsquosquandering\u0026rsquo its geographical advantage as an island with different virus approaches North and SouthClancy family call for greater support for nursing homes as father contracts Covid-19Opinion in Green Party said to be split between those open to FF-FG talks and those opposedRight now, remdesivir is the most promising one in tackling the virus head-onFears expressed that court-issued safety orders will be harder to accessOlder people seen out in shops, believing they are exception to stay at home messageUncertainty around date of European Bridge League team championships in MadeiraLisa Chambers and FG councillor John McGahon set to be elected to SeanadBuilder says work at Intel in Co Kildare not critical and would ceaseStocks expected to be fully replenished by Tuesday while laboratories also lack reagentDepartment of Environment rejects plan for Dr Maurice Manning to virtually superviseAer Lingus flight EI9018 from Dublin to Beijing forced to return after a bird strikeWe are beginning to see encouraging signs in our efforts to flatten the curve - Holohan\u0026lsquoWe are not travelling through the darkness alone, but that we are on this journey together\u0026rsquoCompany to run freight-only services to Ireland if staff depleted due to impact of virusHSE issues new guidance on use of masks for close patient encounters and staff meetingsUp to 389,000 apply for \u0026euro350 Covid-19 benefit, equivalent to a 19-month claim loadDirectors take 50 per cent pay cut amid layoffs resulting from coronavirus outbreakNorthern Ireland\u0026rsquos Executive demonstrating \u0026lsquocommon purpose\u0026rsquo, say political leadersStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4216181.1585595889!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"backers of labour leadership contender kelly split over entering government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Duncan Smith: “I don’t think at this point we should go into government, and it doesn’t change the mandate we got in February.” Photograph: Alan Betson Duncan Smith, the recently elected Dublin Fingal TD who helped launch Mr Kelly’s leadership campaign, said he believes Labour should go into opposition. His view contradicts that of Cork East TD Seán Sherlock, another supporter of Mr Kelly, who said Labour should consider entering government.Mr Smith said: “We will do everything we can in the context of Covid-19 to tackle this crisis, but I don’t think at this point we should go into government, and it doesn’t change the mandate we got in February.”Mr Kelly, who earlier in the leadership contest with Aodhán Ó Ríordáin said Labour should go into opposition, did not return calls.Mr Ó Ríordáin said he would not lead Labour into government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, but that the party would play its part in helping the country through the coronavirus crisis.The party has six TDs, having lost a seat in February’s general election.The political focus has shifted to Labour as the conclusion of its leadership contest approaches later this week.The Green Party, which has 12 Dáil seats, has called for a national unity government. It is understood its TDs will again discuss this week its government talks strategy if its unity government proposal fails.Some, such as leader Eamon Ryan, are understood to be open to talks with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, while others are opposed. Opinion between the two options is said to be roughly evenly ided in the Greens.Tánaiste Simon Coveney has also spoken to Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall in recent days.Between them Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have 72 seats, eight short of a majority. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Monday said he hoped that a “common framework document which would sketch out how a government might work” could be agreed between the two parties by next week.“Independents…wouldn’t be enough, so we will need a third party. So the idea then if we can agree a common framework document is to reach out to Greens, Social Democrats and Labour,” he said.Smaller partiesFinian McGrath, the outgoing Minister of State for Disability Issues who attends Cabinet, criticised smaller parties, in particular the Social Democrats, for their approach to entering government.The former Dublin Bay North TD, who did not stand at the general election but will remain a Minister until a new government is formed, said the Sláintercare plan to expand public healthcare favoured by the Social Democrats was being implemented as a result of the coronavirus crisis.“They have a golden opportunity to bring about their major policy, but the SocDems are missing in action at a time of national crisis.”A spokeswoman for the Social Democrats said: “We have been very proactive in supporting the Government during this health crisis.

The local pub in Castleplunkett, Co Roscommon has been a lifeline for Tony Brophy since his wife died six months ago. The 63-year-old usually calls into Dec’s Bar in the village three or four nights a week, often just for a cup of tea or coffee.Though supportive of closing pubs as a virus containment measure, announced on March 15th, Brophy has been cut off from the familiar faces he meets in Dec’s. He is home alone and self-isolating to avoid contracting Covid-19.“I was bad enough up to this. I lost my wife six months ago and I’m living on my own. It’s a terrible situation now that I can’t meet people,” said Brophy.“There’s an awful lot of people in that situation and it’s going to have an awful effect on them psychologically.”Padraig Morris, who lives outside Castlerea, Co Roscommon, is also feeling the impact. The 45-year-old farmer usually visits one of Ballinlough’s pubs two or three nights a week, often to play card games. The venues offer a feeling of community, he says, that will be sorely missed during this crisis. “There would be a feeling of isolation. It’s going to be hard on a lot of people, especially older people. For them, it’s their social outlet - they have nowhere else to go,” he says. An eye outWhile a very small minority of pubs have operated clandestinely despite the closure order, some that are following the rules have been keeping an eye out for their regulars. Lorna McGourty, who runs McGourty’s in Castlerea, said one of her staff has been checking in with some of the pub’s older patrons by phone during the crisis as the customers are “like family”.“Some of them would be single elderly men who will be sitting at home now, and they’re just not used to it,” said said. “We will try to reassure them that we’re here if they need anything. We have an obligation to them and we do care.”Damien Garvey, whose parents Tom and Bonnie run Garvey’s in Ballintubber, Co Roscommon, said many of their customers would be “well into retirement”. “It’s going to be hard on them for the next couple of weeks, but all we can do is keep an eye on them,” he said. “I’m a plumber down here as well so I’ll be around the town and the village a bit with calls and that and will keep an eye out for them. That’s all you can do.”Roscommon councillor Nigel Dineen said rural communities are pulling together to make sure people missing their visit to the pub are not left entirely without community engagement.“People have set up WhatsApp groups and different groups to make sure that nobody is not being spoken to, rang, texted,” he said.“Isolation is a tough thing if you’re on your own...especially if you’re used to going out to a pub to meet people. When that’s taken away from you, it needs to be substituted with a call or a text.”HaltedWhile customers are losing out on interaction, the publicans themselves have seen their trade completely halted. Industry lobby groups have long pointed out that some 1,500 pubs have closed in the State since 2006, with around 7,000 bars in operation in 2018. Some publicans fear the current closures could see the number drop further, in rural areas particularly, with many possibly not reopening if the measures remain in place for a prolonged period. “It might actually change the whole culture in Ireland of people socialising,” said McGourty. “It’s hard to see how the small rural publican might survive.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4216193.1585597199!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"quinn industrial holdings lays off 600 staff temporarily","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tQuinn Industrial Holdings’ offices in Derrylin, Co Fermanagh.

Employees at Quinn Packaging – which supplies packaging to the food sector and is therefore deemed an essential business – and a small number of employees who are able to work from home are unaffected.QIH, which manufactures building products and consumer packaging, employs about 830 people in Ballyconnell, Co Cavan, and Derrylin, Co Fermanagh.In a statement, a company spokesman said that following the announcements by the Irish and British governments last week of new restrictions designed to slow the spread of coronavirus, QIH had “closed andor substantially scaled back all operations that require physical attendance at work and which were not included in the published list of essential business”.Temporary layoffsAs a result, the spokesman said, about 600 staff would be “furloughed or placed on temporary layoff and paid in accordance with the relevant Government support scheme applicable to their roles”.“QIH recognises this is a very challenging disruption for staff and their families but it is necessary and unavoidable if we are to protect one another from this global pandemic and safeguard the lives of the most vulnerable in our community,” the spokesman said.Last year one of QIH’s directors, Kevin Lunney, was abducted and left with life-changing injuries as part of an ongoing campaign of violence and threats against the company’s executives.

Photograph: John McVitty Retired Fermanagh civil servant Tom Best last saw his wife of 51 years alive when she was being placed in an ambulance and driven away from the couple’s Derrylin, Co Fermanagh, home last Wednesday afternoon.Seventy-two-year-old Anne began to complain of severe pains last Monday. Given the arrival of Covid-19, and her underlying medical conditions, the couple’s doctor, Michelle McBrien quickly called an ambulance.Within 24 hours, her condition worsened and she died in Enniskillen’s South West Acute Hospital without seeing her husband again. Anne Best was the first person to die of Covid-19 in the county.Typically, Fermanagh’s funerals are like those elsewhere on the island, where the bereaved enjoy neighbours’ support as they cope with loss. Today, that is no longer possible. Covid-19 has changed the way people live and die.On Saturday, Anne was buried at St Ninnidh’s cemetery in Derrylin, again without her husband watching over her. He has been told to self-isolate at home for 14 days, unable to say farewell to his soulmate.Under a bright blue sky, there was no funeral. A handful of mourners watched from afar as the coffin with a single white rose was lowered by gloved gravediggers. Parish priest Gerard Alwill read prayers. Undertaker Pat Blake stood nearby.‘Take notice’“It’s breaking my heart, it’s just breaking my heart that I couldn’t be there when she died, or at the funeral,” an emotional Tom told the Impartial Reporter newspaper, in an interview he wanted to do “to make people take notice”.Clutching a photograph of his wife, Tom paced up and down his garden, a short distance from where his wife was being laid to rest. It was all that he could do.“I am not going to break all the rules and walk up there and see her. I’m not going to do that because that would not be right it would be selfish on all the people of Derrylin,” he said.Recalling how his wife had begun to feel unwell, Tom said: “She said ‘I feel awful, awful sick’. There was a lot of moaning . . . if you could hear someone groaning and moaning. And she could take pain,” he said.Because he was unable to leave his home and due to hospital restrictions, Tom could not be by his wife’s side. Later, he received the heartbreaking call from a hospital doctor telling him of his wife’s death.‘Fall apart’“I got a call on the Wednesday night explaining that things were not looking good. I’ve been around a lot of death over the years and I can put two and two together. When it comes to your own door, you just fall apart and that is a fact.“I told the doctor whatever you are doing, you are doing your best. Then he said the next call will be the one to tell me she was gone. ‘You can be expecting it’ he said,” explained Tom. That call duly came.With tears rolling down his face, he struggled with loss remembering some little things they enjoyed together – a favourite TV crime series or his habit of making her breakfast each morning. From now, he will be in the house alone.“What impact has it had on me since she died? That’s the big...you know, I don’t know what I can do. The last time I saw her was when she was being put into the ambulance and looking down and that’s it.“It’s heartbreaking, it’s heartbreaking. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone, that is a fact. Maybe some good will come out of it. It is unimaginable, I don’t think we have ever faced anything like this in our time, in my 77 years anyhow.“You might wonder why I wanted to cook her breakfast and do things for her,” he said, folding the photograph of the couple’s wedding day in Gibraltar in 1969 and placing it back into his pocket.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Officers accused of acting like \u0026#39police state\u0026#39 over lockdown rules Food vouchers go out to youngsters from low-income families during coronavirus crisisUS coronavirus death toll surpasses number killed in 911 attacksWhen will coronavirus peak in the UK?  How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?

Their service currently remains the same.Hull City Council said that they have trained up to 45 additional staff members to provide waste collection services but this means that other services will see a reduction including stopping the collection of bulky items.  Meanwhile, with increased numbers of people at home, Durham County Council pleaded with members of the public to “park appropriately and leave access for bin crews to get lorries into estates and down small roads”.People who are self-isolating are also being urged to place waste and recycling in double-bagged plastic bags and not to put their waste out for 72 hours after it has been bagged up.But the change in collections, as well as the widespread closures of waste and recycling centres, may lead to increased fly tipping - as people turn to gardening and DIY during the lockdown.The Local Government Association admitted that councils had seen an “increase in residual waste” due to several reasons, including people following the guidance to stay at home but said that fly tipping is “never acceptable”.An LGA spokesperson said: “As coronavirus impacts on the safety of their workforce handling waste, some councils have had to temporarily suspend or reduce the frequency of some kerbside collections, and some council household waste and recycling centres have had to impose restrictions or close in some areas.  “Residents can definitely play a role by reducing waste and following advice from councils if waste and recycling services are subject to temporary changes. Fly-tipping is never acceptable and services will be restored once it is safe to do. They added that councils will “continue to work hard to keep waste and recycling services working as effectively as possible and to ensure the safety of the workforces delivering this key public service.”Allison Ogden-Newton OBE, Chief Executive of environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy urged people to take personal responsibility for their waste and rubbish as local councils face “significant challenges”.She said: “The message to the public is a simple one, keep hold of your waste until it can be disposed of properly and legally.”Ms Ogden-Newton went on to warn against fly tipping: “We are facing enough challenges as a country at the moment and when we are finally able to go out and enjoy our environment again we do not want to be faced with a country covered with even more fly-tipping.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"four graphs government says show lockdown working","story":"The coronavirus epidemic in the UK appears to be slowing down, with the rise in new cases falling for three days in a row, latest figures show, as social distancing measures start to work.Since Tuesday 24 March, the first full day of the nationwide lockdown, the number of confirmed cases rose between 21 per cent and 37 per cent per day. But cases fell roughly 17 per cent on Saturday, 14 per cent on Sunday and 13 per cent on Monday.Graphs released by the Government following its daily press briefing also showed how social distancing has been hugely effective, with journeys by commuter train, bus and national rail falling to below 25 per cent.Daily cases peaked at 2,885 on Friday and have been falling ever since. Presenting the latest data, Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser, said: The measures are in place, they are making a difference, they are decreasing the contact, which is so important to spread the disease, and we\u0027re doing a good job at cutting that down.We expect that measures that are in place that cause that social distancing, the stay-at-home message will be reducing the number of cases of transmission in the community and decreasing the number of cases overall.We would expect this, in turn, to decrease the number of people needing admission to hospital.Sir Patrick also said the number of people needing hospital treatment was stabilising, even though graphs showed that figure had risen significantly in recent days. He added: The total number of people admitted to hospital since the middle of March which is now 8,000 people with coronavirus - that\u0027s gone up pretty much the same amount each day for the last few days.That shows that it\u0027s going up, not in an increasing amount but in a constant amount, which may suggest that we\u0027re already beginning to see some effect through.”Earlier, Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London, who has been pivotal to Government modelling of the outbreak, said that the epidemic appeared to be slowing down because of the social distancing measures that have been enacted.In the UK we can see some early signs of slowing in some indicators - less so deaths because deaths are lagged by a long time from when measures come in force, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.But if we look at the numbers of new hospital admissions, that does appear to be slowing down a bit now.It has not yet plateaued, so still the numbers can be increasing each day, but the rate of that increase has slowed.Prof Ferguson observed that the epidemic was spreading at different rates in different parts of the country.It is quite clear the epidemic is in different stages in different parts of the country, he said.In central London, it could be as many as 3 per cent to 5 per cent of the population has been infected - maybe more in inidual hotspots. In the country as a whole in the UK, maybe 2 per cent or 3 per cent.Based on the estimated UK population of 66 million, this would mean between 1.3 and two million people have or have had the virus.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds skiers sue austrian resort exposing coronavirus","story":"Hundreds of tourists are to take legal action against an Austrian ski resort, accusing it of knowingly exposing them to the coronavirus.An Austrian consumer affairs watchdog is pursuing a class action lawsuit against the authorities in Ischgl, a ski resort now known to be a major source of the European outbreak.Some 400 skiers have already signed up to take part, according to the Austrian Consumer Protection Association (VSV).The association accuses the authorities in Ischgl of covering up the extent of the outbreak in the resort and keeping it open despite the risk to people.“The global coronavirus pandemic qualifies as force majeure and nobody can be held responsible for any damage suffered. However, keeping ski resorts open, even though authorities knew or should have known of a threat of mass infection, is certainly a reason to consider claims for damages,” the association said in a statement.It has emerged that Ischgl remained open for a full week after Iceland warned Austria it was seeing multiple cases in skiers returning home from the resort, and  for several days after a barman at a popular venue tested positive for the virus in March.The VSV said it had filed criminal complaints against officials in Ischgl and was seeking testimony to prove “the ski resort\u0027s closure was delayed for commercial reasons”.Separately, Austrian prosecutors last week opened an investigation into allegations that a suspected infection in the resort was covered up and not reported to the authorities as early as February.The VSV has invited anyone who was at Ischgl and believes they may have a case to sign up using an interactive form on its website.Those believed to have caught the virus in Ischgl include tourists from the UK, Iceland, Germany, Sweden, Norway and Canada.

No police or military were seen to enforce the lockdown.The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Russia jumped last week to reach 1,836 on Monday, most of them recorded in the Russian capital.Sergei Sobyanin, the Moscow mayor, announced a full lockdown on Sunday, ordering residents to stay at home except for when they need to go to the nearest grocery store or walk the dog. No outdoor exercises are allowed.The mayor on Sunday thanked Muscovites for heeding his call to stay at home but added that “obviously not everyone had heard us” in an apparent reference to the families who flocked to parks and forests over the weekend to enjoy the relatively warm weather.The festive mood was not entirely unexpected after Mr Putin in his address to the nation on Wednesday asked Russians to stay at home during what he called a “holiday” week off work. It was not immediately clear how the authorities will enforce the lockdown but the Moscow government, which previously used CCTV and face recognition technology to track coronavirus patients, is expected to roll out a tracking system later this week.Just a few days earlier, Mr Putin visited Moscow’s main coronavirus hospital and insisted that the epidemic was “generally under control.”The Russian leader of 20 years, who earlier this month pushed through an amendment allowing him to stay in power, appears to be taking a back seat in dealing with the outbreak, leaving it to the Moscow mayor and the prime minister to be the bearers of bad news.Opposition leader Alexei Navalny said on Monday he was bewildered why Mr Putin, who has been hailed by state TV as someone who could save Russia in times of trouble, has not been seen in public since Thursday.It was only 20 hours after the lockdown was announced that Mr Putin made his first public appearance on Monday, chairing a conference call with his envoys in the regions.The Russian leader called for expanding testing and conducting a full inventory of hospital beds and ventilators to be prepared in advance of  a predicted jump in new cases.“It’s likely that Putin doesn’t want to be associated with the worrying situation in the country when you have to say unpleasant, worrying things,” Moscow-based political analyst Masha Lipman told The .More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"south korea step by step diary country got coronavirus control","story":"South Korea has been praised as a global leader in the fight against the coronavirus after quickly adopting an aggressive “trace, test, treat” policy.In recent days, nearly 120 countries have reached out to Seoul for advice.The country’s first case was reported on 20 January, compared with Italy’s on January 31, but the disease’s trajectory in the two nations could not look more different.South Korea has seen just 158 deaths, keeping the number of cases below 10,000. A mass testing campaign, coupled with intensive contact tracing, has allowed the infected to quickly isolate, slowing the spread of the disease to make it more manageable for hospitals.Daily life is relatively normal, in contrast to the devastating pile up of coffins in quarantined Italy, where more than 10,000 have died and infections have surpassed 100,000. Korean coronavirus test makers have started ramping up test-kit production to hundreds of thousands a day after being granted approval to export to the United States. NHS Scotland is also set to benefit from South Korean equipment that will give test results in just seven hours.Here\u0027s how South Korea\u0027s policy played out. Ben Griffin from Bradford, who teaches English in the small city of Gyeongju, experienced the efficiency of the Korean testing system, which has so far tested close to 400,000 people in a country of 51.5 million.When he arrived for a routine check-up at a hospital in the southern city of Busan he was stopped in the carpark for a temperature test and a health survey about his travel history and possible Covid-19 symptoms.His temperature was slightly above normal so he was not allowed inside, but was given the option of a test. The test is free for suspected Covid-19 cases but Mr Griffin used his health insurance to take a precautionary screening, for the cost of about £80.“Questionnaires are filled out in marquee tents outside the hospital. Then I got taken into another sealed off tent where there were people wearing hazmat suits,” he said.“It was basically just two tests – an extended cotton bud up the nose which makes your eyes water and then a thing down the throat which makes you gag a little bit but they were both done in 45 seconds,” he added“I got the test done about 4pm on the Friday and I knew by 11am on Saturday that I was negative.”Tracing is another essential part of the Korean system. Mr Griffin and his wife Cat said their phones regularly pinged with geolocated emergency alerts sent automatically by text message to indicate if someone nearby had tested positive.The alert gives details of where the patient has been in the last 72 hours, urging people who were in the same location to contact the health authorities.The alert conceals names but often gives details of age, where the patient lives or their job.“There was a case in our apartment building. We weren’t told who it was but there was an emergency alert and our security guards warned over the tannoy not to go outside,” said Mr Griffin.Hyun Park, a Korean professor who is still recovering from the disease but who described his treatment in a lengthy Facebook post, said he had been “stupidly overconfident” as he was a healthy gym fanatic who always washed his hands.Mr Park’s symptoms began with a very mild sore throat, dry cough and pressure on his chest. As his condition worsened, he called the coronavirus emergency line and the local health centre and was advised to take a test at the hospital. The result took 24 hours and was positive.An employee from the city hall called Mr Park to check recently visited areas and to list close contact.Mr Park said the city hall employee called a health centre to prioritise a transfer to hospital.I was hospitalised at the negative pressure room at the quarantined section of an intensive care unit,” he said.“They immediately took CT, blood, X-ray and many other tests and also immediately provided medicine and an oxygen supply,” he added.“I felt a better able to breathe, but like I had a heavy metal plate on my chest. My chest and stomach burned after taking the medicine.”South Korea has 10.6 intensive care beds per 100,000 compared to the UK’s 6.6, but as cases exploded in February, health facilities were initially overwhelmed, with hospitalisations peaking at over 5,000 in Daegu, the epicentre, in early March.The country turned the situation around by admitting only the most sick and elderly to hospitals, while isolating younger and asymptomatic patients in quarantine dormitories.Aggressive testing eventually curbed the spread and led to less pressure on the health system.Mr Park remained in hospital for nine days before being cleared by two negative tests.He was advised to remain in home quarantine for another two weeks and thanked “selfless” medics for their “hard and risky” work.After 25 days, he still feels short of breath after five minutes of walking, but is trying to keep his spirits up.“While there is life, there is hope,” he said.David Tizzard also contributed to this article More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uks attempt ramp coronavirus testing hindered key components","story":"Britain’s attempt to ramp up mass coronavirus testing has been dealt a blow after key components ordered from overseas were discovered to be contaminated with coronavirus, the  can disclose.Laboratories across the country were on Monday warned to expect a delay after traces of the virus were detected in parts due for delivery in the coming days.It comes as ministers and public health chiefs face growing questions over why Britain’s testing capacity appears to be lagging far behind other major nations including the US and South Korea.To accelerate production, the government has enlisted private firms to help produce thousands of kits in the hope that mass testing will be available to the public within weeks.One of the suppliers - the Luxembourg-based firm Eurofins - sent an email on Monday morning to government laboratories in the UK warning that a delivery of key components called “probes and primers” had been contaminated with coronavirus and would be delayed.The firm admitted there had been “an issue” and insisted other private providers had suffered the same problem.Exactly how the contamination occurred is not clear, and senior health sources insisted the delay would not significantly affect the UK’s testing programme.Meanwhile, Downing Street accused Public Health England of providing ministers with incorrect information on the number of coronavirus tests conducted after Michael Gove claimed that 10,000 had been completed on Sunday. Only 8,278 tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am on Sunday morning.The Prime Minister’s spokesman was yesterday forced to clarify that Mr Gove had been referring to the capacity available, rather than the actual number completed, which had been lower.It came 24 hours after Mr Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, stated the Government’s target of 10,000 tests per day had been hit, with ministers now pushing for 25,000 by mid-April. However, confusion mounted when official figures published by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) revealed that just under 7,000 people had been tested, significantly lower than Mr Gove had claimed. On Monday morning, health minister Helen Whately added to the uncertainty when she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We have achieved the capacity to have 10,000 tests a day. The actual number that was tested on the day in question was I think around 7,000.”To compound the issue further, PHE released the latest figures just minutes later, stating that between Friday morning and 9am on Saturday 9,114 tests had been completed. PHE also stated that “testing capacity for patient care stands at 10,949 a day”, prompting questions as to whether, despite overwhelming demand, health services failed to carry out the maximum number of tests available.Last night Whitehall sources claimed the error had occurred due to Public Health England failing to make clear to ministers the distinction between the capacity available and the number that had actually been completed.They added that a number of people were tested more than once, thereby resulting in the disparity between the statistics. Government sources said the discrepancy was partly caused by hospitals not knowing at the start of each day how many people would need to be tested, and holding back enough capacity to ensure they did not run out of tests.The  also understands that Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, has also privately expressed frustration that testing may not be being carried out at full capacity and has ordered any excess tests to be used on NHS staff.NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said roll-out of testing will begin this week after staff were sampled on Saturday and Sunday.On March 11 the UK announced it had carried out 25,000 tests in total and was aiming for 10,000 a day — a target it has yet to reach. Ministers are hoping that a new antibody test that discovers whether a person has previously contracted the virus will be ready within weeks.Food delivery company Ocado has ordered 100,000 Covid-19 testing kits for staff but has promised to hand them over to the NHS if required.It has paid £1.5m for the testing kits, with 40,000 already delivered and a further 60,000 to come, while celebrities have been paying up to £375 to have tests done privately.But experts yesterday questioned why Britain was lagging so far behind other nations in mass testing of the population. Professor Graham Medley, chair of SPI-M, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which advises the Government, said the country simply did not have enough “people and machines” to ramp up capacity, compared to other countries.“It’s the difference between cooking and catering,” he told the . “We might have the brilliant minds but we don’t have the machines or the number of trained people to ramp this up properly.“We are trying to do things that are beyond any single research laboratory. We need more PCR machines which are expensive and need to be maintained.“We need the people trained to run them, even though in an ideal world they might never be needed.“South Korea have got warehouses full of testing kits and machines, and lots of people trained and ready to go. When Sars and Mers came along, they knew they needed it.“Germany just appear to have been better prepared than us. It would have been a very difficult political decision to spend that kind of money on things that might never have been needed.” To increase capacity, Public Health England have enlisted an army of volunteers including university students to help laboratories, it emerged on Monday. Some will be paid for their work while others have offered their expertise for free.When the disease first emerged, the UK chose to use only one lab - Public Health England’s main facility at Colindale in north London. In recent weeks public health authorities have enlisted 11 more labs as well as universities and NHS hospitals.Greg Clark, the former Conservative business secretary who chairs the House of Commons science select committee, which is investigating the Government’s response to Covid-19, questioned why Britain had been so slow to bring in more laboratories to ramp up production.“Our strategy was to start with one lab then increase it to 12. I don’t know why we moved so slowly,” he said.“It’s not clear why we don’t have the testing capacity, and why we appear to be in a worse position than other countries on this.”Mr Clark also questioned why Public Health England only had 290 people working on contact tracing, unlike nations like South Korea where tracing infected people has been a key part of the strategy.“It just doesn’t make sense. We need to know where the disease is going,” he said.A spokesman for Eurofins said: “In rare occasions, delays in some orders may occur if based on Eurofins Genomics stringent quality and environmental control procedures, manufacturing of a product may not meet the quality or purity criteria set by Eurofins Genomics. “We are aware that contaminations of the nature you mentioned have been observed by several primers and probes manufacturers around the world after they produced SARS-COV2 positive controls. Those initial problems can be easily resolved by proper cleaning and production segregation procedures.”A spokesperson for PHE said that:  “COVID-19 only started to emerge at the beginning of the year and since then, PHE has managed to rapidly develop, validate and deliver an accurate test. PHE has since expanded to 12 other testing sites in Englandand supported the NHS to start testing at greater capacity in their labs. “This is the fastest deployment of a novel test to PHE and NHS labs in recent history, including in the Swine flu pandemic in 2009.”The Department of Health refused to comment.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/27/16/img-4240.jpg","title":"coronavirus food supplies farm work feed the nation campaign","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.With migrant fruit pickers unable to travel to the UK, a campaign is reaching out to people who have lost jobs in pubs, shops and bars to \u0027Pick for Britain\u0027, writes Ben Chapman\u0026nbspAisle upon aisle of empty shelves and long queues for basic groceries have been among the most visible early signs of the coronavirus pandemic.While it may seem a trivial concern when placed alongside Covid-19’s rising death toll, there’s something undeniably alarming about the sight of supermarkets stripped bare which has brought home the seriousness of the situation to many of us.But this is, as supermarket bosses have been at pains to repeat, an artificial problem. There is no shortage of food, just an excess of demand as people stock up. So far, at least.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen it comes to making sure everyone is fed, the front line of the fight is not in the pasta aisle at Tesco as shoppers scrap it out for the last pack of fusilli, but in fields up and down the country.British farmers warned this week of a coronavirus-induced labour shortage that could see millions of tonnes of strawberries, cabbages, apples, cauliflower lettuce and more rotting in the fields.‘Green lanes’ could ease shortages of fruit and veg to European shopsFor many years, the bounty of Britain\u0027s agricultural land has been picked and packed mostly by Eastern European hands. Work that years ago used to be the preserve of students making some extra money over the summer is now almost exclusively done by migrant labour.Some of those seasonal workers, mostly from Bulgaria, Romania, a few from Lithuania, are already in the UK but restrictions to stop the spread of Covid-19 mean there is a shortage of about 50,000 seasonal workers, presenting a serious problem for farmers.To plug the gap they have joined forces and launched a nationwide recruitment drive, calling on Britons to Feed the Nation by taking up seasonal roles in the fields. It\u0027s hoped that those who may have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis - chefs, retail assistants, waiters and others - will seize an opportunity for a very different kind of work.So acute is the need that the government is reportedly readying its own Pick for Britain campaign taking inspiration from the Land Army that tilled the fields during the Second World War.\u0026nbspMost places are OK for labour at this point, but in six weeks we\u0027ll be picking, says James Porter, whose family owns East Scryne Farm, a soft fruit farm near Carnoustie, home of the storied golf course on Scotland\u0027s east cost.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If things drag on, the apple harvest could suffer as could vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, celery and cabbage.That would mean more imports of fresh fruit and vegetables. But other countries are experiencing their own problems. In Kenya, a major supplier of Europe\u0027s green beans and peas, Reuters reports that half of workers involved in growing and exporting have been sent home as flights are grounded and prices for freight rise.Spain is Europe\u0027s largest exporter of fruit and vegetables and a big supplier to the UK. But it too relies on thousands of migrant workers, many of them from Morocco, who have also been stranded at home due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.It\u0027s fair to say that British workers have turned their noses up at seasonal farm work in recent years, perhaps partly due to the availability of other, more secure jobs in more comfortable surroundings.It\u0027s hard work and the Eastern Europeans are experienced at what they do, says Oliver Shooter, owner of AE Lenton, which runs a group of farms between Skegness and Boston in Lincolnshire, the centre of England\u0027s vegetable production.It\u0027s not rocket science but it is quite a skilled job that these guys do, he says. A top picker needs to know and apply supermarkets\u0027 exacting standards for exactly how fruit and veg must look, as well as how to cut it and pack it. For that they\u0027ll earn £12 an hour if they\u0027re good. Many farms also provide free or subsidised accommodation.The process is more high-tech than most would probably imagine, says Beverly Dixon, group HR director at G\u0027s, a network of large farms growing salad vegetables across East Anglia.We harvest our products in rigs, little mobile factories that go out into the field. They cut the veg at the front of the machine, it travels along a conveyor belt, gets trimmed, wrapped, boxed and put onto pallets all in one go, ready to be transported.Each rig is manned by a team of 16 who work as a family unit and will be kept apart from others as part of social distancing measures the farm is introducing.G\u0027s is looking for 700 seasonal staff, many of them pickers, but also jobs in packhouses and processing operations, team leaders, quality checkers, tractor drivers, bus drivers, forklift operators, some administrators and a handful of engineers.Bardsley, one of Britain\u0027s biggest apple producers, with an 850-hectare estate in Kent, says that in just a few days since the recruitment campaign launched the response has been overwhelming.Come July, when Bardsley starts harvesting 90 million apples - mostly Royal Gala, Braeburn, Cox\u0027s and the farm\u0027s prize-winning Bramleys - it will need some 500 extra workers. We\u0027ve put out the message on our social media saying \u0027come and join us\u0027, particularly to those people who unfortunately may be out of work at the moment. We are not slowing down, says marketing director Georgia Bardsley.We\u0027ve had such a erse range of people getting in touch. Among them are many who had until recently been working the hospitality sector that\u0027s been hit so hard by the coronavirus, including one head chef.Hopefully it gives people who have been affected a bit of hope, says Bardsley.The company\u0027s agricultural technology director, Antony Yousefian, says he\u0027s quietly confident the farm will find the people it needs. He also sees another potential positive to the situation.We\u0027ve seen a big change in consumers wanting to connect with what they eat in the last few years, he says. What a great opportunity for people to do that.I think, longer term, students will come back to doing this as a summer job.More and more of our jobs are higher skilled. We\u0027re hiring software engineers now, we\u0027ve got data analysts. So if you are a graduate, what a way to get into a farming business and apply yourself. In the day earn a bit of money and in the evening you might do some data analysis.Yousefian is currently building a digital map of the orchard to help the farm managers make better decisions by giving them real-time data on things like the climate, soil health and how much fruit is on the trees.The whole industry is changing. It\u0027s not a job that you turn your nose up at anymore.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It can be a fun feature for finding friends to chat to, but it can also very quickly become an irritating one if your phone keeps going off in your pocket.The thing that really sets Houseparty apart from other apps is hinted at by its name. Anyone who\u0027s friends with someone else in a chat can join – meaning that you\u0027re likely to run into strangers – and it is not necessarily easy to lurk without being noticed.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBoth features make the app prone to more surprising encounters than other more direct chat apps like FaceTime or Skype. But they can also very quickly make it a more annoying and confusing experience.Thankfully there are easy ways to fix such problems: with a few changes of settings, and some important menus, you can make the app considerably less frustrating.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastFrom the very moment you open Houseparty, you are on and live, and anyone can conceivably join you for a conversation. The app is built around this idea: opening the app is less like heading into a lobby and looking to call the person you want to meet, and more like wandering into a houseparty and waiting to see who might be hanging around and ready to talk.That same structure applies to everyone you are chatting with, too, which can be anyone from your phone\u0027s contacts, or your Facebook and Snapchat account. You might be in a serious conversation with your colleagues, for instance, but without some changes your friend may be alerted and opt to join in that same chat, too.So the first thing to note is that it is important to be careful with who you add on the app. More than with other apps, anyone you are friends with has the ability not just to see that you are online, but to interact with you without much warning, too.But there appears to be no way of stopping people being notified when you first sign up. Though you\u0027ll be able to deny their friend request if they send one, there\u0027s not any easy way to ensure they don\u0027t see the message and try and add you in the first place.For the same reason, it is important to lock any conversation that you don\u0027t want unexpected people jumping into. That\u0027s done relatively easily, by clicking the little lock icon at the bottom of the chat once everyone you want to be online is available, but you need to remember to do that every time.But perhaps the most important thing about the app is to fix the notifications that it sends out. As a user of Houseparty, you will both be sent plenty of notifications and have plenty of notifications sent about you – and both can be very annoying.Thankfully, it\u0027s easy enough to turn either of those notifications off. That\u0027s done by opening the app and clicking the smiley face in the corner of the screen – there, you\u0027ll see the option to Manage Notificatications, and clicking that gives you the ability to stop them being sent when you open the app or being sent to you when somebody else does the same.On both Android and iOS, you can of course also simply switch off all Houseparty notifications entirely. But that will mean that you won\u0027t even receive a notification if someone calls you, and you\u0027ll still be sending out notifications to other people, too.You can also change these settings on a per-person basis. If you scroll down a little on the notifications screen, you\u0027ll see the option to mute or ghost any given person.Ghosting them means that they won\u0027t see when you come online, which might be useful for anyone who continually tries to join you when you don\u0027t want them to. Muting somebody means you won\u0027t get notifications when they come online, which might be a good setting for anyone who keeps logging on and making your phone buzz.Perhaps the most hidden feature on Houseparty is also one of its most useful, too. If you hold down the app icon, you\u0027ll get the option to sneak in to Houseparty, meaning that you\u0027ll open it up and be on the app without sending a notification to everyone.You will still be online, however, and can be joined like normal.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

According to recent data by consumer knowledge experts Kantar Worldpanel, global supermarket sales of alcoholic hand gels have risen by 255 per cent. This is hardly a surprise considering the constant messaging from bodies such as Public Health England, that we are being “relied on” to clean our hands and that we are expected to do so for roughly 20 seconds at a time.\u0026nbspLisa Blackman, who is a media and communications professor at Goldsmiths University, has been studying panic and contagion for 20 years. She says hand sanitiser, like toilet roll, is linked to disinfection and therefore provides the means to engage in practices that enable people to feel like they are decontaminating any potential pollutants.“Given viruses are invisible and pass from person to person they threaten a clear sense of a self-enclosed border or boundary, which is important to western inidualised notions of the self,” she tells me. “This is threatening and might create feelings of abjection. Practices where people feel like they are reinstating a false sense of privacy and boundary are important to manage feelings of anxiety that might be provoked.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe adds: “I say a false sense of privacy and boundary, because what viruses like coronavirus show us is that we are all fundamentally connected and dependent on each other.”It isn’t just sales of hand sanitiser that have risen either. Some hospitals in the UK, US, Malaysia and Central America have reported a spike in thefts of the bacteria-killing gel. Northampton General Hospital told BBC News that bottles were being taken from patients’ beds and dispensers ripped off walls, with bosses saying the gel was “disappearing every day” and they have had to limit the supply on wards. Some shops have also been caught upselling bottles to make a considerable profit from anxious customers as they try frantically to protect themselves from catching or spreading the virus.Hand sanitiser plant producing 1m bottles a month to be built in UK“We thought we’d misheard her say £14.99,” her friend and housemate, Baz, says, “so I double checked, but she confirmed she’d said £40.99 and so we left empty-handed.” Botbol and Baz, originally from Paris, laugh while they recount the story, adding that the woman behind the counter insisted they look at her computer screen so they could see she “really wasn’t lying”.\u0026nbspSneezing or coughing into your hands also requires more than just a pump of hand sanitiser to disinfect themUnsurprisingly, the inflation trend is common. Over the weekend, the Edinburgh Evening News reported that a Pound Savers Homestore in the Scottish capital had received backlash for charging customers £6.99 for a single bottle of the gel. Similarly, a tweet by James Deegan went viral last week when he filmed shopkeepers at Canons Park Newsagents in Edgware, northwest London, who were charging £10 for a four-pack of toilet roll (usually sold for £2.50). Suddenly the thefts of hand sanitiser from hospitals don’t seem so shocking. Panic buying seems to highlight the demarcation in Britain’s class system, as it is implied that essential supplies are available exclusively to those with money.Pharmacists have even been forced to ration sanitisers to avoid people bulk-buying them. Jamie Harkin, who lives in Tyrone, Northern Ireland, says the new rules have been tough on him and his family, as they’re not only buying supplies for themselves but his “at-risk” grandparents too. “My friend and I heard our local Boots were selling hand sanitiser by request only, so we went to the shop to ask and were told it was strictly one per person,” he says. “I completely understand, and agree with why shops are doing it, but my grandparents are in the high risk category, so we had no choice but to go back 20 minutes later, find a different cashier and buy two more bottles.”\u0026nbspHand sanitiser has been popular in the UK since it made the move from hospital wards to high streets in the 2000s – though it wasn’t until 2012, when stores such as Superdrug and even WH Smith began reporting between 10 and 30 per cent surges in sales of the gel, that it became a staple accessory in many pockets and handbags. At the end of last year, the global hand sanitiser market was reportedly worth £1.02bn. But its popularity and, generally, effective use should not mean it replaces soap and traditional hand washing.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailManal Mohammed, a medical microbiology lecturer at the University of Westminster, says hand washing with soap and water is “far more effective” than using alcohol-based hand sanitisers. “Research has found that the detergent effect of soap and the friction of washing work together to reduce the number of microbes on our hands, as well as the dirt and organic materials,” she says. “Sneezing or coughing into your hands also requires more than just a pump of hand sanitiser to disinfect them. This is because if your hands are contaminated with mucus, the hand sanitiser might not work as well because mucus acts to protect microbes.”Sadly, this current government appear to be reinforcing the message that you are on your ownThat message seems to have been lost on the general public, though. The same data that shows a colossal surge in hand gel sales around the world\u0026nbspalso shows a surprisingly small increase in liquid hand soaps (7 per cent) and household products (10 per cent) being bought by customers. Clearly the “panic” part of the term “panic buying” has taken hold. Ironically, for hand sanitiser to be in any way effective in killing germs it must contain at least 60 per cent alcohol. And yet, says Mohammed, a lot of the brands we’re seeing sell out or be rationed in UK shops don’t even meet this\u0026nbspcriteria.\u0026nbspSo why are people buying gels en masse? The main reason seems to be a fear of the unknown, says Blackman of Goldsmiths, and its ability to ease people’s concerns. “This kind of buying temporarily relieves some of the anxieties people are feeling, but ultimately the capacity to feel safe during this crisis has to be managed by good leadership and a feeling that people are not on their own,” she says. “Sadly, this current government appear to be reinforcing the message that you are on your own and that the government won’t be stepping in to manage what is a structural issue to do with systems that are not sensitive enough to respond to spikes in demand.”How to make your own hand sanitiserDistillery owner keeps spirits high by producing hand sanitiserMan who bought 17,000 bottles of hand sanitiser to sell donates themEmma Kenny, who is the resident psychologist on ITV’s This Morning, says supplies such as hand sanitiser can help people to feel more assured at times of uncertainty. Because families are afraid of isolation – “and want to protect one another” – they develop a strong desire to be over-prepared, which helps them to feel more psychologically settled than being in a position of want. “Fear makes people act more selfishly – tribe protection becomes almost instinct based,” Kenny says. “Looking after the people you love and care for becomes paramount and the usual altruism becomes a secondary concern.”Ultimately, says Blackman, people need to feel safe – “that they can at least cover basic health and hygiene needs” – which these panic buying scenes suggest isn’t the case. Hand sanitiser is clearly more a symbol of that safety than it is the desired product. In among\u0026nbspthe madness, though, what’s important to remember is this: for all the reminiscing of what life was like BC (before coronavirus), there will be a life AC – and that’s worth remembering when you’re next in Sainsbury’s, staring at empty shelves, wondering where else you can go to find your favourite bottle of Carex.\u0026nbspFor NHS guidelines on how best to wash your hands, see nhs.ukbest-way-to-wash-your-handsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.\u0026nbsp“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.\u0026nbsp“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I was basically let go the same day.”\u0026nbspHe believes the government should either remove the cut-off date completely, or push it back to the day the scheme was announced by the government. “The PAYE records exist for previous employment, so if there’s any doubt in the government’s mind about the legitimacy of somebody’s claim, the evidence is there for them to look at,” he said.Elina, a 23-year-old who lives in London,\u0026nbspstarted her new role as a marketing and communications manager on 2 March, said she was “hopeful” the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme would be able to help her when it was first announced. “I remained cautiously optimistic until the new details were released,” she added. “It just seems like a massive loophole in my opinion.“It was worse than losing my job. Obviously, I really, really valued my employer. I think they are great, wonderful people who I respect and knew that they would have done anything in their power to have kept me and support me and they are in a really difficult time themselves.“For me it seems there should be a way to prove that you are employed by a company from the date the furlough scheme was announced, as opposed to this date of 28 February.”Rebecca Long-Bailey, a contender in the Labour leadership race and current shadow business secretary, told The Independent: “Thousands of people have slipped through the net and now face losing their jobs and months of hardship unless the government acts quickly to extend its job protection scheme”.She continued: “There is no justification for setting an arbitrary cut off date weeks before the chancellor’s announcement. He must ensure all people employed on PAYE on the date the scheme was announced are covered, to prevent further job losses.”Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trade Union Congress, added: “Employers should use the full support now available to them to keep workers on. That includes not just the Job Retention Scheme, but business interruption loans too. And they should sit down with unions to look at all options before any lay offs”.Announcing the furlough scheme earlier this month, Mr Sunak said workers who lose their jobs will be eligible for mortgage holidays and universal credit.\u0026nbsp“Firms can reemploy staff made redundant after 1 March and those who do not qualify will be able to access a range of other support – including an increase in the universal credit allowance, income tax deferrals, £1 billion more support for renters and access to three-month mortgage holidays.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

After first announcing a “state of emergency for mass immigration” following the 2015 refugee crisis, his anti-immigrant party has repeatedly renewed the legislation, even as the number of asylum seekers arriving in Hungary has fallen.Timea Szabo, an opposition lawmaker from the Dialogue for Hungary Party, said that there was no trust in the government.“If you look at the past 10 years, they’ve used their power to curb democracy and the rule of law,” he said. “So we need some kind of guarantee that they’re not going to do that again.“If all the countries in Europe could introduce similar laws with a time limit, then I believe that a Hungarian government should do that as well.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is what a government should do, but only when faced with a le-or-death situation. It is not a sane strategy for normal times.What the old dunce cannot grasp is that such gargantuan bailouts will need to be paid back by years of tax rises and further austerity. If he wants credit for the spending, will he also accept responsibility for that future hardship No, we didn’t think so.Corbyn will be remembered as Labour’s worst-ever leader, the architect of their most abject defeat in  years. He drew anti-Semites like flies to dung. He repelled decent Labour MPs and voters.Only leftie cranks and Tories will miss him.IN six weeks as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak has saved an estimated .million jobs and bailed out Britain.

That we’d all wake up and think: “Nah. My job’s not important at all. I’ve been wasting my le really, so I’ll stay in bed.”Everyone thinks their job is important, so everyone went to work, and this meant that in London especially, the public transport system was rammed full of commuters. This made everyone very angry.I don’t want to blame anyone for what’s going on. If you shut a country down overnight there are bound to be issues. It’s no one’s fault.I do, however, have a helpful suggestion for people who really do need to get to work. A suggestion that no one will have considered. It’s a means of transport that’s virus proof.You can’t be infected when you’re inside it and you can’t pass your infection on to anyone . It’s called the “motor car”.For years, successive leaders and politicians have done their best to squeeze it out of society.They’ve lowered the speed limits and raised the taxes and ­introduced congestion charging and even suggested, hilariously, thatyou ­absolutely must have one, it should have an electric motor. Like a milk float.Even the great libertarian Boris ­Johnson — a former motoring correspondent for GQ magazine — has been involved, handing half the road network over to wretched cyclists.Well, now’s the time to stop all that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.During the Covid- outbreak, when it’s important we keep our distance, all ­parking restrictions should be lted.Cars should be allowed to use both bus and cycle lanes and all traffic cameras should be turned off. I know this flies in the face of what the eco-mentalists say is good for us but buses are petri dishes so park them at the depot.Trains and the Tube are no better, so turn off the power immediately. In the last three months of last year, million people in this country had jobs. And that’s handy because at the last count there were million cars registered for use on the road.This means that everyone can get to their place of work, safely, in a virus-proof cocoon. Strange isn’t it. For years we were told that cars would one day kill us all. But now it’s obvious that actually, they are our knights in shining armour.I only ask because the phone she was using looked like it was from about .Who was she calling  Dial-a-Disc WHILE scrolling through my phone the other day I was interested to read that I could increase my immunity to coronavirus by taking more vitamin C.Then I was told I would not catch itI stared for two hours every day at a picture of Charlize Theron.Later, I received news from someone whose neighbour’s aunt lives next door to a doctor’s cleaning lady that I should drink my own urine.But I was quickly distracted by someone  whose hairdresser had hacked the World Health Organisation and found that under no circumstances should I eat anything containing vitamin C. Or look at Ms Theron.And then I remembered something Important. Every single thing on the internet is b******s.But there’s one small problem.How do you reach anything on the shelves AS I write, the whole world is trying to work out why Germany is doing so much better with the coronavirus than everywhere .The bald figures are certainly intriguing. In Britain, . per cent of people who catch the disease go on to die. In Italy, it’s a terrying nine per cent. Whereas in Germany, it’s . percent.Experts have claimed that the epidemic started there in the Baian Alps, so the people it affected were young, fit skiing enthusiasts. Who barely noticed they had it.Others have pointed to the fact that Germany has many more beds for critically ill patients than Italy. And a HELL of a lot more than the UK.Then there’s testing. For months German medics have been testing the sort of numbers the rest of the world can only dream about. I wonder, however,anyone has considered this: The Germans do well . . .  because they are German.I was once told by a professor at Rome University that: “You can have as many laws as you like in Italy. Just so long as they are not enforced.”So, when the government there first told everyone to go home and stay there, they simply carried on riding around on their Vespas and kissing everyone.It’s the same story in Britain. We were told to stay at home but because the sun was out, we all hit the park for a picnic.The Germans are dferent. You tell Wolfgang that he must wash his hands every  minutes and he will wash his hands every  minutes. You tell him to go home and he will do so, immediately.It’s probably considered racist to talk about national characteristics these days. But in these troubled times I’m going to plough on regardless and say thatwe want to survive, we’ve got to be a bit more German. And for once, do as we are told.Which I’m told is an important ­ingredient in a building project.WE keep being told that the supermarkets will be able to keep up with our demand for food. But I seriously doubt that.I was told this week that the supplier providing my farm with veg seeds had closed. And because he had no delivery drivers, he was dumping his stock.I’ve now found a replacement and I will be getting them in the ground next week. But who will harvest them in three months, when the people who normally do this kind of thing are stuck in Latvia  Students  Fat chance.To make matters worse, a lot of peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and courgettes you buy come from Spain.And who, right now, in this locked-down country, is planting them, and packing them and taking them to the docks or the airport  Still, there is some good news.Vegetarians will be forced to abandon their idiocy and start to eat meat. Lamb looks like a good bet. Because all the restaurants and pubs are shut, and exports are tricky, prices have more than halved in the past seven days.Bloody annoying for me as a sheep farmer.

The -year-old commander knows all too well what le is like on lockdown.He spent a year and a half living in a tiny tin can in close proximity to his crew.And he has some good tips for not going stir crazy.Obviously the space station astronauts had a lot of work and experiments to do, but that did not take up all of their time. And like the rest of us, they needed to keep busy.Scott has lots of common-sense advice for coping with being cooped up.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.First of all, we need to have a routine. We have to make sure we get up at the same time every morning and that we get washed and dressed and make our beds. We also need a regular bedtime.Scott says you have to get outside at least once a day — we can do that on earth — while also folowing the rules.You need to schedule times to talk to family and friends and have proper meal times.Exercise is vital. Our very own spaceman, Tim Peake, trained and completed a marathon on a running machine when he was part of the crew on the Space Station.Not all of us are fit enough to run -odd miles, but we can use this time to improve stamina and energy levels. I’m still doing my exercise classes with instructor Maxine Jones on her YouTube channel, and I will be starting virtual yoga with my daughter Rosie, who is in Singapore.I was surprised to learn Scott took actual books, not ebooks, into space.But he said holding a real book in his hands meant he could become completely absorbed, and concentration was not interrupted by messages pinging on his iPad.One of the most interesting things he said was to keep a journal of these strange times.It is more than just jotting down what you got up to that day. You need to go deeper and describe your hopes, fears and state of mind, and also what you hope to achieve when this is all over.One of the things Scott valued most during his long stint in space was video calls with family and friends. And he says one of the silver linings of this crisis is time to reconnect with loved ones.I know exactly what he means. I have been spending hours in WhatsApp chats with Rosie, my best friend Joyce, who is in lockdown in Spain, and my mum in East Kilbride.We chat about everythingand it lts my spirits. Scott’s other sensible advice is to get your information from the experts — and he advises against relying on the internet.He is right. Social media is stuffed with misinformed people and mad conspiracy ­theories.I was shocked to realise how some teens don’t watch any news outlets or read newspapers. They get their “news” from Facebook.They also think they are invincible, which is why we saw those packed beaches and parks this time last week.This was partly because they were unaware of the need for “social distancing” but also because they think it won’t happen to them.But Scott’s most important message to all of us is about working together.“All people are inescapably connected and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will be.“I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one,we all do our part and work together as a team.”Well, I would urge you all to listen to Scott.If we can put a man on the moon then we can beat this awful virus. It won’t be easy but I have faith in science.And as long as we obey the rules, and make some sacrices, we WILL overcome.NO matter what you think of him, it would be churlish not to wish Boris Johnson a speedy recovery.But my sympathies are with Carrie Symonds, who is due to give birth in three months. She’s in isolation at a time when she needs his support.My thoughts are with all expectant parents now, bringing babies into a world we barely recognise and unable to be together in the delivery room. It will be bittersweet for all of them.ONE part of the world untouched by Covid- is my spiritual homeland of Antarctica.I visited the great white wilderness three years ago and cannot wait to .Aside from astronauts, the men and women who man the science bases in Antarctica – particularly the station at the South Pole – are well used to being in isolation while living on top of one another.Which is exactly what most of us are doing right now.Living space is limited at the Pole, and there’s no escaping the other  human beings holed up at the station for the full Antarctic winter.It’s virtually pitch black for six months and you can’t really go outside apart from short bursts of vital scientic work.Most are in danger of becoming “toasty”, which is their description of going stir-crazy.Being cramped, isolated and without proper personal boundaries and “me time” can make you cranky, short-tempered and irritated by the smallest things.In order for us all to avoid toastiness during these strange times, I’d recommend a few rules, some of which were given to me by a hardy survivor of winter at the extreme south.Have a sanctuary, evenit is just in the toilet reading your newspaper and doing the crossword.If you are feeling at the end of your tether, don’t bottle it up.Talk about your feelings and listen to what others in the house with you are saying.You might very well be annoying them as much as they are driving you up the wall.It’s early days, and this is a marathon and not a sprint.Unlike those at the Pole, at least we can still go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the heat as well as the light.I’VE got a Star Trek version of Monopoly and I’m wonderingit is too soon to bring it out from the back of the cupboard.I’ve never actually got to the end of a game of Monopoly and I reckon this might just be the only time that will ever happen.I’m also going to start watching Game Of Thrones for the first time, which should keep me going for a couple of weeks. Any other suggestions for box sets gratefully received.I’M sure all dog owners would agree that our fantastic, loyal, loveable pets are keeping us sane right now. I don’t know what I would doI couldn’t take Angus for a walk once a day.It’s not just a chance to get out in the fresh air and do some exercise, which is good for our physical and mental health, but it’s having something that takes your mind off the current state of the world.When I’m playing with Angus I can almost forget those feelings of anxiety that creep up on all of us and simply enjoy his energy and enthusiasm.He needs to be fed and watered and taken care of, and that gives me a much-needed sense of purpose.It’s a proven fact that just having a dog in the house to cuddle boosts your well-being and cuts stress levels.I don’t know what I would do without him.IT has never been more vital for all of us to receive clear-headed analysis and news we can trust.That’s why it’s so important you continue to buy your Sun every day.There’s a free delivery offer for those unable to get to the shops and of course there’s our splendid online version.We need to be well informed about the latest, fast-moving events and have all the facts to best protect ourselves and our families.Thank you for your loyalty and, as always, for your comments and feedback.

Then suddenly, since Monday, we are not.It’s not even been a week since the new normal for all of us is to stay put.I am guessing that for most of us, it feels like twice that. For many of us, being unable to roam freely is the stuff of nightmares.Still, although it’s been a hard week, I am feeling fortunate. Others I know are really struggling, but I’m very lucky to have a house, a job and the basics in my fridge. But my goodness, it’s boring staying at home all the time, isn’t it At the moment more or less every day is the same. I get up, do conference calls, watch the news and go to bed.But I have been trying to do a few things dferently. For fear of my muscles atrophyingI have started using an exercise video.That may sound normal to you but for me, this is staggering. It’s one from the s and is really quite funny and ­dficult at the same time.I’ve also been more studious than usual and have been doing online lectures for my master’s degree.I have put in the hours with a TV show called This Is Us.And I’ve been cooking up a storm — making increasingly inventive recipes with bits and bobs from the back of the store cupboard because the idea of getting a supermarket delivery slot feels like a fantasy so I have not even bothered to try. I cook whatever my corner shop has in stock, which sadly is not a lot.I know many supermarkets are prioritising elderly and vulnerable shoppers, which is right and proper. And I really hope that the people who are hoarding and stockpiling out of fear soon realise that they don’t need to do that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Friends who work in the food ­industry have repeatedly told me there is no issue with supply.Especiallypeople continue to go to their local shops, which should still be stocked — and which need their custom.I am nine days into my -day self-isolating as I am still waiting to see my dad, who is recovering from cancer.And, like many others, I’m focused on the importance of being absolutely certain I am ­infection-free before I even think of going to see him and my mum.So really, I’m just sitting it out. But gosh, it’s tedious.One of the biggest changes for me is not being able to go out or see my friends. But on Friday night we had a Skype party. We all got out a bottle of wine, and I even washed my hair before we had a laugh.We are also playing the game Psych — which is great fun and played on your mobile with your mates.It’s made me realise how many of the things I blithely took for granted as being my inalienable right have changed — literally overnight.And I don’t know whether it’s a good or bad thing that my kids aren’t home with me. I’m pretty sure my daughter has already had coronavirus but happily she seems fine now.But I obviously can’t see her other than on video phone as I am isolating. And boy, do I miss her.My son, meanwhile, is with his housemates in Buckingham. They seem fine — working out in their garden gym, making meals together and playing Xbox. In fact, it’s just another day for him.I know there are people reading this who are genuinely struggling and having a seriously hard time with being isolated, who are worried about loss of income, about elderly or vulnerable relatives, or who are stuck at home with ­dficult or even violent people.It is hard to reflect on anything when we are in the middle of it.We have to focus on getting through a day at a time knowing there will be plenty of time to learn lessons when this has passed.We’ll no doubt start from the basics, like being hyper-vigilant about which animals enter the food chain, scrupulous hand-washing and reassessing our attitude towards travel — something we’ve all taken for granted for so long.We will also focus on building the NHS back up. Just as we built nuclear deterrents to protect ourselves against war, we have to protect ourselves from the ious viruses that we now know are, increasingly, out there.Yes, the important thing is the here and now. We’ve seen unprecedented events this week alone, with the PM Boris Johnson,Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty all self-isolating after either testing positive or showing symptoms of the virus.But what is vital is the long-term strategy to fight another attack like this in the future.And in the meantime, apart from feeling a bit cooped up, all in all I am pretty much doing OK with self-isolating.Apart from one thing — I can’t find any hair dye to cover my grey hair, for love nor money. Now that really is a nightmare.ASbeing stuck at home wasn’t hard enough, sports fans are having to get through this time without any football.Now that’s what I call adding insult to injury.As fans will already know, all football has been postponed until April . But behind the scenes, all football clubs, including mine, are doing whatever it takes to ensure the season finishes.I think everyone understands that our priority has to be the safety and good health of our players and the fans. So, while matches are not being played, players are doing all they can to stay fit and well so they are ready whenever it’s time to resume games.Meanwhile, the stadiums, training grounds and offices are all shut.Then, after April , we hope matches can recommence, behind closed doorsrequired.In the meantime, it’s a waiting game. So here’s hoping you’ve got some old Match Of The Day shows lined up to while away your time.ONE thing about us all having to stay at home is that it’s giving celebrities nowhere to hide in terms of what they have got to offer the world.They are on their own at home, with nothing much to do, just like us.Some – Joe Wicks teaching PE to the nation’s primary school kids every morning, Carol Vorderman holding online maths classes or Richard E Grant reading from the script of Withnail And I – are trying hard to provide the nation with useful entertainment.And then there are others. Instagram is also peppered with images of reality TV and soap stars in extremely scanty underwear.Without the props of stylists, red carpets and paparazzi shots, we see them for what they really are.Human beings, just like us.AS a week of firsts comes to a close, athletes and sports fans alike were further disappointed by the announcement that the Olympics have been postponed.Something that only a few weeks ago would have seemed unimaginable now feels, clearly, like the only sensible thing to do.Apart from the logistics involved with quarantine and uncertainty about travel restrictions, some athletes cannot train while some can, which, when the integrity of the sport is at stake, is fundamentally unfair.ANYONE  bored  With This Is Us my current favourite thing to watch, I’ve compiled a list of some other fab shows, just in case you’ve finished Succession and need some inspiration.Here goes – The Crown, Ozark, Luther, Line Of Duty, Sense, Grace And Frankie, Schitt’s Creek, Sex Education, Messiah, Spinning Out, Unbelievable and Mum.I WAS so moved by the nation overriding the old stf upper lip mentality to stand on their doorsteps to give NHS workers a round of applause on Thursday night.And then I read a tweet from a nurse saying that literally as the nation were clapping, she had received an email from her employers advising her not to travel to work in unorm or display her work ID.This is because some people have been mugged for these items and the very scant privilege – like an early supermarket slot – that they bring.Come on, people – sort it out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s not a fixed point, a date in the calendar like Easter. It is something that all of us can affect by our actions.”Mr Gove also hinted that Britain could be heading for a fresh bout of austerity once the crisis is over.He said Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s generous jobs bailout packages will mean Britain will have to go on a borrowing spree.But he insisted the Treasury is confident Britain will eventually be able to pay back the money once the nation gets back to work. And he said: “The most important thing at the moment is to save lives.During the briefing, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said Britain has now been placed on an “emergency footing” to get vital food and medicine to vulnerable people in lockdown.He said: “This is an unprecedented step in peace time, we haven’t done anything like this since the Second World War.”Three-quarters of a million Brits have now signed up to be NHS volunteers to help the nation through the crisis — smashing the Government’s , target.But ministers have faced growing criticisms that doctors and nurses have been left on the frontline without vital protective gear such as masks and goggles.Addressing the storm directly, Mr Jenrick said the Government “will not stop” until all hospitals and social care settings get the vital gear they need.The coronavirus crisis has swept through the heart of government, with PM Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock testing positive.Scottish Secretary Alister Jack is in self-isolation with symptoms.But the PM is still “firmly in charge” and running the national response via videolink from his Downing Street study, Mr Gove said.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and the ones that you should self-isolate on - are a persistent new cough or fever.Loss of taste and smell is something that can happen with other respiratory viruses.It does seem to be a feature of this from what people are reporting and it is something that people should take into account as they think about their symptoms.I think it’s for the Chief Medical Officer to decide at what point,any, diagnostic change takes place in terms of self-isolation.Those symptoms we are learning about for this disease are the ones that will get more information on over time but a new cough or fever captures the vast majority of people with this illness.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

the technical term for a lost sense of smell.The organisation says it has told Public Health England about the apparent link.Meanwhile, the World Health Organisationalso said it is investigating the link between loss of smell and taste and Covid-.Its thought that losing the ability to smell or taste could be due to the virus destroying cells in the nose and throat.Experts say its something people can commonly experience after having other types of coronaviruses - such as the common cold.Prof Carl Philpott, of the Norwich Medical School at UEA, said: Coronaviruses have previously been associated with what we refer to as post-viral olfactory loss– this is smell loss that persists after a cold.There are many respiratory viruses that can potentially cause problems with the smell receptors.So far with Covid-, the smell loss appears to be transient but only as time elapses will we know how many people have a more permanent loss.Meanwhile, there has been almost a  per cent rise in just a few days in the number of people being treated for coronavirus in Englands hospitals, according to new figures.Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said on Friday that more than , patients were in hospital with Covid-.But on Monday, he said this figure had jumped to more than ,.It comes as , people are now confirmed to have died in UK hospitals after testing positive for Covid-, as of pm on Sunday.This is up  from the , the day before.Earlier the head of the Royal College of Physicianssaid around one in four NHS doctors are off work sick or in isolation.Public Health Englandalso announced that almost , coronavirus tests a day can now be carried out.The Government had set a target of carrying out , tests a day by Sunday but PHE figures show , had been carried out as of am on Saturday and , had been carried out by the same time on Sunday.The Office for National Statisticswill this week release figures on deaths involving Covid- in the wider community, such as care homes.The ONS will look at deaths where Covid- was mentioned anywhere on the death certicate, including in combination with other health conditions.These figures are likely to inform a truer picture of how many people have died after being diagnosed with coronavirus, rather than just looking at deaths in hospitals.Speaking on a visit to the new NHS Nightingale Hospital on the ExCeL site in east London, Sir Simon said that the number of patients will increase, but extra capacity is being made available.He said: Today, there are over , positive coronavirus patients in hospitals across England and we know that number is only going to increase.Thats why what you see here is a mass mobilisation, taking place right across the country, but also at these new Nightingale hospitals.We have got available intensive care and available hospital beds but we are also bringing online additional capacity such as these Nightingale hospitals as we need them.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I went above and beyond with the coronavirus, not just washing my hands  or  times a day until they were red raw but boiling my gloves as well.I took them off first, obviously, and even photographed the act, as I was aware this behaviour was a little “out there”.But, like the committed hypochondriac I am, I figured the ridicule was worth enduring so long as it provided one further line of defence against the invisible enemy which has us all surrounded.The glove thing seemed to be working as well, right up until the time it wasn’t. And, on Sunday, March , I very suddenly became one of those symptom lists you read about.Head in a “vice-like grip”  Check. Whole body feeling like it’s been in a car crash  Yes, and the bag didn’t inflate. Feverish  Oh boy, yes.  Chills  They’re multiplying.There was the cough as well. A textbook dry, intermittent hack that’s had its moments but never really amounted to much and has left me in a grey area, medically speaking.Testing has been out of the question, so to this day I still don’t knowI’ve had coronavirus or just something  horrible. The advice from Jake at  was unequivocal, though — “self-isolation” — and the response from everyone  was almost exactly the same.“Ha ha. Not much dferent for you then.”Ha ha. Indeed not.They mean no harm, bless them. It’s the classic British response to bad medical news. They’re reassuring themselves, as you need to do with this thing.If you think I’ve spent the past fortnight sat monitoring EastEnders for minor continuity errors, though, you haven’t had coronavirus, or anything like it.The thing does not lend itself to watching television as easily as you might think. Especially not during its first week when I was sleeping for anything up to  hours a day.The time you are awake you’re in a lot of discomfort and unwilling to be reminded of your condition, which is what television is now doing incessantly, while trying to take moral ownership of the illness as well.With endless spare time on my hands, I didn’t give up on the medium, though. I thought, in fact, it might be a good opportunity to watch some of those films I’d never got round to watching, like Get Carter, Lost In Translation and The Big Lebowski. It wasn’t.I hated all three of them, especially The Big Lebowski— not because they were without merit but because I had no appetite, zero energy and was unable to stand upright without losing my breath, while watching them.I shall now associate all three movies with misery, pain and paracetamol, for ever. About the same time I gave up on films, Sky’s Football HD channel played an even crueller trick on me, on Monday.Start to finish, it re-ran Scotland’s abortive Euro  campaign. The full chronological nightmare, starting with the - defeat in Kazakhstan, which I’d witnessed first-hand.A bullet to be dodged, surely  Reader, I watched the lot and, must confess, I found it strangely cathartic and quite funny, as well as sad.Because it reminded me of a time when there was a le that stretched so far beyond the walls of my own little home isolation unit.It provided a salutary lesson as well. Television is a fickle, uncaring beast and, with some honourable exceptions, like The Repair Shop, pretty useless at cheering you up in times of personal distress.People, on the other hand, are amazing and came up trumps during my illness.I’ve been particularly blessed with my amazing and generous East London neighbours, Fatima, Richard and David, who became aware, early on, what was happeningand reacted accordingly.Every day the buzzer would go, I’d hear footsteps beating a fairly quick retreat and by the time I’d shuffled my way to the front door, dinner would be sitting by my feet. They phoned regularly as well, to check on me.Until, on Day , after a couple of  dawns , the fever had lted, I’d had my last night-sweat, could think straight again and even a hint of an appetite ed.If this is being done for one miserable, solitary, middle-aged git who boils his gloves, I have not the slightest doubt that even more noble things are being done for all those in far greater need, and humanity will triumph over this illness, with something to spare.In the meantime, my isolation continues for now and —it so pleases the British comedy gods — no, it’s really not much dferent for me.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While millions of people are in lockdown to help our brave NHS this is what is going on at London Heathrow. Someone needs to get a grip.Around , passengers passed through Heathrow yesterday and althought this was way down on the usual , a day and landings and takes off were down to one every fteen minutes - as opposed to one every  seconds it still meant regular traffice all day.While other countries are enforcing arrivals to go into quarantine, Britain is simply requesting those from abroad to follow self-isolation guidelines.There are no extra restrictions stopping people who could have travelled from the most infected cities in the world from getting on the Tube, trains or buses.In China, where the coronavirus originated, all airline passengers from abroad are in enforced quarantine, and foreigners have been banned from midnight on Friday.Yesterday among the flights that landed was one from Newark just a short drive from New York city which has seen , cases while another landed from Madrid - the coronavirus capital of Spain.A Brit passenger who was on the BA flight that landed just after pm walked through with a mask and told The Sun: There must have been around  people on the flight which was a lot more than I was expecting to see.All the crew had masks and gloves on and some of the passengers had masks or scarves over their faces but other than that there were no checks on board or anything like that.We were just asked to try and keep apart as much as possible from each other and to self isolate when we got home as we had come back from a high risk area.When I landed at Madrid last week I had my temperature checked when I landed there but there was nothing of the sort at Heathrow when I landed.In an email to staff, the airline’s Gatwick managing director Adam Carson also told workers they can “expect to hear more soon” about potential job losses.The move came after easyJet halted its entire fleet.Mr Carson said: “Due to the considerable restrictions and challenging market environment, like many other airlines, we will temporarily suspend our flying schedule at Gatwick.“I know you will have concerns and questions about what this means for you.“I appreciate there is a desire for more detail about jobs and you should expect to hear more soon.”Another traveller told The Sun: I was gobsmacked there were no checks when we landed. We were just told to go home and self isolatewe showed any symptoms but Im now getting on the tube and could infect dozensI have it.Throughout the terminals at Heathrow a tannoy message chimed out every few minutes asking travellers to keep apart and also make use of  hand sanitisers dotted throughout.A Heathrow Airport spokesperson said:“Our teams are doing their best to support passengers and provide the space and facilities for social distancing during this dficult time. We have implemented signage across all terminals to remind passengers of the government’s recommendation to social distance themselves more than  metres from others.Our colleagues are also on hand to help manage the queues and provide more space where possible. We ask all passengers to continue to follow government advice as best they can while we work to get you home as quickly and as safely as possible.”While a message on Heathrows website read:You may be used to seeing temperature checks at airports around the world, as some of our partner airports operate checks year-round regardless of outbreaks of illnesses. It may be the case that you have just landed at Heathrow from an airport that checked your temperature before you boarded your plane.There are currently no temperature checks at Heathrow for arriving flights, so you should not expect to see them when you land.This is not a measure that Heathrow decided itself we would like to reassure you that Heathrow is following the guidance and advice of Public Health Englandon which measures are required to contain and respond to Coronavirus effectively.Some government ministers are keen to ban flights from the worst affected countries and the EU has barred travellers from outside its member states for  days.PM Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab are keen not keep flights operating so they can bring back stranded Brits and one of the flights that landed yesterday was from Peru where dozens had been trapped.In a statement the Foreign Office said:There is no evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans would have any effect on the spread of infection.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Economic collapse. The PM and heir to the throne have a deadly disease and the police are using drones to tell people off for not exercising. Itaposs only been a week. Coming soon: middle-class chicken theft, Michael Gove leaving his fleshsuit chrysalis, and the tasering of anyone who refuses to jog on the spot. Our lockdown is widely regarded as vital. It keeps all of us, and others, safe. It protects the NHS from a surge it could not handle, and saves the lives of thousands from coronavirus.But yesterday the authorities said the lockdown may last, in some form, for  months. And the public perception of danger is simply never going to last that long. Weaposll either get used to the idea, or the risk will seem to disappear.Whether youaposve got the bug or not, whether you have symptoms or not, after a month of isolation you will no longer be infectious. And how tempting will it be, then, to meet up with another virus-free household - your mum, your grandchildren, the mates who live across the road. Which all begs the question: how long have we got, until mass civil disobedience begins   In week , the public perception of threat is as immediate, and certain, asthe Luftwaffe were rumbling overhead. In week , it may not be. The policeaposs randomised interpretation of the rules may seem like a bigger issue, or not being able to work, or bright summer sunshine beckoning people outside.In week ,the infection and death rates slow as expected, Stephen Kinnock will not be the only person popping round to deliver birthday cake to a relative. Andeveryoneaposs certain theyaposre virus-free, the meeting wonapost take place ft apart on the front path, either. But it will be breaking the rules. The rules which today we accept are keeping people safe, and which we are already chafing at, because they stop us taking the dog out twice a day, or driving to an isolated spot where thereaposs no risk of infection.By doing those things we raise our chances of a car crash, a twisted ankle, maybe hospitalisation. But thataposs a risk weaposre all used to, to the extent weaposve mostly forgotten it. There will be a time when even covid- seems no more risky than popping somewhere in the car. The lockdown regulations were written in a hurry, and as such are imperfect. Takeaways may stay open, but not restaurants. Room service is just as likely to be coughed on as restaurant food, but itaposs allowed. Shops are closed but online shopping is open, despite the infection risks of warehouse workers and delivery drivers. Children can be swapped between parents, but not grandparents, eventhey normally provide the childcare. The public, and the police, are interpreting things dferently. Some are being idiots, and others doing their best to be sensible while carrying on as normally as possible. It may not be aposessentialapos to give your dad a birthday cake. And itaposs not aposessentialapos to buy flowers on your trip to the supermarket. But the police arenapost going to arrest you for it, even though they couldthey wanted to. And both of them will help to keep you sane, which seems pretty essential to me.What is aposessentialapos is that everyone agrees whataposs a crime and whataposs not. And the only way any rules survive prolonged contact with human beings isthey are flexible.For example - murder is wrong, and gets you le imprisonment. Manslaughter, though, may be an accident. And itaposs possible to intentionally take anotheraposs le out of mercy, and to be shown mercy as a result. Three dferent ways to take a personaposs le, with an infinite iety of outcomes.Strict rules, in scary times, are broadly accepted. When the threat recedes, the rules need to do the samethey are to retain our consent, and for society to keep being a thing. The public need to see a route back to normality, where virus-free households can socialise, virus-free children can play together, or virus-free grown-ups can get back to work. They especially need to see it, when their own PM hasnapost been following the rules. In just a week, over-zealous police officers damaged our consent by following people with drones, or ordering those sat on park benches to go home. Itaposs entirely possible someone could be taking their daily exercise, and sit on a bench for a bit to get their breath. Itaposs possible people drove to a beauty spot because itaposs their nearest public footpath.And itaposs also possible for someone to shove his we in a car boot and drive more than  miles to pick up an eBay purchase. But rules have to flex for asthmatics having a walk, and flex again for plonkers whoaposd go that far for something worth £. The issue is how long public consent will last, and how long the lockdown will be necessary. If in a few weeks we see cases tail off, more and more people will flout the regulations, and Boris Johnson will then face a choice - does he become more authoritarian, or does he relax the rules so they bend around us  The answer depends on the progress of the disease, and its cure. If new treatments prove effective,a vaccine edges closer, the risk will dissipate, butinfections keep rising a tougher lockdown will be demanded.

But the Department for Health has now reverted to the original policy to help women who need an abortion, but cannot access a clinic due to the national lockdown.  The move will be made on a temporary basis, limited for two years or until the coronavirus crisis is over. It applies for medical abortions up to the tenth week of pregnancy.  Women will be sent the two pills required for an early termination in the post following a telephone or e-consultation with a doctor. Claire Murphy, the director of external affairs at British Pregnancy Advisory Service , welcomed the change, she told the : “This is a very safe and simple measure that will dramatically improve women’s access to care at this time of national crisis. We’re really pleased that the government has acted on this. It will make a huge dference to women’s health and wellbeing in the current climate.” She said that women in self-isolation and those with health conditions who experience an unwanted pregnancy were being forced to make “completely unnecessary” trips to access early abortion care. “Women in coerced relationships simply can’t live the house secretly in the current climate, in the way that they used to be able to. These women are effectively trapped at home,” she said.  BPAS has had to close more than a quarter of its services following a government lockdown. “Women are travelling all across the country to find clinics that are open, they are waiting in crowded NHS waiting rooms, putting their own health at risk and of course those around them and those who care for them,” Murphy said. Jonathan Lord, the medical director for Marie Stopes UK said: “The government’s decision to allow women in England to take both sets of early medical abortion pills at home during the Covid- crisis, shows that they value both women’s health and that of hardworking abortion care staff, who have continued to deliver essential healthcare, despite a global health pandemic.” "},{"url":null,"title":"parents need right paid leave","story":"NewsParents need the right to paid leave to children during coronavirus pandemicThe IPPR thinktank is warning that kids are set to become \"unseen victims\" of the measures to combat coronavirus without interventionShareByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  MAR News \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

She said: “With schools and nurseries closed, lots of parents with younger children have no choice but to care for them at home. For many, this means they can no longer work.  “Parents urgently need paid parental leave and protection from losing their jobs during this exceptional time.” Other countries where schools have closed including France, Italy and the US have give parents that right and Ms O’Grady said it should be part of the government’s job retention schem.

Fighter Darcie-May Ferris has already had six operations to remove her hands and arms - and sheaposs only four-months-old. Her limbs turned black and began rotting after blood clots in her shoulder saw her suffer a stroke in the womb before she was even born. Darcie has suffered so much in her little le but somehow the brave tot is still smiling through it all - and her parents are determined she grow up to be proud of who she is. Dad Alex said: “Darcie is the most amazing little girl with a beautul smile. She’s developing a little personality now. She knows what she wants and behaves like a little a. “Her big sisters adore her, and are not fazed by her hands and arms at all. It’s nice that she has them to look out for her, but I think with what she’s gone through, she’s going to have a really thick skin and be able to hold her own.” Prison officer Alex Ferris, , and accounts manager mum Amy Cawley, , of Verwood, Dorset, feared their girl would not survive the pregnancy after the blood clots caused a stroke in the right side of her brain. But despite her rocky start – which included spending the first six weeks of her le in hospital – Darcie’s future is looking bright, according to her parents, who are fundraising to help pay for her ongoing care. Alex, who also has a four-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, said: “Darcie has gone through so much in her little le, and we realise every day how lucky we are that she’s here. “I know she will not know any dferent as she will grow up without her arms and hands, but she will realise she is dferent to other children and it will be up to us as her parents to help her feel comfortable and be proud of who she is.” Amy, who has another daughter from a previous relationship, Summer, eight, explained that her pregnancy with Darcie was straightforward until, at  weeks, she realised she had not been feeling as much movement as she should. She was monitored with extra scans at Poole Hospital, Dorset, which revealed that Darcie was small for her age, however medics did not seem especially worried at this stage. Then, at  weeks, she became concerned when she had not felt her baby move for three days. Racing to the maternity unit at Poole Hospital, she had an ultrasound scan, which showed Darcie’s heart rate was very low.  Amy recalled: “They said they were going to deliver her then and there by caesarean section. “I called Alex’s work and he rushed over. By the time he got there I was in surgery.” Amy added: “They told me afterwardsthey had waited another  hours, Darcie wouldn’t have made it. It was so scary to think how close we’d come to losing her.” As soon as Darcie was born on  December last year, weighing lb oz, medics noticed that both her arms were discoloured and covered in black birthmark-like lesions. Before either of her parents could hold her, she was whisked to neonatal intensive care. Alex added: “The atmosphere in the room after she was delivered was very strange. They told us her arms didn’t look normal.”  Around seven hours later, the couple finally got to see their little girl. Alex continued: “She appeared to have these lesions on her arm, which at first we thought were birthmarks or a skin condition.” He explained: “I had been so excited about having a baby but when we got to see her, I couldn’t believe it – her arms were purple and black. “We were both scared. When we saw them we didn’t know how to feel or have a clue what it was.” Next, Darcie was transferred to Southampton General Hospital, in Hampshire, where specialist staff were equipped to deal with burns and skin grafts. There, she underwent an MRI to seethere was an explanation as to what was causing her condition.  Shockingly, the scan showed she had suffered a stroke in the womb on the right side of her brain, caused by a blood clot in her shoulder that had travelled up. Amy said: “We don’t know why it happened or whether it could happen againDarcie has a baby sister or brother.” “I had my placenta tested to seeit could be a genetic problem, but the tests did not come back with anything,” continued Amy. “Darcie was very heavily sedated for the first  days of her le, so she was not in pain, but she was in an incubator which made it really dficult because we couldn’t hold her. “We couldn’t cuddle her until she was eight days old which was so hard. We wanted desperately to bond with her, but not being able to touch her made it more dficult.” In neonatal intensive care, Darcie was placed on medication to try and thin her blood and break up the clots in her shoulder. At first, the treatment appeared to be working, and her left arm started to go back to its normal colour a couple of weeks after she was born – although it was too late for the fingers on her left hand.  Alex explained: “Her thumb and index finger on her left hand were okay, but she had three black fingers, and it became clear they were not going to last.” “We had to let them fall off. In fact, we were bathing her one day and a couple of her fingers just fell off. We had been expecting it to happen, but it was horrible, and we didn’t really know how to deal with it,” Alex recalled. “Her fingers looked like little sultanas. “Her first operation was to have those tidied up when she was six weeks old.  The skin had come away and left the bone, so the surgeon had to trim the bone back to allow the skin to heal over it.” Then, the focus turned to Darcie’s right arm, which did not appear to be healing as well as the left. “It wasn’t clear what the best option would be – either to amputate or to play the waiting game and seeit healed itself, because a baby’s skin has a better ability to heal than an adult’s,” Alex said. “The surgeons decided to leave it a bit longer, but it was awful because her skin was a greeny-grey colour. The skin had gone necrotic, which is where the tissue and cells start to die, and smelled really bad.”  Alex added: “It was worse towards the hand and we’d have to keep dressing it.” Having spent Christmas and New Year in hospital, Amy and Alex were delighted to finally bring Darcie home in January. Back home, they continued to change her dressings every day, and ed to hospital for weekly appointments, where doctors monitored Darcie’s progress, and carried out gradual amputations on her right arm. “The worst thing wasshe was going to have an amputation, she would have to fast from am the day before and she didn’t understand that, obviously,” said Amy. “She just knew she was hungry and not getting fed. “We did that for four weeks, and they were gradually making her right arm shorter. The fingers on her right hand had been dead for so long that they fused into her palm, so it was like one big block of dead skin.” Now, after a total of six operations, Darcie has just her thumb and index finger on her left hand, and her right arm has been amputated from the forearm. She will require further operations on her right arm, until the deteriorated skin is all gone and only healthy tissue remains, and she will also need skin grafts in the future. Alex said surgeons resisted removing her whole arm in one go, because they were hopeful that the skin would heal itself, and wanted to give her as muchas possible. Then, her parents will focus on physiotherapy. To help with the costs of her ongoing care, they have set up a GoFundMe, which has raised almost £, from friends, family and strangers. Despite all she has faced, Darcie is a bright, bubbly baby who is adored by her parents and siblings.

Ethan Gordon, from Boston, Lincolnshire, outlined four instructions the public must follow when receiving their daily post to adhere to social distancing.The -year-old went viral on Facebook after he wrote an important message to UK households during the global Covid- pandemic.His social media post has been shared , times and has received thousands of comments from residents praising postmen for continuing to deliver during the crisis. The Royal Mail worker posted a selfie taken in his van with a cat, adding: So Iaposm a Postieand would like to inform you of some important information. We deliver your parcels and letters every day. Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror What you may not be aware of is we ARE classed as KEYWORKERS through these terrible times. The CWUhave offered us to become an emergency service for the public. If things get worse, then us posties could be delivering healthcare products, food and even medication. Ethan then detailed what the public must do to adhere to Royal Mail’s strict new guidelines which ensure their workers make no contact with customers. He continued: All that is asked from the public is: Think about safety first, for yours and the postie. If you see a postie coming towards your door please DO NOT OPEN YOUR DOOR. We will sign your parcels and letters for you. We will leave the parcel, food or medication on your doorstep and then knock. Give the postie enough time to step away from the door.  If you are already outside your house, go inside or step away  metres from your postie. Please do not approach your postie. If we tell you to stop and back up or close your door, donapost feel offended. We are only trying to help protect you and us from this virus. Lastly,you see us out and want to stop us to have a chat, feel free, it can be a lonely job. BUT, remember to stay at least  metres away from your postie. NO handshaking, fist bumps, high fives, and certainly no kisses on the cheeks.Ethan finished the post by encouraging people to ‘stay safe’ in order to beat coronavirus together as a country.He said he had spotted the post online and decided to share his own version, adding step four to encourage the public to speak to their postie during these lonely times. He said: Itaposs great that itaposs got so much attention and the awareness has spread but I canapost take full credit for it.  I feel great knowing that itaposs got so far around the country. People in London, Brighton, Manchester, even Cornwall have seen, shared and liked the post along with some really nice comments. It gives me a sense of achievement but any of the other postie’s posts about this message on new Royal Mail procedures in this current climate could have gone viral. I guess I was the lucky one! Ethan also thanked those households who are going to extreme measures and disinfecting their letter boxes and door handles. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. However Ethan admitted that not all of the customers on his postal round are aware of the current crisis.He said: There are some customers on my round that arenapost internet savvy. They sometimes still come to the door to greet me and itaposs at this point I repeat the current procedures to  them.it  is for their safety and all posties alike. But, mostly everyone is happy to comply and understands why.The postman joked that his work colleagues now refer to him as a ‘celebrity’ but he laughs it off as he is just thrilled his message is being read and understood by so many. Ethan is still concerned that some people aren’t taking the virus seriously and that Covid- will continue to ‘spread like wildfire.’  But he is starting to see more and more households making changes in how they accept their post. He said: In terms of the new delivery technique - a high percentage of people are taking this very seriously.Members of the public havenapost said too much really. The topics of discussions are the same usually weather, plans for the weekend . Mainly, customers have been so nice about us posties being a sign of some normality in testing times.Ethan also pointed out that he was happy to see communities coming together to help each other during testing times. He said: It seems as though our community, and country, is a lot more positive even with all the worry and uncertainty. People are still going about their day and doing lots of odd jobs around the house they were putting off for a later time. I see a lot more people helping others out. The village I deliver has a Facebook page and Iaposve seen posts of vulnerable people asking for help with food shopping or simply getting the daily paper. Itaposs nice to see. Ethan has also been helping others and revealed he went and bought a big bag of sugar for one household so they could have their cups of tea and continue baking.  He said: Their local shop was out but I was going to the supermarket later that day so I went back and surprised them with it. They baked me a lovely sponge cake the following day. A nice gesture but I was just happy to help where I can. The postman is keen to let the country know that ‘Royal Mail are still operating, along with other delivery drivers around the country.’ We are helping the country tick over, he said. Mainly itaposs to push social distancing, including when us posties rock up to customersapos doors to deliver mail parcels.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailSo my chemo has been stopped for  weeks because of the coronavirus and I’m absolutely terried. My wonderful oncologist called me and explained that I am extremely high risk because of the chemo that I’m on . If I were to contract Covid-, it’s very likely that I would die. Six years fighting for my le and I never thought there was anything that could frighten me more than cancer - but here we are! I was told thatI were to become ill, there’s a high chance there would be no beds available due to years of cuts and this massive epidemic. The idea that I now have to go  weekswithout my chemotherapy is unbearable. The chemo is aimed at stopping any cancer coming back and, well, a lot can happen in  weeks. I know, mentally this is going to be such a struggle for me and so I just have to carry on with all my supplements etc and try to stay active in the garden. We were lucky enough to feature in ITV’s Love Your Garden two years ago so we have a magnicent retreat.We’ve just pimped it out with more fairy lights from here - my new favourite website.Our garden looks glorious and they have so many lovely items…we have light up mushrooms too, which Ivy loves. Iaposve have been hearing about people getting their Christmas lights back up, displaying in gardens and windows alike. The Shine a light movement has taken off in around the world and Iaposm joining in to show my support throughout these challenging times. Iaposve even heard of reindeer figures making an appearance. People are sharing images on social media using the hashtag #shinealight I think now is the time for people to go all out and spend this time making their space a happy place to be in.We’ve even got ourselves a new Roccbox pizza oven and I am in HEAVEN!I’m going to come out of these  weeks overweight but hey ho! I’ve got an extra year to lose my wedding weight now that’s been postponed too. In these dficult times, we absolutely have to look for the silver linings. I was worried about the amount of time off school that Ivy is having would make it hard for her when the time comes to go back - she gets really bad separation anxiety at the school drop off. But then I reminded myself that all I have ever wished for is for more time with Ivy and all she has ever wished for is to stay with me every day. Now look - we’ve got that time we’ve always wished for. I started off with a homeschooling schedule but I’ve got rid of that now and our days are made up of a little bit of learning, a little job, lots of hugs, lots of dancing and singing and lots of outdoor exploring and I honestly have never seen Ivy so happy.She’s got binoculars from Bright Minds who have loooooads of fun learning products. I’ll apologise nowany of the neighbours catch her spying out of the window.We’re also finding it quite therapeutic to slow down our pace a bit and just enjoy actually having conversations with each other again, no need to keep adding to or checking our calendar to see what plans we have or how little spare time we have. It’s actually lovely. Another silver lining for me as a self employed small business is that my rainbow pin badges have been selling out. The rainbow has become the symbol of hope throughout the world and my motto has always been to fight through the storm for your rainbow. So many NHS staff and keyworkers around the country are wearing my pins with pride!You can get yours here."},{"url":null,"title":"first look inside vast new","story":"NewsFirst look inside vast new coronavirus hospital built to care for , patientsNHS Nightingale in Canning Town, East London will be the first of the new hospitals to provide care for coronavirus patients, with the Birmingham National Exhibition Centre and the Manchester Central Convention Complex to follow in AprilShareCommentsByLewis McKenzieMilo Boyd:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video first-look-inside-londons-new-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news first-look-inside-vast-new-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

But the couple hit back, saying they donapost expect the US to pay and their security will be privately funded. The US president tweeted: I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen  the United Kingdom. It was reported that Harry and Meghan, who left the Kingdom, would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay! But a spokesman for the couple has now responded, saying the couple arenapost expecting the US to pay and that their security will be privately funded. They said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have no plans to ask the U.S. government for security resources. Privately funded security arrangements have been made.  When Meghan and Harry announced their plans to quit as senior royals, a decision which reportedly caused a lot of upset and anger behind Palace walls, they said they hoped to become financially independent. However they originally said they would continue to receive funding for security protection as Harry was born into the royal family and because of his military service. Their statement read: It is agreed that The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to require effective security to protect them and their son.  This is based on The Duke’s public profile by virtue of being born into The Royal Family, his military service, the Duchess’ own independent profile, and the shared threat and risk level documented specically over the last few years.

Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereOne set of images show loaves of bread, bunches of bananas and numerous bags of potatoes overflowing from black bins.James tweeted: All those panic buyers who emptied the shelves and are now doing this should be fined! Pictures taken by refuse collectors on their rounds! Absolutely fuming!! Other pictures show unopened meat and veg left on the ground to be collected.Posting on Twitter, Liberal Democrat Councillor Ajit Singh Atwal said: To all the people in this great city of ours in Derby,you have gone out and panic bought like a lot of you have and stacked up your houses with unnecessary items you donapost normally buy or you have bought in more food than you need, then you need to take a good look at yourself. With councils closing recycling centres, and bin collection teams threatening to down tools because of coronavirus, the rodents are swarming in to feast. The fear is the rats, some more than a foot long, will sneak into homes and spread crippling Weilaposs disease and other illnesses through their urine. Many have become resistant to over-the-counter poisons and with spring nearing, experts say they will be breeding increasingly. The National Pest Technicians Association warned that aposgood housekeeping is more important than everapos to stop the risk spurred by panic buyers who have stuffed their cupboards with supplies and are now dumping it. NPTA technical manager John Hope said: It will have an effect on public health because,youaposre stockpiling goods, thereaposs more food there to attract rodents. Itaposs the same as when rubbish piles up on the street due to missed bin collections - the more thataposs there, the more chance there is of attracting rodents without actually seeing them, because they can get in there unnoticed by time you get to bottom of the pile. Public health pests such as rodents, cockroaches and house flies are known to carry bacteria and can pass this on to people.  To counter the threat of infestations, Mr Hope has advised people in the UK to move any rubbish to an outside bin as soon as possible and try and ensure that this is tightly sealed. He also recommends inspecting houses or offices for cracks or holes in walls, unfilled voids around pipework and checking dried food packages for pest activity before use - particularly where excess food is stored. Be careful about storing food in outbuildings or garages, as these will be at increased risk of pest damage as these buildings tend to be less secure than our homes he warned. If possible, keep bushes and shrubbery away from the building to make the area less attractive to pests.

Jo Bowtell launched the The Virtual Pub Facebook page just over a week ago and regularly hosts live music, quizzes, DJ sets, open mic and comedy nights.The -year-old started the page as a way to bring her local community together after running the The Noel Arms in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire for several years. But the group has proven so popular it has attracted over , members from as far away as Australia, USA, Canada, Spain and Italy. It means the mum-of-two has been forced to enlist staff members on the other side of the globe in order to keep her customers entertained when she goes to bed.Have you found a novel way to keep yourself entertained during the coronavirus lockdown  Email webnews@trinitymirrorShe currently has a team of ten, which include bar staff, who talk to customers, and bouncers, who moderate who is allowed into the pub. Hundreds of people have been sharing selfies of them enjoying a tipple from home as they tune in to watch DJ sets on a Friday night or a comedy show on a Sunday. Jo, of Spondon, Derby, says the pub is the biggest she has ever ran and the page has turned into a full-time job during the coronavirus crisis. She said: It has completely blown up. Weaposve got , members just waiting for approval - itaposs like thereaposs a queue at the door to get in. Itaposs the biggest pub Iaposve ever ran and I canapost believe how popular it has become. It started as just a way for locals in Melton Mowbray who knew the pub to keep in touch. Now, Iaposve got people in Hawaii tuning in to watch a DJ set and people stranded in Italy watching comedy nights with their mum in Britain. Itaposs really nice to be able to bring people together in these dficult times in the most British way possible. It is pretty much like going to a pub but doing it from your living room or back garden. Itaposs keeping communities entertained and friends and family connected together.  It is like running an actual pub without the hassle of serving the booze. I have to delegate jobs to my team. As well as moderators who vet who is allowed in, a friend of Joaposs in Australia looks after the page during the night so there is entertainment on the page  . Weaposre encouraging people to drink responsibly though, the landlady continued. We have coffee mornings as well. As a landlady you tend to be a pillar of the community, who people turn to in times of need. Youaposre there for the good, the bad and the ugly. You almost have a moral obligation, the pub is an extension of the home for most people, but now their homes are the extension of the pub. There are key workers getting in from work at odd hours and it is a way to connect with people. We keep it light-hearted and thereaposs a lot of banter but I donapost tolerate bad language or derogatory comments. Iaposm a bit of an old school landlady like that.  But it means I need a team of people to moderate the page, and arrange artists to perform. We even have a private aposgreen roomapos group. Its like running a TV station. Music and quiz nights have been running through Facebook live video feeds, with answers posted in the comments. Last Sunday, a comedy night was hosted by four performers communicating through Skype, which they filmed on YouTube and posted to the page. And this weekend a Jo Wicks-style boot camp was hosted in the morning, followed by a cocktail making class in the afternoon and live music and a quiz in the evening. Performers have been able to share their PayPal details with viewers who can donatethey choose to. There is even a thought of the day from -year-old Gentleman Jim - the stereotypical old man in the corner who will sit with his half a pint of mild. Full-rime mum Jo added: Everyone is buying into it as they can sit at home and be entertained asthey are in the same place. It is a haven.  Some members of the page have been playing it through their television. So its like having the pub singers right in your front room. Everyone seems to be really happy with it and I feel like something positive is happening in the world. Iaposm not doing it for profit and the team are working voluntarily. In such bleak times, it is important to find a positive and with all the bad news going around I think it really puts a smile on peopleaposs faces. Customer Dawn Richardson, , from Melton Mowbray, said: It is keeping me entertained all day. I just love it. It has brought people together.

Bottom of the second tier got £,.Could they not pay out the minimum to everybody right now and decide the rest later Welcome to lockdown everybody!

for the dundee clubs","story":"Ayr United captain Ross Docherty insists he’s not been surprised by how well his former team-mates have fared at Dundee and Dundee United.Declan McDaid joined the Dark Blues from the Honest Men last summer, with Lawrence Shankland and Liam Smith swapping Somerset Park for Tannadice.Shankland has notched  goals in  games for the Terrors and Scotland, while Smith and McDaid have been standouts for their clubs.Goal machine Shankland has particularly impressed Docherty.“It’s not been a surprise to me at all how well he’s done,” the -year-old midfielder said.“I had every confidence in him going up there at the start of the season because he’d done it for Ayr.“We were a decent team last season but he’s gone to Dundee United and they’re dominating the league.“If he gets a chance, he’s going to score and he’s maybe been getting a bit more service up there.“He’d dried up before the league stopped but they’d been struggling as a team.“His form has seen him get caps and a goal for Scotland which is amazing.“He knowshe performs he’s going to get an opportunity.“There’s been a shortage of strikers, obviously, but you can’t take it away from Lawrence.“Boys can look at him and take confidence and encouragement, even though they might not get a Scotland cap playing in the Championship.“It’s unexpected and a bit out there but,you’re going to perform well over a period of time, there’s chances out there to better yourself.”And Doc puts a large portion of Shankland’s improvement down to the -year-old getting himself into shape mentally as well as physically after joining Ayr.The former Livingston and Airdrie man added: “With any striker when they’re going through a period of good form then it’s got to be about having confidence.“That comes from doing well and what started that off was when he came in at Ayr.“He was maybe a wee bit unfit having not done much over the summer before signing for us and he was unfit the season before – he’d be the first to admit that.“His head wasn’t right so it was a number of things but he come in, got as fit as he could and he’s just in a better space.“He was like a dferent guy to the one I played against before and, once you get that, the confidence and the ability he has makes him unstoppable in the league at times.“I’m fairly close to him and he’s a bubbly character but it’s a quiet confidence.“He wouldn’t be bragging to anyone about anything or in anyone’s face.“He knows he’s good enough and that’s probably what a lot of good players miss in this league.“He’s one where,he misses a chance, he knows he’s going to go and score the next one.”Although a dferent character, Docherty believes Smith is almost as important to the Tangerines as Shankland.“I’m not surprised he’s been one of United’s most consistent players because he was the same last season at Ayr.“He came in and flew under the radar but, with two or three months to go in the season, people were starting to say ‘he’s been amazing for us’.“He did it the whole season but he sometimes goes unnoticed but that’s probably because he is such a quiet boy.“He’s a steady Eddy and he and Lawrence link up well.“They did it at Ayr but when you look at us compared to what Dundee United have in terms of budget this season I’m not surprised they’ve gone and done it again.”Docherty does admit, though, that McDaid’s transformation into a left wing-back under James McPake at Dens Park was unexpected.“I’ve seen recently they’ve been playing a -- so he’s almost been playing wing-back,” he added.“I spoke to him and, obviously, as a winger you never really want to be playing there so he was kind of laughing about it!“At the end of the day, though, it shows that he has that side of his game and will benefit him in the long run.“If people maybe two years ago, and I was probably one of them, had thought that Declan McDaid would be playing wing-back they’d have laughed.“He wasn’t as good defensively but now you can see he’s really improved there.“Whenever we’ve played them or I’ve seen them on the telly he’s been one of their best players this season.“It’s brilliant for him, the same as Lawrence and Liam, that boys from Ayr can go to these other clubs and really perform.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/DNic_Whorterbank_Signs-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"whorter

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

Based on a hillside, looking down towards Kilchurn Castle, the Tigh Mor project has been developed over several years and has included many volunteers, including primary school pupils.The project has shown evidence of rural le in the th and th-centuries and has clearly demonstrated how archaeology can bring people of all ages together to help develop a site and create a wider interest in their local heritage.The next meeting will be held at .pm on Tuesday March , in the Nicoll Hall.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post comments.ldquoThe real challenge will be to ensure likely local residents businesses are aware and can gain access to participate."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Those who commit themselves to months alone at sea in the name of le-changing moments, philanthropy and legacies.It was in  that The Sunday Times announced the award of a trophy, The Golden Globe, for the first person to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world. The event was the first organised, non-stop race around the world for iniduals. Those attempting to make the journey had little understanding of how the experience would pan out or how their minds would cope with a year in isolation.The only sailor to complete and therefore win this first feat was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who crossed the finish line after  days alone at sea. Knox-Johnston once said: ldquoYou donrsquot really knowyour brain will stay sane. Your sense of humour is absolutely essential.Now a sailing legend, Knox-Johnston founded the famed Clipper Yacht Race, an event he started so that everyone who wanted it ldquocould have the opportunity to experience the challenge and sheer exhilaration of ocean racing.Sir Robin spoke on the current pandemic on his Twitter feed stating: ldquoBack from the Philippines, the crews now home and the boats sitting for the next - months by which time we hope this virus will be history.\"Now in self-imposed isolation for which my past has trained me perfectly. Look after yourselves everyone.A physical challenge on the surface, ocean racing is fundamentally a mental marathon. An endurance test for the mind to adapt in an ever-changing and high-risk environment.As the power and effect of the pandemic takes hold of the world, the constant change of climate and influx of data leads for new adaptions every day. This is an environment not dissimilar to the challenges faced by iniduals who take on these solo excursions.As a marine marketing agency, Gordon Ritchie, director of GRM Marketing, continues: ldquoDealing with offshore yacht racing and rowing can bring out the best in you. All of the small teams or iniduals are normal people doing extraordinary things.\"They are all well planned and determined. They all have a complete resolve to overcome any challenge placed in front of them and are determined to get to the start line ... that can be just as dficult as getting to the finish line where the risk lies mainly with the team or inidual.GRM is no stranger to supporting sailors and rowers making their way to the start line ready to embark on psychological journeys of self-isolation out at sea.The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is a -mile rowing race beginning in La Gomera in the Canary Islands and ending in Nelsonrsquos Harbour, Antigua. The race can take anything from a record-breaking  days to four, back-breaking months.This year, GRM supported two teams in this race named \"The Worldrsquos Toughest Row\", BROAR as they made their way to the start line and HMS Oardacious in PR during their final stages. In December, team HMS Oardacious became the fastest serving military team to cross the Atlantic and raised nearly pound, to provide mental health and wellbeing support to their submarine community for The Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity. The charity aims to support personnel, veterans and families as they overcome challenges faced during and after service.Following the impact of the pandemic, mental health has arrived back at the forefront of many online and government discussions. With businesses facing collapse, iniduals facing job losses and with millions now confined to their homes, this pandemic is predicted to move from a physical crisis to a mental one.The anticipation of lockdown and self-isolation has been the anxiety-inducing issue facing iniduals worldwide as we adapt to this new normal. It will take a period of adjustment, but as in all situations and challenges we adapt, and can in time prosper.As serving submariners in the Royal Navy, HMS Oardacious shared their unique insight on self-isolation when embarking on the Talisker Atlantic Challenge.Lieutenant Hugo Mitchell-Heggs explained: ldquoAs a Royal Navy submariner we are well versed with spending extended periods of time deployed, isolated from society, our loved ones and what most would consider home comforts.He continued: ldquoSettling into a routine and being creative is fundamental to onersquos own wellbeing. Itrsquos never easy settling into a new pattern, and even for submariners, the first week at sea is often the most challenging.\"We also observed this on our ocean row, adapting to each other and our teamrsquos dynamic, to our new diet, safety culture and challenging environment. Twenty-foot waves and gale-force winds from day one was challenging, but with the right mindset we adapted and found ways to not just survive but also thrive.\"The benefits of a routine, and building things to look forward to in your day are a fundamental tactic for maintaining motivation and positivity while self-isolating.\"He said the value of a routine was that it \"provides structure to the working day, to the week and to the whole deployment patrol which can often go on for months on end\".\"Nutrition, exercise and mental stimulation are fundamental to thriving. During the ocean crossing, physical stimulation was aplentybut keeping our mental stimulation took being both creative and adaptable: audiobooks, podcasts, Christmas day karaokeand most importantly, conversation with our crew mates ndash whether it was jokes, banter or a lsquodeep and meaningfulrsquo while rowing under a moonlit sky.Upon speaking to Mitchell-Heggs and taking time to reflect, it becomes clear that in this period of crisis, we as a society have found great dficulty in the removal of the freedom to see those that we look forward to seeing, or the cancellation of events we look forward to experiencing. Holidays were the first to go, then events and gigs, now seeing friends and loved ones. What we now need to do is to find things in a simple day routine to look forward to.Your evening meal, your FaceTime to a friend, your weekly trip to the grocery store. Like the submariners who look forward to their short slot in the gym, or their two-minute shower, happiness, contentment and in the extreme, sanity, are found in the simplest of tasks. The tasks we, on a day-to-day, take advantage of being able to do.Nicola Sturgeon explains of these unprecedented restrictions ldquole shouldnrsquot feel normal right now. Soyour le still feels entirely normal, ask yourselfyou are doing the right things. Every time you think about meeting up with, or coming into physical contact with other people, ask yourselfit is entirely necessary\".What also becomes apparent when discussing isolation and its mental challenges are the importance of the snippets of communication and information that keep spirits up when iniduals are miles from the coast or deep beneath the sea.Finding a source of creativity, communicating, staying active is key to survival, as is remaining positive and having a laugh.Though being at sea adds in a whole number of dangers, the general population today faces saying goodbye to their loved ones with no foreseeable end in sight. The concept of self-isolation, a once-unfamiliar term to the masses, has now become every inidualrsquos reality.In the coming months, we will see the effects of this new \"self-isolation\" and begin to understand the trials that sailors, rowers and explorers endure when taking on challenges that disconnect them physically from the outside world.Gordon Ritchie continues: ldquoIn the light of the Covid- outbreak we should consider that we are now at the start line and all we have to do is complete the challenge and get to the finish line.\"The common outcome is that everyone will have gained a lot from the journey, and be in a much better place when the champagne is uncorked.In this time, it is worthwhile to challenge yourself, try something new, learn something, donrsquot stagnate.\"If we can do it isolated in the middle of an ocean, anyone can do it from the luxurious comfort of their homes and with that constant connectivity, muses Lieutenant Mitchell-Heggs.How to beat isolation, by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston\"Isolation can be incredibly frustrating. But it does not have to be.\"People ask how did I manage  days alone at sea, but the answer is that I was constantly busy. I had a boat to sail, navigate , maintain, steer, plus feed myself. But in that lies the answer, create a project to focus the mind and pass the time.\"If you are a yachtsman, you can learn and practice your knots, or how to throw a line ashore. If you are a landsman, well those knots are always useful.\"Bear in mind I had no one to talk with. No communications at all for most of the time, so I had to think of things that would keep me mentally stimulated. I took to learning poetry. We have wonderful poetry in the English language, but anything that makes the mind work is good.\"Now many of us are staying at home with time on our hands, we could put the time to good use. It might amuse children as well.\"Knots are something many of us use daily so why not practice them, and learn a few new ones  It will keep those skills you have learned fresh for when you can get outside and for my Clipper Race Crew ndash when you re-join your boats next year.\"You have probably seen lines thrown from a boat that donrsquot cover the distance, or get tangled on their way. I suggest you go out into the garden with a rope and practice to develop this skill. A quick tip is to make two coils, not too large, and throw the smaller one allowing the larger one to unravel as the first one extends.\"Isolation is something we are going to have to get used to for the next few weeks. I had  days of it, but I had plenty to do during that period which made the time pass reasonably quickly. So there is the answer. Create a project to fill the time.\"I cannot get over to my boats where there is always something to do, so the garden furniture is getting sanded and re-painted and then I will have to face up to the long put-off job of sorting out everything in my Man Cave, apart from sorting out our new Clipper Race schedule, of course.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  39 s Country Life  the wonders of a walk on the wild side","story":"A friend who moved from London to Edinburgh before finally settling in a village in the Highlands, was quick to disabuse me of my perambulating dreams. In the city itrsquos easy to clock up miles on foot without even noticing, simply going about daily le. In the country, much of what you do requires a car or bus. Unless you have a dog ndash and a great many people round here do ndash it would be possible to live in the lap of hills, heath and woodlands without stepping beyond the garden gate in good weather and the front door in bad. This friend can go for months without getting her crampons on.Yet it is hard resist the call of the wild. On fine weekdays, as I sit at my desk, I hear the villagersquos retirees clumping past in their hiking boots, leaving base for an attempt on the nearby peaks, or merely a gentle stroll along the riverbank. Hoolet has more than its fair share of Munro-baggers, lean folk with the legs of grasshoppers and enough puff to inflate a hot-air balloon. There are so many dedicated walkers, in fact, that it probably partly explains why theyrsquove chosen to live here. Whatever the starting point, there are enough paths and trails to carry you across the borderlands and deep into Northumberland without using a drop of petrol.Another of my northern chums ndash she works on farms but still has the face of an English rose ndash has been planning a visit with her pony. She hopes to ride through Roxburghshire to Lindisfarne, a journey of  or  miles. As she BBs her way south, she requires not just bed, bacon and scrambled eggs but a basket for her sheep dog and grazing for her packhorse.Few things are more frustrating than not being able to stretch your legs because yoursquore working, knowing that others are out there having fun. My husband is often one of them, ing bright-eyed, invigorated, and caked in mud. He could feature in a detergent ad, though moleskins and scratchy socks coated in a rich chocolatey goo are not as photogenic as grubby football strips or toddlers drenched in spaghetti sauce.When I do get out, however, there is nothing quite like it. I can either walk up the back garden and out of the gate through the sheep field towards the lower slopes of the hills, or head into the village until I reach the woods. The first route takes me past cherry trees that in summer are laden with fruit, dangling from every branch assomeone has gone overboard decorating the Christmas tree. Itrsquos no wonder the place is alive with birds, who can gorge themselves on a daily replenished source of fruit, nuts, seeds, and the insects that nibble among them. With the squirrels getting back up to speed after winter, competition will soon heat up.One of our bird feeders fell out of the apple tree last week, thanks, I suspect, to a swinging squirrel that chases off the finches and blue tits whenever it swarms up the tree trunk. I watched the other morning as it dangled upside down from the summerhouse roof, desperate to find a way into the new feeder wersquove hung there, specially designed to keep it out. So far itrsquos showing far more interest than the birds. Who knows, maybe it willwith wire-cutters Up in the woods I once followed a squirrel that ran ahead of me for half a mile, turning to peer over its shoulder every few seconds asto make sure I was keeping up. Occasionally Irsquove come across roe deer, who take a startled look before leaping away like show jumpers. These woods are my favourite part of the walk, beech masts crunching underfoot, and thick drts of leaves hiding treacherous roots and holes. Thanks to the abundance of larches and pines, I sometimes catch the scent of the aftershave my father used to wear. And, even when rain is thundering, the canopy is so dense that in here it is dry.Itrsquos another world when you emerge from cover and start climbing. Leaf mould gives way to gorse and heather and a rutted track. We once met a man leading his horse as he bent double poring over the ground. He was retracing the route where, at some point, he had dropped his car keys. We took his number in case we came upon them, but yoursquod need a metal detector out here to have any chance. Scree and boulders, waist-high bracken and swamps of moss could swallow anything pocket-sized for the rest of eternity.By this point itrsquos high enough to catch a breeze, even on virtually windless days. Out on the hilltops themselves it can blow so hard that not just untethered hats are in danger but even sunglasses can go flying. Yet blustery or calm, sodden or sunny, the view from the summit stops time in its tracks.Spread out below is a peaceful landscape of fields and trees, sheep and cattle, and the occasional dawdling car. The hazy blue Cheviot hills fade into the distance, snow still clinging. In one direction lies the nearest town, dinky as Lego. In the other the horizon disappears much as it has for centuries. On my favourite peak, in fact, there is evidence of bronze age settlement, the trace of ancient forebears right beneath our feet.Itrsquos a reminder that, geology apart, what you see from up here is a largely manmade picture, the product of aeons of habitation and cultivation. Despite, or perhaps because of, that, getting a larkrsquos eye view is a great leveller. This vantage point invites you to think of those who came before, and those who are to follow. It also heightens respect for those creatures working ceaselessly to survive, never knowing what tomorrow holds. The sense of smallness and transience this provokes is oddly reassuring."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-menu-make-store-cupboard-go","story":"Now, of course, the supermarket sweep has become something of an adrenalin sport, a Mad Max ldquodo or die dash to the chill cabinet and a frustrating game of hunt the pasta while giving fellow shoppers the death starethey stray too close while pushing potentially contaminated shopping trolleys with their elbows.Planning the family meals for the week ahead has come down to writing a shopping list, chucking it in the bin and hitting Tesco dressed head to toe in plastic to grab the last sad cans of green lentils and mushy peas.In a land of plenty where we expect our shopsrsquo shelves to heave with precisely what we want, is it now at all possible to eat well, healthily and preferably not starve And, should we actually feel brave enough to go shopping, what should we snap up to ensure we put decent food on the table Dr Gillian Purdon, head of nutrition science and policy at Food Standards Scotland, says: ldquoThis is a dficult period for people who may have not have access to their normal choice of foods.

An investment would have increased our capacity to do something, austerity did the opposite, needlessly squeezing public spending and destroying countless jobs in the supply chain, leading to a decade of economic stagnation.It is vital to realise that when the Government grasped the scale of the crisis, pound billion was made available. This was not money saved up for a rainy day, it was money simply created to allow the Government to redirect the economy to a dferent path. If we need another billion pounds or another trillion, it can also be made. When the economy s to running at full capacity, we can choose to pay for it through some combination of lower spending and higher taxes and higher inflation. But not until then. And the Tory Government could have taken the same decision to abandon austerity at any point since the global financial crisis to drive the UK economy, but it chose spending cuts over protecting people.Alan Ritchie, Glasgow G.I WISH I shared Rebecca McQuillanrsquos optimism .Nothing will change when we get through this crisis in terms of the relationship between the haves and have-nots.This crisis will make nary a dent on the fortunes of Messrs Ashley, Martin and Branson.However, when shops open their doors again, pubs start selling beer once more and people resume flying, those who have been laid off viciously and unceremoniously by the respective owners will seek toto diminished businesses.If there was any justice Sports Direct shops and Wetherspoons pubs would remain as deserted as they are today but the people who would really suffer would not be their billionaire owners . The people who would suffer are the ex-employees competing for a reduced number of jobs.Who do you think will retain the upper hand the fat cats sitting on their piles of cash dangling the carrot of a limited number of low-paid jobs, or the employees who desperately need to recover from the debt they have unwillingly fallen into and whose Government aid has run out because we were all in it together but now we are back to ldquonormal The billionaires will still be billionaires but the poor will end up poorer.William Thomson, Denny.WHILST we rightly focus on the physical health of the population, the stock market rocks back and forth with many investors losing money and some iniduals making a lot of money by gambling on shares rising or falling.The lasting impact will be on the value of our major companies, normally profitable, making them targets for takeover by foreign companies at knockdown values. We have already seen Scottish companies taken over by Chinese and Korean businesses and production then being moved abroad. Witness for example the transfer of a majority of production of green technology to other countries and the failure of the Scottish Government to achieve its employment targets on renewable energy.We have a Westminster Government which believes in the free market and happily sees business sold off. The time has come to offer the same protection to business as the population at large. Stop all trading on the stock market till the crisis is over and ban the sale of UK companies to foreign companies and governments for the next two or three years in order to offer longer term protection to the working population.Bill Eadie, Gfnock.THURSDAY nightrsquos meaningless gesture of standing on your doorstep clapping NHS workers was frankly akin to rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. I did not take part.Donrsquot get me wrong. As a cancer survivor I thank every single day for the fabulous treatment I received  years ago at the hands of our wonderful consultants, GPs, nurses, porters and auxiliaries. I agree with John NE Rankin . If we really want to support our NHS staff, lets pay them all a decent living wage, fund the NHS properly. We can do it. All we have to do is cancel Trident.What would you rather do have the capability to bomb a third world country or care for your elderly relative or loved one in a properly funded hospital or care home  Donrsquot stand on your doorstep clapping, campaign to ensure we have plenty of protective equipment for all our health care professionals ndash including care home workers. Value their contribution to our lives.Make sure they donrsquot have to work -hour shts. I am in my seventies, you donrsquot need to tell me what is valuable in le ndash health is the single most important thing we have.Anyone that thinks itrsquos better to fund Trident is frankly off their heads.If there is one thing that comes out of this dreadful situation we are all facing, it is that we must get our priorities right.Sheila Duffy, Glasgow G.THE Covid- pandemic is a viral disease which due to its scale has caught a lot of health systems on the hop. One of the inconvenient truths emerging about the disease is the number of very valuable health care workers who have become seriously infected with the disease whilst trying to aid their patients.This brings me to ponder the future method of providing health care for this type of epidemic given its sheer scale. We must therefore keep those presenting with new diseases away from our general hospitals.Would it not be possible to start designing and constructing large-scale isolation and treatment and control units with one huge central floor area ward to accommodate the very ill  All support systems would be bolt-on external units. They could be built and left in readiness.Specically, all attendant medical staff would work in the ward by using self-contained non-cumbersome support suits with additional plug-in ports for remote air supplythey were required to stay on station for an extended period. Upon leaving the area all would go through a dry or wet cleaning room before disrobing. All equipment should be reusable after drying and sterilisation.The North Sea designers for saturation ing, I feel sure, could provide valuable input to the methodology to support current medical standards and the extreme sports clothing designers likewise.Hopefully we will get through this crisis relatively unscathed, but lets be prepared the next time.Archie Burleigh, Skelmorlie.THERE are media reports on a daily basis of the statistics relating to the incidence of coronavirus in a number of countries. These relate mainly to those countries with a well-developed healthcare system: China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and, now, the United States.It is recognised that even in those countries where some testing can be conducted, there will be ying degrees of under-reporting.There is less reported information from other countries such as Greece, many in Latin American, Turkey, Scandinavia and the Balkans.Turkey, Italy and Greece have the additional problem of providing shelter to large numbers of refugees.As far as Africa is concerned, only South Africa has recently figured in the news.In many countries there is a huge disparity between the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots\", with the latter greatly outnumbering the former. The possible spread of the virus among those with little access to healthcare must be a terrying prospect. Intensive care units, protective clothing, ventilators  No chance. Social distancing in the crowded cities of India would seem impossible.Many aid agencies must be greatly concerned about the likelihood of financial support becoming much reduced as inidual contributors and governments struggle to support those in need closer to home. Most charity shops are now closed.Fortunately, there have been examples of kindness and neighbourliness extended to those in need of assistance. As the outbreak continues, there is a risk of this support wearing thin and there will be a need to remind ourselves that \"our neighbour\" extends beyond those in our immediate vicinity.Malcolm Allan, Bishopbriggs.LAST Friday I decided to avail myself of the generous offer, by Sainsburys, of the -am shopping hour for older people. So off I went to our store in Kelso wondering what would be happening.I have to say that I was greatly impressed by the organisation of the event, where staff conducted it all with friendliness and tact. I must also congratulate the older folks, queueing and then shopping, for their good manners and conduct. The staff replenishing the shelves were, as ever, friendly and helpful, and what efficiency as ever. This -am hour will now be when my weekly shop takes place on either Monday, Wednesday or Friday each week.Thank you to all at Sainsburys and I must also include members of staff at other places in this douce Borders town of Kelso who are managing things so efficiently. Indeed thanks to all who are involved in keeping our communities running as well as possible.I shed tears and smiled a lot last night as I clapped outside my house at pm, for my two nieces, and all the others in the medical profession, who are in the front-line battle against our common enemy. I heard other clapping coming out of the misty night and felt comforted.Thelma Edwards, Kelso.FOR the many families living in homes with no gardens, often on upper levels with no balcony, the impact of only being able to leave their homes for exercise once a day may have a signicant adverse impact on childrens physical and emotional health and development.With playparks shut and the advice being to exercise near your home, should we be mindful of some discretion for families living in confined spaces without gardens This crisis highlights the disparities in our society and as ever, the disadvantaged will pay the highest price.Diana Turbett, Isle of Arran.Read more: It is right that Scotland should take its own coronavirus approach"},{"url":null,"title":"politics-watch-thou-shalt-skype-moment","story":"Not so now. This is current affairs, brought to you by coronavirus. Video conferencing is Britainrsquos growth industry. People who hitherto thought Zoom was a synonym for speed are busily sending meeting ID codes to colleagues and friends.And just when Skype seemed rather passeacute, it is on every political  show in the country, as the presenters we are so used to seeing surrounded by people are suddenly surrounded by screens. Yesterdayrsquos Ridge on Sunday, Sophie Ridgersquos Sky News show, which is proving to be a more-than-competitive rival to Andrew Marr on the Beeb, was a tour de force of remote contributions. With the clocks having moved forward, as we blearily pressed  on the Sky remote we were faced with Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who had also stood in for our coronavirus-positive Prime Minister Boris Johnson at Fridays daily Government press conference.My first reflection was to wonder what the odds would have been, four years ago when Mr Gove torpedoed Mr Johnsonrsquos Tory leadership campaign, of the former being the latterrsquos right-hand-man at a time of national crisis. As usual, though, Mr Gove was in complete charge of his brief as he delivered the incredibly serious and dficult message that there is no fixed end date to the lockdown.Big hitter though Gove is, he was followed on Ridge by the biggest hitter of my adult le - former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Customarily, Mr Blair did what the country still seldom gives him credit for he answered the questions he was asked fairly and reasonably, giving his experience of how governments around the world handle crises.The public mood of co-operation - the lsquoall in this togetherrsquo spirit which has characterised the last fortnight in particular - was brought to a halt by Labour leadership contender Rebecca Long-Bailey who, following the lead of her mentor Jeremy Corbyn, has struggled to join in the national group hug. The sky-high approval ratings for both Mr Johnson and the Tory party, which sailed over  per cent in a poll on Friday, will not persuade them to sht their strategy.Over on BBC, Mr Marr broadcast his show from the BBC newsroom rather than his usual studio which, in addition to the absence of guests, was another visual display of the dference coronavirus is making to broadcasting. After Mr Gove made his second appearance of the morning to close the show, attention turned to Gordon Brewerrsquos Politics Scotland, which opened with Scotlandrsquos new national hero, Jason Leitch.Dr Leitch, Scotlandrsquos favourite dentist, already has a CBE but it is as likely that hersquoll have a knighthood by this time next year as it was unlikely four years ago that Michael Gove would now be Borisrsquos number two. I cannot name a Scottish news and current affairs show which Dr Leitch has not been on in the last week, and his easy manner together with his straight and simple answers will become an example of good practice for companies like mine which perform a media training service.Mr Brewerrsquos shows, of which I have often been a part in the studio, are usually characterised by meticulous positioning of guests and himself in order to keep everyone out of shot during the remote interviews on screen. Yesterdayrsquos was simpler, with Mr Brewer fixed in position as all three guests appeared from their living rooms.Dr Leitch has been a busy boy. He has appeared regularly on BBC Scotlandrsquos The Nine, a show whose well-documented problems stem, in my opinion, from scheduling rather than quality.That news was offset, somewhat, by the excellent show last Thursday where Rona Dougall took viewersrsquo questions directly to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, cominglive from Bute House.ITVrsquos Wednesday night Peston show is surviving, although only without the studio presence of its eponymous host Robert. Hearing Anushka Asthana open the show by saying ldquoRobert Peston is in quarantine was a rather eerie opening to a show whose magazine-style formatmakes it particularly dependent on having guests in the studio.Political TV addicts and contributors like me, and I believe the producers of the shows, should use this as a time for reflection. Those producers who insist on guests being in the studio are right to a large degree. Last weekrsquos shows are far the poorer for the presenters being in solitary confinement.That is not to say there is no place for so-called \"down the line\" appearances. Depending on the segment, being out of the studio can work better. It is a balance, which some understand more than others.However there is much more we could think about during this time of reflection to improve our political output. We suffer from a basic problem that our studios are in the wrong place producing political television while marooned  miles from the Scottish Parliament.So, for starters, Irsquod like to see BBC Scotland and STV make more use of their Edinburgh studios, perhaps on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when politicians are always in Edinburgh. This, at a stroke, would ensure that, in a post-coronavirus environment, presenters and contributors really can be all in it together.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-conversation-yes-campaigner-points-one-way","story":"The reason Irsquom saying all of this now is because of a conversation I had recently with a Yes campaigner. Yoursquoll know him: Alan Bissett. Hersquos a novelist, performer, and famous Falkirkian, and he was one of the leading figures of the  campaign and one of its most passionate agitators. Alan and I were talking to each other because of the plansto mark the th anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath, but the turn the conversation took was surprising. It didnrsquot go how you would expect.The thing is that, for a while now, a lot of Scots who lean towards the Union have felt like wersquore living in an age of conflict, and that the  referendum was partly ndash no, largely ndash to blame for that. But evenyou disagree with that premise, or the cause, you might still agree about where we are now: Yes versus No, Leave versus Remain, Salmond versus Sturgeon, the human race versus Covid-. Even the attempt to control the coronavirus is described in terms of conflict ndash we are at war, they say we are fighting an invisible enemy.But whattherersquos a dferent way of framing this and a new way forward  When we had our chat, Alan Bissett told me he was just as much a supporter of Yes in  as he was in . The No vote was a disaster, he said, and Scots find themselves trapped and buffeted without any control of their political destiny. Independence needs to happen sooner rather than later, he said. Itrsquos an emergency.But itrsquos what Alan told me next that was really interesting because I think lots of Scots feel the same way, eventheir actual views havenrsquot shted much. What Alan said was that, for him, a lot of the heat had gone out of the argument since . In the old days, he said, he wouldrsquove gone on the attack, but hersquos better now at listening to people with dferent views, and has more respect for them. He still argues the case for Yes, but he does it with less of an edge in his voice.Why has this happened  Itrsquos because Alanrsquos been mixing with dferent people. In , he was living in Glasgow and working in the arts and most of the people he socialised with were Yes supporters. But he has since moved to the country and lives in a small village where he comes into contact with a more erse range of opinion. Down the pubthere are going to be lots of unionists and this fact has changed the way Alan approaches things.The lessons hehas taken away from it all are interesting. Herersquos what he said to me: ldquoIrsquom talking to guys who might have very dferent opinions to me andyou start being too forthright about it, theyrsquore going to tell you to f*** off. Theyrsquoll probably see you as some a******* who comes into the pub and spouts off about Scottish independence. I canrsquot be that person. It doesnrsquot work. So itrsquos made me a better communicator and more reflective when it comes to politics. Irsquove got better at listening.Of course this doesnrsquot apply to everyone ndash just look at Twitter. The opinion poll at the weekend suggesting a big election win for the SNP next year also makes another independence referendum more likely, which will surely get the blood boiling just as much as it did in . But even so, for a lot of people, the passage of time, or a change of scene in Alanrsquos case, or the spread of an invisible virus, has made the debate feel much less aggressive than it was, and we should try to go with that. We should try to learn something from the moment of calm that some of us are feeling.I think Alan has already, and I hope I have too. One of the subjects we talked about was identity and how important it is to both sides of the argument over the constitution in Scotland. Alan said he was more aware, and respectful, of the fact that many Scots feel British and want to remain British. Itrsquos their identity, and the same works the other way round for Scottish nationalists: they feel attached to their identity and, letrsquos face it, even those who decry identity politics have an identity. We should all recognise and respect those facts.We can also do what Alan has done and pull back a little from the swing and punch of Yes and No. A good first step would be to come off Twitter, which Alan has already done ndash Twitter is merely fuel to the fury and is not the place for nuance or respect. We could also ndash when wersquore allowed to ndash socialise with a much more erse range of people, which Alan has also done. If yoursquore a Yes voter, make sure that your first post-Covid coffee is with a No voter and vice versa for unionists. And donrsquot just wait for them to stop talking so you can make your point. Listen.I appreciate some people will think all of this is naiumlve, but a more respectful conversation is more likely to produce a settled will that we can all go along with in the end and thatrsquos what we need. Obviously, Alan Bissett hopes the settled will is going to be for independence I hope itrsquos for the Union. But itrsquos more likely to be a broad agreement or a settled consensusit comes from a long, respectful, reflective conversation rather than a political punch-up. If we listen to each other and slowly move in one direction, itrsquos more likely to last. If we respect each other, we will respect the result. Irsquom going to try to remember that when I come out of isolation."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  How Coronavirus is exposing America   s weaknesses","story":"How could it not be with Donald Trump leading the coronavirus response  This is, after all, the man who only a few short weeks ago was playing the virus down iously as a hoax invented by his political enemies, a problem his government had ldquoclosed down and something that would ldquodisappear...like a miracle.This is also a man who stands on a  of hating science and experts, and whose utterances are weighed down by re-election.

And that means staying at home.#By doing that, every single one of us in this collective national endeavour is helping to slow down the spread of this virus, protect the NHS, and save lives.#And we are doing our bit, to get closer to the time when we get out the other end of this and can start to resume our normal lives.#So my sincere thanks again to everyone for your co-operation, and I hope all of you have the best weekend that you can in the current circumstances.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is actively being considered at a regional level.Although there has been considerable modelling done within the Trust to look at how we might maximise available critical care capacity within our own hospitals, it would be premature for us to say anything more at this point given that things could change very quickly.”The Trust is also prioritising its resources to support the most vulnerable in the community. This has involved reviewing all Domiciliary Provision with families to identy what care they are able to provide for their relatives in these exceptional and very challenging times. This should free up domiciliary capacity to focus on those who require critical care which cannot be met by any other means during this COVID- period.Commenting, Phil Hughes, the Trust’s Director of Community Care said:“We will work with families to arrange for contingency placements in care homes on a temporary basis for iniduals where there is concern that the level of frailty and risk would indicate that this is the most appropriate way to provide care during this period or where the current care arrangements are unable to be sustained.We are also working to increase capacity in the community or care placements within our own community hospitals and residential units, in addition to working with the care home sector.The stepping down of non-critical interventions is allowing us to free up capacity of community nurses, social workers, care staff and Allied Health Professionals.”The Trust has also been working in partnership with GPs in primary care to set up COVID- Centres as part of a network across the region to manage the increased incidence of Coronavirus cases in the community. New centres will open in Antrim, Ballymena and Coleraine and the emphasis will be on patient safety, staff safety and the provision of a sustainable primary care service.The new centres will not be testing facilities and will only be for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of having COVID- and require medical attention.

Linda Stewart speaks to three frontline staff who are staying away from their dwellings to protect their loved ones.The AE nurseAE nurse Ruth McGreevy , from Newtownards, has moved into an Airbnb accommodation in Bangor in order to protect her mum and siblings who fall under the high risk category. Her boyfriend is Philip , a computer technicianAE nurse Ruth McGreevy has had fond memories of the Ulster Hospital since childhood when she was a frequent visitor due to her asthma.Now on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus, the -year-old from Newtownards is poised for the toughest battle of her le as the hospital prepares for a flood of patients hit by coronavirus.Although patients infected with Covid- have already started to appear at the Ulster Hospital - and there have been some deaths - there is still a sense that it is the calm before the storm.We shut down a bit of the AE to cater for people coming in, where we could call people in and treat them, send them to the ward or send them home. And then the past couple of weeks we#ve been closing off more and more of the AE, Ruth says.We#re all very nervous. I don#t even think it#s about the people coming in - people are worried about taking it home Ruth McGreevy, nurseObviously, the doctors and the managers are concerned that it#s coming because they#re shutting it down and we#re getting more in-depth training on how to deal with the really sick patients that come in. So it#s a bit scarier now that all this is taking place - everyone#s on tenterhooks just waiting for this to hit.All the wards have been emptied out to deal with this when it arrives and it#s quite bizarre lately going to the ward and seeing lots of empty beds, because that hasn#t happened in years.The staff have been getting special training in the personal protection they will wear, including masks, aprons and gloves.And then there are things like infection control, how to stop the spread. We#re learning how to work ventilators and respiratory equipment, Ruth says.That#s quite daunting - nurses generally wouldn#t really be doing much of that, but now we#re being taught it just in case we get into the circumstances where we might have to use them.We#re all very nervous. I don#t even think it#s about the people coming in - people are worried about taking it home.We all have families at home and sick people and children and things. You#re so scared of walking it back into your house, because you never know what will happen. You hear of people getting younger and younger with no medical history who are dying from this, so it#s scary.Ruth has a long association with the Ulster Hospital - she was born prematurely and had bad asthma when she was young, and spent a lot of time in the hospital.I just had lots of admissions with my chest as I had quite a lot of asthma attacks, so I was just in and out with that into Maynard Ward. They were always so nice and kind and my sister Eleanor was quite unwell as a child, so we spent a lot of time visiting her when I was little - I was just always around hospitals.It was this early experience that spurred her to become a nurse.I was struck with just how much a bit of kindness can do for someone, Ruth says.You can be so unwell and someone just giving you a nice smile or being kind - the smallest gesture can go a long way. Making someone a cup of tea sometimes goes a lot further than any other medication you can give them. with her mum and sisters\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with her mum and sisters\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose with her mum and sisters\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with her mum and sisters\"Close family: Ruthwith her mum and sisters FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappClose family: Ruthwith her mum and sistersAfter leaving school, Ruth went to Queen#s University Belfast and worked as a healthcare assistant while studying to be a nurse. She is now an adult-trained AE nurse in the Ulster Hospital.Basically, it#s people walking in unwell, so it#s like doing bloods and ECGs, trying to figure out what#s wrong with people. Lately, I#ve been dealing with cardiac arrests and things like that, dealing with car accidents.Ruth lives with her mum Belleand sisters Sarah , Eleanorand Kirsty .In the past week she has been forced to make the dficult decision to move away from her family in order to protect them from the danger of infection.I#m the youngest, and I didn#t want to do it but my mum is , and she#s diabetic and has high blood pressure, Ruth says.My oldest brother Alex recently had four strokes and he was on chemotherapy treatment with quite an unusual disease that he has - nobody#s really heard of it. So he#s on chemotherapy and he would have quite a low immune system. My sister Eleanor has MS and my sister Kirsty is on immunosuppressant drugs for a stomach problem. I feel like a walking super-virus going into my house.I was thinking about it for a few weeks but I hadn#t really talked to my mum about it - I didn#t want to bring it up until I thought it was really necessary.But in the last week especially I noticed that a lot of the patients I#ve been looking after had been going off to the ward and were taken very unwell or there were people passing away. So, in my eyes I could see it escalating quite a lot and I felt like it was time to go. Ruth says her family was very upset that she had to move out. She was the youngest and had never been away from home for a long period of time.I#m only moving to Bangor - it#s not far but it#s more that I can#t come into the house and have a proper conversation with them, she says.My mum was very upset about it - she#s just worried. She keeps saying she might not see me again.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseTesting times: Ruth McGreevy in the Ulster Hospital FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappTesting times: Ruth McGreevy in the Ulster HospitalRuth keeps in touch with her family and her boyfriend Philip , a computer technician, using video chat.I haven#t seen him in a month, she says.Along with another nursing colleague, Ruth has moved into an Airbnb accommodation at Gray#s Hill in Bangor thanks to the generosity of the couple who own it.They#ve given us the use of their house completely rent-free which is amazing - it#s so kind, she says.The kindness we#ve been shown at the moment is immense - like every day there#s more things being sent off to us. We#ll keep laughing, saying we#ll be rolling out of here after coronavirus because people are feeding us so much.We#re getting pizzas and doughnuts, and a big coffee van was up the other day giving everyone free coffee and sandwiches and everything. People are donating hand creams because we#ve washed our hands until they#re cracking and bleeding - people are giving us everything.The toughest thing just at the moment is all the new training, Ruth says.They#re saying things are going to get a lot harder for us because obviously this disease is airborne, so it#s when we go into the big proper masks that it will be scary.You#re just aware that you can#t take them off, she says.It#s just the fear in people#s eyes because they#re not allowed any visitors. So it#s trying to comfort those people - they#re so unwell and scared, and they can#t have anyone in their family with them.All you can do is just try and be as kind and caring as you can, staying with them, explaining why it#s happening, why their family can#t come in, we#ll look after them the best we can. It#s just being there to hold their hands when they need it.Ruth pays tribute to all the staff who are doing their bit to combat the disease.It takes an army in here, she says.To move a single patient to the ward, the whole corridor has to close because obviously people can#t walk into the corridor when you#re moving - so the amount of porters it takes and then the whole area has to be cleaned after one patient moves. The amount of people it takes to move one person is crazy. And you couldn#t do it without everybody - the teamwork going on at the minute is amazing.I know the Down AE has closed, so the staff from the Down AE have just come up today to the Ulster. So that#s extra doctors and extra nurses coming up, which is great.Ruth says the whole thing is very scary but the key thing is to try to keep positive.It#s all going to be over soon hopefully andwe all just do as we#re told it will be over sooner rather than later, hopefully, and we#ll come out the other side, she says.It really does prove how great everybody is that works for the NHS, not just nurses. We#re being supported at the minute, but it really isn#t just us - it#s everybody. It#s amazing seeing everyone pulling together.The social workerSocial worker Maria McNamee , from Londonderry, has moved in with a friend in Castlefin, Donegal, because she is concerned about putting her partner Gareth at riskI live with my partner of  or  years - it#s just me and him, she says.He has two of the conditions that put him at a really high risk - he has type one diabetes and is on immunosuppressants for Crohn#s disease. Each one of those would have put him in the at-risk category but the two together complicate things a bit more.Over the weekend the couple discussed the risk and made the dficult decision that Maria should move out.Because I#m still working and I#m out and about in contact with people, we decided the risk was too high, she says.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseForced separation: Maria McNamee and partner Gareth FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappForced separation: Maria McNamee and partner GarethEven before I moved out we were practising a bit of social distancing at home - we had moved into separate rooms and we stayed in separate parts of the house.I really thought we could just continue to do that - we didn#t go out with friends, we didn#t have people calling.We genuinely thought this would have been OK but the more we learned about the virus and how it is transmitted, it was like a bang at the weekend.The dficult thing is not knowing how long it#s going to be for -someone said it would be for #X# amounts of weeks it would be easier, but it#s not knowing when I#m going back to my own environment Maria McNamee, social workerIt was a really tough thing to do and we just felt it had to be done.We made the decision over the weekend and I packed my bags and left for work on Monday morning, not toreally. The dficult thing is not knowing how long it#s going to be for -someone said it would be for #X# amounts of weeks it would be easier, but it#s not knowing when I#m going back to my own environment.It#s a bit hard for us doing it - I can#t even imagine what it#s likeyou have children.Maria has moved in with a friend in Castlefin and works from home quite a lot, but there are still days when she has to go to the office or carry out home visits.Even though the rest of my family are living locally I#m still not seeing them either, she says.As a social worker with the looked-after children service, much of Maria#s work involves visits to children, families and foster parents.We#ve stepped some of that down but we#re doing a lot of phone support and there are still children that we need to visit, she says.It#s a tough job, so when you don#t have your own home comforts around you and your own routine of what you do, it#s really tough.This is the start of it - it#s been okay and it#s a lovely place, but I can only imagine when you#re two, three, four weeks down the line, and that#s only the start of it.I think there#s a real sense of people getting on with it and you are having to dig deep - I think everybody is doing it. I am so lucky with what I have here - for others out there, it must be so hard for them.The paramedicParamedic Rab McCoy , from Coleraine, has moved into a BB to protect vulnerable family members from infection. He is married to Tanya and has two children, Robbieand Rachel It was really from a personal point of view - there were a couple of things, he says.It was a matter of timing for me, trying to gauge the timing for this curve that is talked about in the news.I realised early on that I couldn#t work from home.My we had had a couple of bouts of cancer and had undergone radiotherapy and chemotherapy and had her spleen removed, so it was a decision we talked about. It was a no-brainer.The paramedic was granted a period of emergency leave by the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service in order for him to prepare his family for his absence - including his elderly mother-in-law and his brother, who lives in semi-sheltered accommodation.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBetter times: Rab McCoy with we Tanya and their children Robbie and Rachel FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBetter times: Rab McCoy with we Tanya and their children Robbie and RachelI cleared all that up and that allowed me the time to prepare for stepping out of the home setting for an extended period of time.

Consequently, the media are also in his thoughts. Now, however, the Covid- survivor has become a medium himself. His live Facebook broadcast, during which he begged the Lord to heal our land of coronavirus, began on Monday evening at .pm - with the precise timing inspired by the Bible .I want to send out a message of hope, encouragement and thanks, he said. And I wanted to offer up prayers for the NHS, the doctors and nurses on the frontline, as well as other key workers including retail staff, for providing us with food, and pharmacies for ensuring we have medicine.I also prayed for teachers because they#re allowing NHS staff to go to work, and for the media for getting vital news about this virus out to the public.I want to unite Northern Ireland with a message of hopeEqually, I prayed for those who are self-isolating because they are on their own.It#s based on this verse from the Bible: #If my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from Heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land#.Pastor McClurg, who preaches at the Elim Church in Newtownards, where he lives with his family, said he intends to have a prayer broadcast all week.Every night on Facebook I#ll be praying and anyone who wants to can join in, he said.I want to unite Northern Ireland with a message of hope.But the father-of-three is not technically #working at home#.Since he left hospital, after a -day period during which he was critically ill, he has been self-isolating from his family at a friend#s house to protect his -year-old we and their three children - Liliannaand twin boys Josiah and Judah .Claire and I made the dficult decision that I would stay away for seven days, he said. I am an answer to a prayer. I#m alive and I#m one of the blessed onesYou can#t tell children they can#t hug their daddy and expect them to understand so this was the best thing to do.Glengormley native Mark fell ill suddenly without displaying any of the symptoms normally associated with coronavirus.When it took hold, however, it quickly sapped his strength, rendering him unable to breathe and fearing for his le.On Monday, he said he was grateful to be on the mend, adding that his survival was down to the excellent healthcare workers at the Ulster Hospital.I#m really happy that I#m home from ICU, he said.A couple of times I was convinced that I would never be well enough to leave hospital.I am an answer to a prayer. I#m alive and I#m one of the blessed ones.Some people who get coronavirus have mild symptoms - like a cough, headache and pains - but I was critical. I couldn#t breathe. I thought I was going to die a couple of times. I understand why people with underlying health conditions may struggle more with this disease. I#m ft  tall, a big, strong, fit and healthy strapping man who doesn#t drink or smoke and I ended up in ICU because it was dficult for me to breathe.Pastor Mark revealed that doctors and nurses from all over the UK have been in touch with him privately in recent days.They have been privately contacting me to thank me for reinforcing the message about social distancing and also for the gratitude and recognition I#ve given them for the work they#ve been doing for me and all the other coronavirus patients, he said.People in the Ulster Hospital have been in touch to say they looked after me while I was in the ward and I#ve been able to thank them personally for saving my le.

Unlike a normal loan the company can repay the loan at any point, and then draw more againneeded.

In the s, she was scouted by one of Americas biggest record labels and asked to name her price.She shared the stage with the likes of Stevie Nicks, Sheryl Crow and the Dixie Chicks, and rubbedshoulders with A-list actors.Noella is great at telling stories, and she has hundreds - living round the corner from Ben Affleck, hanging out with with Winona Ryder, and partying with Hugh Heffner at the Playboy MansionHer le in America was the stuff dreams were made of, with a critically acclaimed album, sold out gigs, luxury hotels and chauffeurs.But why didnt we know about about all this I didnt tell anyone, she shrugs.Probably because she didnt care you can see why the A-list fell for her, the beautul Irish girl who was deeply unimpressed by fame.The signs were there from an early age that Noella liked to do things her own way.She was asked to leave her local folk group aged  over creative dferences.I forgot my song book, but I didnt need it. I knew every song, she laughs, taking a drag of her vape.The teacher told me to go and get my book. I said, I dont need it and she said, Go and get your book and I said, Shove it up your arse.She came back looking for me, but I never went back.Derry was always going to be too small for Noella and at  she headed to London with her guitar on her back and gigs with the likes of Van Morrison already under her belt.There was nothing here in , she says.I would have done anything to escape.Not long after she arrived, The NoellaHuttonBand landed a residency at Madame JoJos, a legendary Soho strip club frequented by actors and popstars.Youd have people like Robbie Williams, theyd all come in there mincing about, says Noella.Before we went on wed be sitting in the green room with two totally naked strippers.But it was just normal. It wasnt a big deal. It was just work and they were so professional.Mariah Carey came in one night and she tried to move my friends from the front seats and I said, Naw, thats my friends there.She asked meI had a demo and I said naw. Honestly, I just didnt want to give her anything, she smiles.Boy George was another regular and after watching her play, he asked her to sign to his label More Protein.He said to me, No one has ever scared me before, but you scare me, she recalls.So, you signed with Boy George Naw.One of things he said to me was, So, youre a big dyke then That got my back up right away. I said George, my sexuality has got f**k all to do with what I am.Its such a small, small part of who I am.And its really nobodys business. It wasnt because I was ashamed, I just thought, Im not going to ride on the back of that honey.If he hadnthave said that, who knows  But it just wasnt meant for me.The pair still hit it off and Noella sang with Boy George at a string of gigs in Shepherds Bush Empire, dueting on a punk version of Karma Chameleon.They also enjoyed wild nights out together, where people used to confuse them for brother and sister.He was a good guy - very intelligent.And he loved me and he was so proud of me.Noella was having the time of her le, singing at Paul OGradys thbut still working at Camden Market on the weekends to make ends meet.She was hanging out with the likes of Oasis, Paula Yates and Michael Hutchence and the buzz around her was starting to grow.Then she got the call that would change her le.It was from the head of Radioactive Records who had signed the likes of Garbage and Debbie Harry.He asked me how much I wanted, I could barely afford to make it to the bus stop, she laughs.Radioactive asked Noella who she wanted to produce her album and she chooseJerry Harrison of Talking Heads, who had just produced for the American rock band Lives album Throwing Copper.The label flew her to LA to record it and soon she was living the American dream with a substantial advance and her own cab driver who was on call around the clock.I was just happy to be able to do stuff for people, she says.Sure whats the point of having money  You cant take it with you.Noella released her self titled album NoellaHutton in , toured extensively in the States and was put up in the likes of New Yorks Cha Hotel.I slept the best I ever have in my le when I was in New York, she says.It was just the characters. Everything.I felt at home there.Her husky, soulful voice was also in hot demand commercially and featured in ads for Lexus, Nike, Coca-Cola and Toyota.In  Noella played to , people at Canadian singer Sarah McLachlans Lilith Fair where she shared the stage with Nelly Furtado and Christina Aguilera.We had to do a press conference with Sky News, I just kept thinking Im a wee girl from Derry.Despite reaching such dizzying heights, very few back home knew was happening.I never told anybody, I just didnt think it was important, she says candidly.I dont think Im anything special, do you know what I mean I was just writing and playing and having a wee laugh. Thats very important. Youre only here for a wee while.Fame never interested me. It was terrying.I knew too many people who were miserable and had no le.I had too much badness to get up to.And what a le Noella was having. She was dating Taryn Manningand her album was No  on the playlist of the Virgin record store in Hollywood.She was living the kind of le most of us can only dream of, but her mental health was suffering and in  Noella suffered a complete nervous breakdown.Everything just crashed in my head at the one time, she says with characteristic frankness.It all closed in at the one time.I had just been putting it off my whole le.Everything that had went on reared its head.Id had a breakdown in London too, but this was on a dferent scale.It was just trauma. You think youve dealt with certain things. But naw, you havent.Im amazed that Im still here to be honest.Noellas sister, JeanetteHutton, brought her back to Derry, where she worked very hard to get better with the help of Gransha Hospital and the support of her family.A couple of years later she met American singer songwriter and producer Justin Black, who had her album as a teenager growing up in Arkansas.He said my album inspired him to play the guitar, she laughs.He didnt even know I was Irish.She also formed the band Blood with her sister Jeanette and brother-in-law Ruairi ODoherty and two years ago they released an album of the same name.Shes the eldest girl in the family and Im the youngest and all we do is laugh at stupid sh***, said Noella.Shes so loved. Shes brilliant. Shes my hero.In recent years Noella has also channelled her energy into animal rescue charity Friends of Rescue founded by her best friend Suzanne Fleming.Together with Suzanne, Keith Rutherford and Carly Russell, Noella helps rescue and rehome neglected and abused animals.The day before yesterday we rescued  dogs, she said.Its the most rewarding, heartbreaking, devastating, incredible all-encompassing thing.Im fearless when it comes to the well being of animals, children or old people.Noella is now sponsored by world-renowned bespoke guitar makers Emerald Guitars, who are based in St Johnston.Justin persuaded her to record her recently released solo album Love and Liars which deserves to be heard on the world stage, but Noella has no plans for a big tour.Ive honestly never made a plan in my le, she says.I dont believe in forcing squaresinto circles, do you know what I mean Its something that has to happenorganically, naturally.And this feels right at the minute.To find out more about Noella, visit her Facebook page The First Noella.Her music is available at noellahutton.bandcampA documentary about Noellas le, The First Noella, made by Justin Black is now available on YouTube.If you would like to support Friends of Rescue you can find them at Friends of Rescue Ireland on Facebook.For more information on Emerald Guitars visitwww.emeraldguitars googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You have that dark humour.In the book Joanne talks about her pregnancy with Hannah, which was fraught with dficulty as doctors thought she may miscarry again, due to an incompetent cervix.Terriedof losing her baby, she was put in six months of bed rest during the winter of .Their beautul daughter Hannah was eventually born safe and well, following a caesarean section.I had to have a section because she was breach from  weeks, recalls Joanne.The consultant told me thats what saved her from going the same way as Jacob.They said she was standing up in my womb holding on to my ribs.Joanne got pregnant again but the pregnancy was ectopic, a potentially le-threatening complication where the baby grows outside the womb.The baby couldnt survive and the couple were told there was no option but to end the pregnancy.The operation didnt go to plan and Joanne had to have one of her fallopiantubes removed and two blood transfusions.After I came back from surgery I was in recovery for hours and when my mammy saw me she got very emotional.She said I know you want to give Hannah a sibling but you are my child and Hannah needs her motherI said right Lawrence, Im not trying any more. We have to draw a line under it.It killed me.I could still have another baby, but I know mentally that I couldnt cope.Throughout her pregnancies Joanne had been keeping diaries of everything that happened.Ive always written, she says. Even before this book I always joked that I was nursing until I decided what to write about.I wrote a diary after Jacob and I still have it. I suppose its like the mood diaries we use in work so people can see they are getting better.I made a diary of my pregnancy with Hannah and then after she was born I was content and I thought this is great, Im finally a mammy.I loved being in that mammy role and all the funny stuff that happened and I decided I really should keep a diary of all this.Joanne sent her diary to friends who were living in America and Australia as a way of keeping in touch and gradually built up the confidence to show some work colleagues too.One girl at work has a sister who is a blogger The Red Duchess, and she told me I should share it as a blog.I had it all on my computer to show Hannah when she is older anyway so I did it and I thought sure this is lovely.It wasnt until she was forced to take three months off work after breaking her shoulder that Joanne started thinking about turning the blog into a book.She contacted local authors Claire Allan and Felicity McCall for advice and they gave her the confidence to approach a number of publishers.Despite receiving positive feedback, Joanne found the process a bit overwhelmingand decided to shelve the plans for a book to concentrate on her career.Around this time a promotion came up at work and Lawrence encouraged her to go for it.I thought it would be a wee challenge but I was sick nearly every day when I was studying for the interview, she admits.Doubts would pop into my head like well, you were s*** at pregnancy and stuff.I did the interview and it was horrendous. Afterwards I cried so much and I knew it wasnt right.I was always grand at interviews and I never let it get to me. But I was just so low and couldnt get past it.The post came up again and I thoughtI went to the doctors and got something to settle me for the interview I might have a chance.When I went to GP surgery there must have a pregnancy clinic going on and there were pregnant woman everywhere and I felt so emotional.Joanne was seen by a young doctor and explained why she was there, but after reading her notes and listening to her story the doctor told her she didnt think the job interview was the problem.She said Youve had  years of trauma trying to get pregnantShe said Joanne, youre a nurse - youve just bottled this up and done most of this yourself and this interviewhas just tipped you over the edge.Joanne got treatment for her anxiety and kept writing to help her process her feelings and also record all the happy moments with Lawrence and Hannah and her stepson Dylan.Last year, Joanne heard about Jude Morrow, a Derry man with autism who had self-published a book about parenting his son.Judes book was a huge success and climbing up the Amazon best sellers list, so she got in touch to see what he thought about hers.He was hugely encouraging and told her to self-publish,advising her to spend a little money getting a cover designed for the book and to have it professionally edited.Joanne says self-publishing was a journey into unchartered waters, but she had the help of her dad and her self appointed PA Harry McGarvey.Just last week Joanne finally got her hands on the first copy of her book Memoirs of a Mad Mammy, but it was a bittersweet moment because she couldnt share it with Harry who was self-isolating due to the threat of the coronavirus.I left it on the garden wall for him and he was up at the window giving me air hugs, says Joanne.Copies of Memoirs of a Mad Mammy can be pre-ordered now on Amazon.It is also available on Kindle and will be available to buy at Little Acorns bookshop in Derry. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He says: Journalists have played a vital role in recent weeks providing the public with factual information needed now more than ever.It is a sad irony that the threat to jobs in journalism is higher now than ever.The steep fall in demand for products of all sorts has seen advertising revenue plummet. Widespread lay-offs are threatened.This comes on top of a series of blows in the past few years. The NUJ has fought hard to protect members. But against a bleak economic background, it hasn’t been possible to prevent redundancies.The hammer-blow of the coronavirus pandemic has now put a question mark against the very future of a number of titles in Derry and Donegal, as well as across the rest of island. Journalists fear further loss of valued colleagues.Journalism dfers from many other industries in that workers tend to have a close relationship with the communities around them as well as with those they work alongside.Many people can be sharply critical of the local media, but at the same time value what they do. A community which loses a local ‘paper will be poorer as a result. googletag.cmd.push Some of our local papers are strong and will survive. But others are at real risk. It is for these reasons that the wider public, not just those who work in the media, should support journalists in striving to keep titles alive and save jobs in journalism for the next generation.Journalists are no more entitled to their jobs than anyone . But we do play a vital role, which has been highlighted as never before over the course of the coronavirus disaster.The NUJ is in talks with government in both Dublin and London about the need for support to see newspapers survive. It is reasonable to ask citizens in general, and their political and other representatives, to voice their support for the union as it tries to save valuable jobs and the valuable role which NUJ members play. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a letter to students and staff Professor Paul Bartholomew  Interim Vice-Chancellor said: Today, I would like to acknowledge those members of our estates operations and maintenance team who continue to undertake vital work on campus. On a rota basis they are carrying out essential statutory compliance works during this period of campus closures.  These ongoing works will enable the campuses to be re-opened promptly once the current restrictions are eased and will ensure the continued safety and wellbeing of our entire University community once weto campus le.  We are now beginning our second full week of online teaching and learning, and I appreciate that this has been a challenging time for our staff and student community. googletag.cmd.push Each one of us has had to find our way to a new normal, not only the pivot towards a new working paradigm, but also often balancing that with parental or other caring responsibilities. The health and wellbeing of our Ulster University team has been paramount in every decision we have made over recent weeks. It is clear that this commitment to you has been equally met with heroic and sustained effort to ensure the University continues to . Now, as the Easter break approaches it is important that we all take some much-needed rest and allow ourselves to recharge and recuperate after such an intense period. To support that, I am announcing  extraordinary days of University closure on Thursday th and Friday th April. I will not be sending emails or working on those days and I ask you all to lead your teams by example, to rest, to take this time to be entirely with your families and enable others to do the same. googletag.cmd.push I contacted you last week to advise that the University was reviewing summer  graduations, I am now in a position to confirm that due to the extensive COVID- restrictions now in place, the University has decided that it will not run graduation ceremonies in June. We appreciate that this is an important and treasured moment for graduates and their families and we are actively reviewing the options to run ceremonies later in the year once restrictions have been lted.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rosemarie and Sean Lynn from Dungiven tied the knot in a simple ceremony at St Columba’s Church, Long Tower after their original date fell victim to Covid-. The couple were married last Tuesday evening at :pm, just hours before government regulations banned weddings were due to be introduced. Rosemarie told the County Derry Post they were determined to go ahead with the ceremony. She said: “We got engaged in November and decided we’d get married on the th of April this year. googletag.cmd.push “A few weeks ago, our venue rang and said with coronavirus, they weren’t going to be open. “It was important for us to get married and have family and friends back at the house, so we brought it forward to Saturday the th of March.”  Boris Johnson and the British government had other ideas, however, and Monday’s announcement that weddings were banned left the couple ‘numb’. Things changed when Sean and Rosemarie rang their driver to inform him of the developments. “Brian, our limousine driver and he said: ‘Why don’t you ring the council and see what they can do ’ “So I rang and said we had the papers, we were getting married in the church and the priest was willing to marry us, but we needed the go-ahead from the council. She said to leave it with her. googletag.cmd.push “I was praying to St Anthony when the lady from the council rang back and said we had the go-ahead until  o’clock that night to get married.” The short time frame became even tighter as Rosemarie’s fianceacute Sean finished a sht as an emergency medical technician with the Ambulance Service. “Rosemarie rang and said: you’d better come home quickly because we’re getting married tonight,” said Sean. “I rang the duty control manager and was shocked when they gave the go-ahead for special circumstances. “I had to come home, lt the wean, scrub up quickly and get into the chapel. Of course, she was  minutes late.” Denied the luxury of time that most brides have to prepare for their wedding, Rosemarie was forced to improvise. She said: “I got ready, did my own nails, my own make-up, put the fake tan on, did the whole thing myself. “I had a wee dress I got last year that I just loved. It wasn’t even meant to be for a wedding, I just bought it because I liked it. “It felt like I was in a film. I wasn’t nervous, I was excited, but it was almost an out-of-body experience.” The couple’s faith was central to their decision-making, and both were delighted with the simple ceremony. Sean said: “I’m over the moon, I really am. “The big day would have been great to have, but the sacrament between me, her and God was the main thing.” “The ceremony was beautul,” said Rosemarie. “It was the two of us, the priest, two witnesses and Sean’s wee boy and we all had to stand six feet apart and sit six feet apart in the limousine because of the regulations. Although the couple were able to celebrate with a few drinks at Sean’s house, the honeymoon is on hold as he helps battle the threat of Covid-. He said: “We have a few days to spend together and keep le simple. I’m going out to C every day, so I’m glad for a few hours of something positive.” Rosemarie is hugely proud of her husband’s role. She said: “He’ll be back out in a few days saving lives, that’s what he loves to do. “He always was that kind of person who cares for people, and that’s what it’s all about now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Letrsquos look out for each other in these turbulent times.Cllr McMurray mdash who spoke ahead of Mondayrsquos ban on access to Tyrella beach mdash said that last weekend he had been ldquoinundated with messages and calls regarding the number of people attending local forest parks.ldquoUnfortunately, it appears that the general population is not adhering to the advice in relation to social distancing and I would suggest that they are nearly treating this crisis as a national holiday.I will be reviewing access to our forest parks with party leaders and senior management team, he said.ldquoWe have been pushing a lot of advice and guidance with regard to the need for social distancing but it is not resting with the population. It is so dficult to balance the need to allow people the space to walk to protect mental and health and well-being, but we ask that the public refer to guidelines set out by public health officials to do so safely.Cllr Lewis said the closure of leisure centres, play areas, council-owned facilities and schools across this district had been done for peoplersquos safety.ldquoI appeal to people to recognise why these areas are closed, he continued. ldquoPlay parks and sporting facilities should not be used. It is imperative that we recognise and accept the seriousness of this illness. It simply cannot be business as usual, we must heed all relevant medical advice.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThis is for our own safety, while also protecting the integrity of our health service and those vital, dedicated experienced staff who support it. Newry, Mourne and Down Council has taken extreme measures and please respect these steps. This isnrsquot a holiday and itrsquos not a jolly. We are protecting le.Cllr Gallagher said it was vital that everyone in the community ensures that social isolation is adhered to, highlighting the need to reduce the risk.He added: ldquoThe elderly and those with predisposed health conditions need to keep their distance and follow public health guidelines. Remain at homepossible and get someone to do your shopping. Family units are important. People must not allow others into their home and visits that are not essential must stopCllr Howell said that last week the Education Minister finally declared that schools would close to help prevent the spread of COVID-, highlighting the huge responsibility on parents to ensure that not just children are safe, but so are those they are in contact with.She added: ldquoUnfortunately, some young people think that this is the start of their summer holidays and they are free to continue with no worries or concerns. I am appealing to parents to inform their children about social distancing and the importance of adhering to the public health guidelines.ldquoIf your teenager goes out can you be confident that they will observe the required social distancing of two metres  Many of them donrsquot have the willpower to practice what is being advised.ldquoAs a parent I know only too well how hard it is to keep teenagers from going out, but we need to set the example to our children. If these social distancing rules are not adhered to, they will come home and unknowingly pass the virus to others, perhaps family members with underlying health issues or aged grandparents..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Pretend.jpg","title":"‘Pretend cough’ over credit union worker  ","story":"POLICE will be contacted after a saver in Downpatrick Credit Union ldquopretend coughed at a staff member last week during the coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed.Mary Cullen, chair of Downpatrick Credit Union, warned that it was now operating a ldquozero tolerance policy as incidents of verbal abuse to staff increased during reduced opening hours.She said the credit union, which is situated in Market Street, had been inundated with messages of support after she posted a warning post on Facebook last Friday where she asked members to respect everyonersquos boundaries regarding social distancing and to accept the new reduced hours cover.She said a member of the public verbally abused a member of staff before ldquopretend coughing at them.ldquoThis particular incident is not acceptable and going forward, unfortunately, Members who cannot be courteous to our staff will not be served, said Mary in her post.ldquoWe are in a very dangerous time and are doing the best that we can.

If people did go out, they were advised to keep two metres apart.Council officials say the latest closures are part of the organisationrsquos ongoing coronavirus response and that the decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with Public Health Agencyguidance.Last week, council officials had decided to keep Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park open and had agreed to waive the entrance fee to both facilities.

It may not be popular, but sometimes we need to take the tough decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, after the droves of people went to local parks and forests on Sunday, it appears people still arenrsquot taking the coronavirus issue seriously and are clearly flouting PHA guidelines.Cllr Owens added: ldquoThis is not a decision that Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to take as we had hoped that common sense may have prevailed. It was a decision we were forced to take and we must do all we can to stop the spread of this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 25%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Grand Cinema is to re-open in September, six years after it closed its doors.Workmen will move in shortly to give the cinema a pound, facelt and when the picture house is re-opened, it should be able to compete with the best in Ireland.That is the aim of Mr Harley Breen, the owner of the cinema, who this week outlined the work which needs to be completed before the curtain opens.ldquoWork is expected to take around six months and will involve completely refurbishing the inside of the cinema, Mr Breen explained.ldquoWe will be taking out all the seating and replacing it with a new type of seating, the most exclusive available.

He wrote: ldquoSo I turned with all my heart to the Lord My God...He protected me and he consoled me as a Father for his son...There is no other God...The Lord God said through the prophet, lsquoCall on me in the day of distress and I will set you free and you will glory mersquo.They said this is a reminder that ldquoGod truly is our shield in the stre.

The prime minister. Cabinet members.By Alex KaneMonday, th March , : pmUpdated Monday, th March , : pm\"\"A -year-old girl with no underlying symptoms. People in their s, , s, s, s and s. A man who was born in , when the Spanish Fly pandemic was sweeping the world. The fabulously wealthy. The poverty stricken. Brilliant academics.Covid- doesn’t give a damn. Not a single damn. Your background and location is irrelevant. If it can reach you it will strike you down: sometimes fatally, sometimes devastatingly – yet stopping short of death, sometimes not much more than a passing blow. And none of us has any certainty – even guesswork seems pointless – about which category we’ll fall into.Right at the start of the scare there was a view – no more than a form of urban myth, as it happens – that older people, + and maybe already regarded as ‘vulnerable’ in one way or another, would be hit hardest.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is self-isolating after contracting coronavirus, chairs a morning Covid- meeting \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting... Yet we soon discovered that the virus is no respecter of younger people, or those not regarded as vulnerable, either. As I’ve said, it doesn’t give a damn.I actually took some comfort from the fact that, a few months short of my th birthday, I was probably more vulnerable. Maybe not a dead cert , but certainly with less favourable odds than the others in my household Kerri, Megan Lilah and Indy. I’m certainly in no rush to shake the Grim Reaper’s hand anytime soon – I’m presuming he wouldn’t go in for elbow-rubbing, even now – butCovid- comes into our house I dread the prospect of one of the others dying while I survive. That would be truly unbearable.Maybe it’s because I’m in my mid-s, or an older dad with children, or because the present crisis has made me revisit and reflect upon the mistakes and missed opportunities in my past, or the fear of the virus, or maybe even a combination of those and other factors but I do find myself unexpectedly upset, even weepy right now. Sleep is dficult. Relaxing is dficult. Switching off and tuning out is impossible. Politics and politicians no longer interest me. Oddly, I’m finding a quiet comfort in The Chronicles of Narnia, which I’ve never read before. Brilliantly written and hugely inventive.I find myself watching the young blackbirds hopping around our decking and feasting on the cat’s food. They’ve got used to me and ignore me as I walk to and fro, often within inches of them. We still have a couple of robins very happy to sit right beside me as I dig through the soil. I lay in the hammock on Thursday lunchtime and listened to the noise: not of planes and traffic, but of glorious, wonderfully cheerful birdsong. We have a grey squirrel who visits our tree-house and vegetable-patch barrels. Last year I would have chased him. Today, I smile and chat. In one way this is all so matter of fact, yet in so many other ways it is extraordinary. All of this is, quite literally, happening in my own backyard. It’s like having a spacious outdoor extension where we can unwind, run around, play swing-balland bounce on the trampoline.As I say, very ordinary in one senseyet psychological le-savers right now. We are always able, in a very specic, very important way, to ‘leave the house’ and go outside. We don’t need to walk to a park, or drive to a beach, or find a hill to climb. Outside is through the kitchen door. And it’s there anytime and every time we want it either separately or together. We spend hours in it every day and Indy,  months, runs himself ragged.Believe me, I’ll never take the garden for granted again. I’ll never complain again about mowing, digging, cleaning-up, watering, leaf-clearing, dead-heading, weed-killing, fence-fixing or any of the other dozens of little jobs I always tried to avoid. At a time like this, we are blessed – and I mean that in the real sense of the word – to have the garden. When this is all over maybe the developers, planners and architects who specialise in urban projects will consider the importance of your own, everyday, outside space, to our collective mental health  Like everyone  I also find myself focusing on the what-s from my past and present and the ‘I wonder whats’I survive, or don’t survive. One firm decision has been made:I make it through to the other side of this crisis I will get all of my adoption files and background details and read them. I had wonderful adoptive parents in Sam and Adelaide, who provided me with the love, support, strength and supply of second chances I needed to have the le I have now. But I exist because of two other people. I hope I haven’t left it too late to find out about them. Whatever happened and for whatever reason I was placed in an orphanage the fact remains I still have a debt of gratitude to my birth parents. I wouldn’t be here without them. I’ve also begun a diary about what’s happening right now: the story of an ordinary family and how they coped in extraordinary circumstances. I don’t know whether I’ll ever get to finish it, but as a writer it would be absurd not to record as much as I can about what is happening at this crucial moment in world history. And precisely because these are extraordinary times it is important that as many of you as can, also keep a diary, or even just a notebook, about your own experiences, reflections, fears and memories. What is happening now is happening to all of us and that’s why the collective, personal stories must be saved and told.Finally, stay strong, stay safe, stay healthy. Be more patient with each other, particularly the children. The next few weeks are going to be really, really dficult, I fear. Best wishes to all of you.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Lurgan man Geoff Gates, who has created the Limitless weight loss programme, believes people shouldn’t use lockdown as an excuse to adopt a poor diet and exercise routine.He said: “The Limitless philosophy has always been that the only reason people get stuck in a rut is because of their limiting beliefs. If you feel good through proper nutrition and smart exercise, you will naturally be drawn towards better lestyle choices.”At times of great stress, for many diet often goes out the window. Geoff shared his advice on how to eat well during a crisis: “The issue here is we need to be not using food to combat stress but instead, tackle the stress head-on, that’s the first step. “I get all my clients to start practising meditation immediately. When I first suggest meditation to someone, they often wonderI’m joking or being serious. It’s not some hippy-dippy woo-woo thing, this is a proper prescription. They often report profound changes almost immediately.”Geoff said that having been overweight and depressed himself helped him to create Limitless: “There is gold in the depths of despair, and I count my experience as a blessing now. Without my personal struggle, I could never have developed the techniques to create the best weight loss programme in the world.”He said in terms of nutrition it was important to focus on quality food: “Broccoli is especially good for the lungs and its funny that it looks like a lung, just like walnuts a great for brain health they look like a little brain. As bizarre as this may sound, I believe our creator has provided us with clues.”Geoff said the current situation makes it even more important to make shopping lists, especially now that visits to the shops are meant to be limited. He commented: “There are always ways to make healthy food convenient food. We all own a freezer, so it’s just a matter of being a little bit smart and preparing ahead. “I advise my coaching clients to buy freezer bags then put all the ingredients together in the bag and use as and when they need them.”In terms of exercise he said: “I don’t think it’s been more relevant to use our time to focus on our health and fitness. The most used excuse I have heard continuously through my  years in the fitness industry was that people didn’t have time. Now we have an abundance of it. “So now you have plenty of time the next excuse will be that you don’t have the equipment. I refuse to hear it. “The simple truth is we don’t need gyms and never have needed them. The way I see it is the gyms have been a luxury, not a necessity. “The misconception is that you cannot get strong, fit and healthy without one – the truth being you can get the same results with just your good self, become your own gym.”He added: “If I was going to advise on one piece of home equipment it would be an adjustable set of dumbbells. He suggested a quickfire lockdown workout could include  bodyweight squats,  star jumps,  straight punches,  upper cuts,  push ups and  mountain climbers.He said those conscious of social distancing could exercise earlier to avoid encountering other people: “I have always got up at am to train so when I am out running in the morning, there is no one about. For me, being outside when no one is around is perfectly acceptable. We need fresh air.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

They’re not going to change their attitude.“They’re always making sure they don’t get themselves on the wrong side [of their] ideological view of how they deal with these things.”He also went on to say “we still have some civil servants who are in process mode” – meaning they are preoccupied with bureaucracy.“It is just yet another example of how dficult it is to operate in a five-party mandatory coalition because you’re always trying to balance a number of competing issues, concerns, opinions,” he concluded.He said it was like trying to ride the Tour de France “on a bicycle with square wheels and no brakes”.Sinn Fein and the Executive Office have both been approached for comment.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
