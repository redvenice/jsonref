The advice could be even more strict for the over 65s, the group most at risk of catching coronavirus in the first place and then dying from complications.         A passenger wears a surgical face mask as they use the Underground system in LondonA Whitehall source said the final decision over whether to switch to a strategy of trying to delay the spread could come as early as today.Schools are unlikely to be told to close however – despite measures taken by Italy and Japan – as ministers are worried about the impact on the economy, the NHS and pupils’ exams.The Department of Health is expected to publish separate guidelines for the elderly within the next few days which will explain whether or not they need to avoid public places or even hospitals. Many elderly patients attend frequent outpatient appointments or rely on social care visits, making them very susceptible to becoming infected.But yesterday’s surge in cases has raised speculation that patients are being treated in ordinary NHS hospitals, rather than in one of four specialised infectious disease units. Until now, anyone with coronavirus had been sent to one of four High Consequence Infectious Disease Centres, Guys and St Thomas’ and The Royal Free hospitals in London as well as The Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospitals and the Newcastle University Hospitals. These have only a limited number of beds and may already be full up.What is particularly concerning about yesterday’s new cases is that at least three of them caught the virus within the UK, they had not travelled to hotspots in Italy, China or Iran for example.Professor Whitty said yesterday it was ‘likely’ the disease was being transmitted in the community and being passed from ‘person to person to person. At this point in time we think it is likely – not definite – that we will move into onward transmission and an epidemic here in the UK’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme."},{"url":null,"title":"Kim Jong Uns sister Kim Yo Jong calls South Korea frightened dog","story":"Share this article She only said: \u0027The South side\u0027s response is so regretful and disappointing but it is somewhat fortunate that it was not direct statement of the president.\u0027South Korea\u0027s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said it has no specific comment on Ms Kim\u0027s statement.But spokesman Yoh Sang-key said the two Koreas should maintain mutual respect while working toward establishing a peace on the Korean Peninsula.Earlier Tuesday, state media said leader Mr Kim supervised a live-fire rocket artillery exercise in an apparent reference to the two suspected short-range ballistic missile launches detected by South Korea\u0027s military a day earlier.

It sucks up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as it grows, then spits it out as lovely lengths of golden timber, ready to use for everything from eco-friendly buildings to biodegradable paper straws and cardboard cups. It is nature’s wonder material, produced in an endlessly renewable, reusable and recyclable stream of green goodness. Right?Not so fast, say the designers behind the Serpentine Gallery’s new exhibition, Cambio. The forestry industry is not quite as squeaky clean as the timber trade associations would have you believe, nor are paper and cardboard products necessarily the carbon-negative alternatives they claim to be. In the ethical maze of responsibly sourced materials, it seems we can’t always see the cost of wood for the trees.Andrea Trimarchi and Simone Farresin, the Italian duo behind Amsterdam-based design studio Formafantasma (meaning “ghost form”), have shone their aesthetically pleasing spotlight on the global dynamics of the timber industry to encourage us to see the material afresh. Marking the first chapter in the Serpentine’s new foray into curating design in addition to its established programme of contemporary art, the exhibition attempts to draw the worlds of science, conservation, engineering and policymaking together in a research-driven show. The results are mixed, with some provocative ideas emerging from a display that has the overall feeling of browsing an Aesop concept store – with wafts of artificial tree scent to match.One of the first things you encounter is a teetering totem pole of Ikea stools, the £20 Bekväm, reliable provider of kitchen steps and houseplant stands to countless homes around the world. Formafantasma have remade the stool in seven different kinds of wood, from oak to chestnut and cherry, and stacked according to how long the tree grew before it was logged, and how much carbon dioxide it stored in the process.“The furniture industry’s mass production model is based on the constant renewal of the source material and disposability of the item,” say the designers. “But for wood products to be truly sustainable, they need to have a service life that is at least the same length of time that it took for the tree to grow.” Want the stool in walnut? You’d better plan on keeping it for 120 years.Nearby, a pair of tables piled high with disposable paper and cardboard products tells a similar story. There’s a smallish pile of reinforced envelopes, a fair stack of paper towels and a couple of towers of takeaway containers and paper cups. The work is titled 5 Years, the amount of time it will take a single pine tree to reabsorb the same amount of carbon dioxide released when each pile is discarded. The sight of just a few cardboard boxes equating to five years’ worth of arboreal labour might make you feel a bit queasy about all that Amazon packaging you dutifully put out with the recycling every week.Despite the number of international conventions in place to curb illegal logging (dutifully printed out and drily displayed on tables), it seems we haven’t come too far from the 19th-century thirst for exotic tropical hardwoods, shown in all its colonial ostentation at the back of the gallery. Trimarchi and Farresin have raided the archives at Kew Gardens and collected a handsome haul of timber specimens, which were originally shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851, just across the park. Marvel at the great polished slice of a mahogany tree trunk brought back from British Honduras, or the jet-black obelisk of Ceylon ebony, advertised as being “used in turnery for fancy articles”.The clue is in the name: Kew’s treasure trove of exotic timbers is known as the Economic Botany Collection. As Serpentine curator Rebecca Lewin says: “The display of tropical hardwoods was intended to encourage designers to be inspired by this vast catalogue of potential materials coming from the colonies – the message was to use more of them.”Trimarchi and Farresin are keen to point out that such a sensibility lingers. In an accompanying video, they show how modern digital rendering programmes such as KeyShot include a bounty of rare and endangered woods in their materials libraries, so designers can specify illegal timber, unknowingly, at the click of a mouse. “Digital tools can be used to simulate finished objects,” say the duo, “and perpetuate the myth of an endless supply of materials.”Which is ironic, given that Formafantasma are guilty of a few myths and half-truths of their own. Some elements in the show – like a spotless wooden palette – aren’t what they purport to be, but have been remade to look the part. All the shelving and furniture, said to be cut from a single pine tree that was blown down in a storm in Italy, has been slathered with such a thick coat of synthetic lacquer that it looks more like plastic such quantities of toxic varnish surely cancel out the benefit of salvaging the wood. Then there’s the scent of freshly sawn timber, which is actually a fake smell developed by a Norwegian smell artist and pumped through the gallery. The show can’t escape an overall sense of preciousness, as if the rough splinters of the real world have been sanded down and polished out of existence. The effect is reminiscent of Formafantasma’s recent Ore Streams project, which entailed some interesting research into the murky world of recycling electronic waste, but resulted in a range of luxury aluminium office furniture decorated with computer parts, for sale through their gallerist – which the Serpentine furniture will be, too. Farresin and Trimarchi are interesting thinkers, but the commercial reality of operating in the design-art world means their products are ultimately high-end collectibles with the sheen of an environmental message to give their buyers a warm eco-glow.• Formafantasma: Cambio is at the Serpentine Gallery until 17 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa6d8f5eab72c2486dd6ccccbabacf3ac88b4f7/0_583_5906_3543/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f76febd88d6c4d9ae8f32dc4abc3c81","title":"rene groebli the magic eye in pictures","story":"From spinning dancers to scandalous honeymoon images, the Swiss-born photographer’s work has been experimental, innovative and poetic for over six decades • René Groebli: The Magic Eye is at Bildhalle, Zürich, until 21 March.

He could just as easily have called it “Our Town”, since it is Gentleman’s vision of the city – its thoroughfares and dead ends, soaring towers and medieval muddle, wild parts and built bits – that has done so much to shape our common understanding of the place. You don’t even need to be a citizen or a visitor to have absorbed Gentleman’s vision: his distinctive postage stamps, which so often feature the city’s sights, have been responsible for communicating London, or rather London-ness, to millions of people around the world.Gentleman’s ability to make public art that nonetheless works on an intimate, human scale, was nurtured at the Royal College of Art under Edward Ardizzone, Edward Bawden and John Nash in the early 1950s. An early sketch of his of a City of London bombsite is as interested in the self-seeding plants in the foreground as it is in the distant medieval church and the crane that looms between them. Or consider the murals Gentleman made for Charing Cross tube station in 1978. Working in his much-loved medium of woodcut, he devised a 100-metre frieze telling the story of how medieval craftsmen built the original cross of the station’s name. Scaled to their full human size, the tunicked stonemasons and hooded sculptors appear to push their wheelbarrows straight into the platform scrum of modern office workers until past and present collide in a kind of street theatre.Zigzagging across time is also a signature of this book, which ranges from what Gentleman calls his “studenty” work to watercolours he made a mere month ago. We are reintroduced to all those covers he did for Penguin Shakespeares in the 1970s, which shaped several generations’ introduction to the plays. And then there’s the wonderful 1956 poster “Visitors’ London” for London Transport, a joyous jumble of busbied guardsman and cockney flower sellers, which sent a signal to the rest of the country that the postwar capital was fully open for fun.Alongside all these images, beautifully reproduced here on thick, creamy pages, Gentleman includes fascinating glimpses into his practice. He writes that watercolour remains his favourite medium, its washes perfectly suiting the light, fleeting feel of so much of his work. This is perfectly apparent in his image of Old Billingsgate Market and Custom House where the riverside outline is sketched in ink and then filled in with soft, smudgy blues and greys refracted from the Thames. What might in other hands have been overbearing and monumental – historic buildings always seem to trail their own offputting swagger – becomes instead fresh and even provisional, as if artist and viewer were together encountering the view for the first time.Not that there is anything sentimental or softening about Gentleman’s work. Much of his material concerns the streets around his Camden home, and he is unflinching about the beer cans and the drug dealing, not to mention the ugly street-branding that has changed the area beyond all recognition. When he moved in 60 years ago, the place really was artisanal (the word meant something: people made things by hand, from pianos to pie and mash). Now it appears bland and déraciné. But Gentleman believes in acknowledging the crassness and giving it a place in his work: “Irritating or even deplorable developments still make good subjects – you needn’t like what you draw.” To prove the point he includes images of diggers ploughing up the ancient green spaces around Camden for HS2, “a railway line which may never materialise”. Recalling his earlier sketches of cranes rebuilding the postwar city, the effect is neither nostalgic nor crude, but simply a clear-eyed sense that this is where we are now.There is a modesty about Gentleman’s work: it neither shouts, nor insists on being the centre of attention. It has, after all, often been made in the service of something else – a book, an amenity or, in the early days, a product (Gentleman cut his teeth in advertising in the 1960s before the ethics of it began to trouble him). In that sense what he does is applied art – at the RCA he was enrolled in the illustration department rather than painting. But it would be foolish to think for a second that this is somehow a lesser designation. The artist, who will turn 90 this week, describes what he does as “singling out an object from the rest and concentrating on it”, and it is a fine exercise to try yourself. You don’t need to be anywhere near London to respond to Gentleman’s urgent suggestion that we look harder at what’s right in front of us.• My Town by David Gentleman is published by Particular (RRP £25).

Paying a bill should be the first thing you do in the morning, whatever size business you are.”But it would be nice not to have to think about it at all, he adds. “My business isn’t chasing invoices.

Yet many will be using platforms and tools that already incorporate AI – anyone doing a Google search, for example, is experiencing it in action. “You can be sure there isn’t a human sitting in a cubicle, sifting by hand through the entire internet to decide which search result to serve you,” says Cassie Kozyrkov, chief decision scientist at Google.This technology is most often used by businesses in three different ways: automating processes (such as timed newsletter sends, or bank account reconciliation), data analysis to gain insights (and then performing tasks such as recommending products to customers), and engaging with the public (via customer service chatbots, for example). Much of this has been made possible by cloud computing (a way of storing data remotely), which has given smart platforms powered by the cloud millions of anonymised users’ data to learn from and adapt accordingly. It’s rapidly accelerated the development of tools that are simple for small business owners to use but highly effective in terms of eliminating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and enabling sustainable growth.‘It’s important to have a clear mind’“What beekeepers really like is the 88-million-year-old technology that bees use to do all sorts of smart things, like organise their hives, and produce wax and royal jelly from their bodies,” Dale Gibson, co-founder of Bermondsey Street Bees, says about introducing the art of beekeeping to technology. “The last real technological discovery in beekeeping was in America in 1852.”While respecting that heritage, Gibson has been able to incorporate technological development into his business in a number of ways, since installing his first hives on his London roof in 2007. “I do start off with a proper, gummed up, sticky with honey notebook, where the data is gathered in the field,” he says. “But when I come home, I enter that information into a system on the cloud where my associate beekeeper can look it up.” He’s also working on a pilot programme with the World Bee Project to test remote monitors that track the health of hives, such as their weight. That data is then fed back into a central system, shared by 32,000 beekeepers across more than 150 countries. The project hopes this information will help to create more sustainable ecosystems and improve global food security.Gibson is also exploring the potential of tracking his honey via a blockchain system, first trialled by the technology company Oracle at the 2019 OpenWorld show in Dubai. “Anything that can help us distinguish between real, raw local honey and the manufactured commodity that’s come from halfway around the world and been blended, heated and mashed up, then that’s a good thing,” says Gibson, adding that honey is the third most tampered with product in the world, after milk and olive oil.While technology can sometimes be daunting for SME owners to incorporate, he says it’s given him more time to focus on the bees. “We’re massively assisted by having Xero on our phones too so we can use it for inventory record keeping, invoicing and statements at any time and anywhere,” he says. He finds the automatic reminders to customers that an invoice is due (or late) particularly helpful, as is the functionality that automatically reconciles his bank statements. “Even though you’re running a small business and lots of things can happen, it’s really important to have a clear mind.”‘We’re trying very hard to make online successful’Since starting in 2011, Papersmiths has grown from a two-employee interior design studio in Bridport, to launching an additional chain of five stationary shops. The company now employs 25 staff and has a presence in some of the UK’s most desirable retail locations (including Bristol, Brighton, and Chelsea in London).Smart technology has played a clear role in the business’s growth, co-founder Sidonie Warren says. The majority of their data is tracked using point-of-sale software Vend, which integrates with Xero. “That’s excellent because it allows us to track what we’re selling, right down to a specific product or colour,” says Warren. “When we open a new store we use that data to figure out what it is we need to buy, and also planning the fit out of the store.” Shop managers also use it to identify that week’s top five products, and arrange displays accordingly.Building the e-commerce arm of the business has been a key focus for Warren recently. “Our challenge is translating that thing of testing a pen or feeling the paper of a notebook into the digital realm,” she says. Automating email sends via Mailchimp has enabled her to engage new customers via discount codes, and she can target people known to be top spenders at certain times of the year using sales data from Shopify.She uses Xero weekly to plan cashflow, as well as process payroll and track all of her staff expenses. She still uses the personal touch – if a customer is late paying an invoice for example, she’d rather call than send an automatic reminder – but is open to integrating new technology in the future, including an online customer service chatbot, and some sort of retail mapping system. “With online you can see how many times a product gets viewed but it’s very hard to do that in store,” she adds.‘We’ve grown substantially and it’s all down to being in control of our finances’Richard Fishenden worked as a farrier fitting horseshoes before he started Made by the Forge in 2006. “My wife went into a local shop that sold curtain poles and I was horrified at the prices. I said bollocks to that, I’m going to make them myself,” he says. The range has since extended beyond bespoke curtain poles, to other wrought iron homeware items.Fishenden says he used to be “archaic with technology”, but has managed to automate processes in various areas. “Xero seems to be the central part of the spider’s web that everything else feeds from,” he says. That includes an order system, where delivery notes and worksheets are generated so staff know what products to make a customer relationship management system for customer data that Fishenden uses to send quotes via Xero, and then follow up on leads that were once buried in paperwork and Receipt Bank for invoices and receipts that he says has saved hours of data inputting.Sign up to Xero here with a free trial"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f60924ffa07644519b058ca10fefa265d494ed/0_41_3761_2256/master/3761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=944deb0e2b40688d5181cef3ce38120b","title":"even as behavioural researchers we couldnt resist the urge to buy toilet paper","story":"Our own reaction came as a surprise but with further thought, the behaviour is largely explainableIf you asked someone how much toilet paper they have in their home right now, I’m sure they could accurately tell you.Did we ever think we would see a day when supermarkets would impose buying restrictions on toilet paper? It seems ridiculous, right? But the past few days have seen nervous customers panic-buying essential items such as toilet paper, canned goods and rice, leaving supermarket shelves bare. Some stores have even sold out of pet food and kitty litter.As two behavioural scientists, we’d both heard about toilet paper being sold out but largely dismissed it as a passing anomaly. But upon visiting a local supermarket, sure enough, the shelves were empty.Neither of us had intended to get caught up in the hype but then asked each other ... if there was a packet left or if we happened to be there when they were restocking the shelves, would we have bought additional toilet paper? Of course we would. Why? Despite studying behaviour for years, our own reaction came as a surprise, especially since we both still had at least a week’s worth in our respective houses.But, with further thought, the behaviour is largely explainable (behavioural scientists are very good at explaining behaviour after the fact!):It’s seen as an essential product, without ready substitutes. In many ways, toilet paper is similar to essential services. Imagine that the water utility told you they were cutting off the water in your neighbourhood for an undetermined period. I’m sure there’d be a surge in water tank sales and that baths, sinks and buckets would be filled.Toilet paper is easily stockpiled and doesn’t deteriorate. It’s relatively a low costlow risk investment and even if you have stockpiled, it’s something you will eventually use. Given we’re aware of people in quarantine for two weeks or longer, it makes sense to stockpile non-perishables in case this happens in Australia.In light of the first two reasons, buying toilet paper is an action that people can take now. The media (especially social media) may have made people feel helpless about the imminent arrival of Covid-19.The virus has all the characteristics that make it scary – it’s novel, invisible, we have no control, we are involuntarily exposed to the risk, it makes us feel dread and we are personally vulnerable. As box ticking goes, this one is right up there.While there is some guidance on what iniduals can do about it (thorough hand washing and avoiding people), the media reminds us continually of the relentless path. Buying toilet paper alleviates some of this anxiety and helps us regain control.Social media amplifies the fear which, in some way, seems to travel faster than the virus. The hashtags #toiletpapercrisis and #toiletpapergate were trending on Twitter. Seeing image after image of empty shelves sends signals to the public that this is an important issue everyone is talking about. What’s key to understand here is that media typically serves as a surveillance function, alerting us to risks that we need to shield ourselves from. The supermarket shelf itself also sends signals. Toilet paper is bulky and, as it’s removed, the shelves look empty quickly, which triggers the perceptions of scarcity. In reality, the situation appears worse than it actually is.We psychologically respond to scarcity. We hate missing out so when things are rare, particularly things we need, we chase them. Emotions can play a powerful role here. We’ve all been in a situation where we’ve missed out on something we thought we should buy, and felt remorse. In behavioural sciences, this is known as anticipated regret and, if you can get people to feel it, it’s a powerful motivator. By making the purchase, in some small way we protect ourselves from this feeling of regret.Humans are finely attuned to monitoring what everybody else is doing (even subconsciously). Most of us use “what other people do” as a mental shortcut to decide on what the appropriate behaviour would be if we are unsure. It’s a simple decision mechanism called “social proof heuristic”, a concept popularised by psychologist Robert Cialdini. For instance, we litter more when the surrounding environment is littered, because it signals to us that littering is the norm. Hotel guests are also more likely to reuse their towels if told that “the majority of guests reuse their towels”. So, when we see people stockpiling toilet paper, the natural reaction is to do the same. Social proof can help decide how to act, or reassure us that we are taking the right action.We use this same principle of social proof when judging risk. Think of a situation where you hear an alarm go off. Most of us will instantly look around to see what others are doing, and to decide whether this is something to be taken seriously. If everyone reacts then we will tend to do the same.Experts and governments have been telling us about pandemic preparedness, we’ve been urged to prepare as the widespread message has been that health systems across the world will struggle to cope. Everything gives the signal to prepare. So is anyone surprised when we see people panic-buying essentials?There are at least three factors driving our response – scarcity, social proof, and regaining a sense of control. It’s scary how strong these influences are on our behaviour. Stockpiling is not needed, yet we still have the urge to do it. As behavioural researchers, we intimately know the forces acting on us, yet we’re helpless to resist them.• Professor Liam Smith is the director of BehaviourWorks Australia, Monash Sustainable Development Institute• Dr Celine Klemm is a research fellow at BehaviourWorks Australia "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6905a0499964ceba2703c3e4a93a64aeda82454/0_328_3128_1877/master/3128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9492f12f3af5ddd0ed74d3e2e1227287","title":"no you wont get the coronavirus from chinese food and dont drink bleach","story":"Anxiety is understandable but panic responses – like stockpiling toilet paper –will only hurt your vulnerable fellow citizensMuch to his family’s dismay, my elderly cancer patient, a retired chef, now cannot stand the sight of food. His wife frets at the standard of her cooking, no matter how much I reassure her that it’s not her, it’s his body, slowly winding down. But there is one thing that his eyes still welcome. Even though he eats “less than a baby”, he loves the sight of spaghetti, comparing the deliberately overcooked strands to silken threads sliding down his raw mouth.I have convinced a devoted wife who would serve him a degustation menu at every meal that a small serve of pasta drenched in meat sauce will satisfy his modest requirements. Yes, it’s OK to have the same meal three times a day, if it’s either that or nothing.This week, we ran into an unprecedented roadblock. The local grocery store has run out of pasta. So has the one up the road. About to turn 90, she no longer drives. They don’t deliver phone books anymore and she doesn’t know how to google. Who still has spaghetti? Will the shops also run out of meat?“The hospital doesn’t sell pasta, does it?” she asks hopefully. I am simultaneously exasperated and embarrassed.The next patient is a woman with an intellectual disability who has mild viral symptoms. Her elderly parents have brought her in for her annual check and she looks unusually worked up. It turns out that her parents have similar symptoms and she is fearful that the whole family will be “locked up” in hospital because they may have the coronavirus. My reassurance that she has no risk factors for the virus probably fall on deaf ears because she suddenly wails, “And if we’re all here, who will care for my cat? Will you call my neighbour? I love my cat.”I realise that the biggest favour I can do everyone is to bundle her home as quickly as possible to be reunited with her pet.As an oncologist I witness any number of crises, but I can’t help thinking that, given what we currently know about the coronavirus in the Australian context, our self-induced panic is hurting our innocent and most vulnerable fellow citizens.Dry and long-life foods are flying out of the supermarkets. So are toilet paper, hand sanitiser and face masks. Photos of stark shelves are being circulated in surprise and jest.Elsewhere, those in search of a quick profit are snapping up items to hawk them online and families are lining entire spare rooms with storage shelves.Yes, it’s a free country, I know. And, store limits on toilet paper aside, if you want to deplete the grocery shelves, there is no law saying you can’t. But this is also a country of enormous wealth that is a net exporter of food with a stable government, a civil society, and a universal healthcare system that is (again) admirably rising to the challenge of providing clear, calm, sensible and truthful information as it unfolds.Australia is not China, which damningly withheld evidence of the coronavirus from its own citizens. It is not like countries that said they simply didn’t have any cases although authorities thought this highly improbable.And it is not the United States, where in an election year, unbelievably, a virus has become a political weapon. We should appreciate all those who are lending their expertise in a rapidly evolving environment without care for personal glory but let’s also acknowledge that they cannot script inidual behaviour.Stockpiling masks or using them routinely is unnecessary and they are much better reserved for those who need them, including health professionals and sick patients. Washing hands with soap and water is highly effective there is no need to hoard hand sanitisers. Bottled water is redundant, as is a garage emptied of cars and filled with food. Experts strongly recommend getting the flu shot as the influenza and coronavirus seasons may peak together in winter.Who should we listen to during a health crisis? In a country blessed with one of the finest healthcare systems in the world, I’d pick health experts, professional bodies and the government over social media every time. While social media has democratised medicine, it has also provided a platform for those spreading hoaxes, inaccuracies and plainly unconscionable gossip.No, you cannot contract the coronavirus from an “Asian-looking” doctor. Or from eating Chinese food. And please, please, don’t drink bleach to rid yourself of the virus, the “cure” being more fatal than the disease.But it’s easy to appreciate how, in trying to differentiate fact from fiction, many people just check out and what we end up is a miseducated and disempowered general population, when the best thing we can do as a society is to equip ourselves with knowledge. The coronavirus outbreak is causing understandable anxiety but unjustified panic. We can do better by our fellow citizens.I had never contemplated “mateship” until I came to Australia, but I thought it a fitting term to embody the spirit of a nation. The idea greets us in wonderful ways: when city dwellers weep at the devastation of bushfires when we honour a Vietnamese refugee as our governor when we celebrate Eid and Diwali with the same enthusiasm as Christmas and Halloween.Australians like to think of themselves as people with big hearts and open minds. The world knows us for the same things. This is a perfect time to be altruistic. In fact, to live up to the grand idea of mateship might take something rather ordinary. Don’t buy all the pasta. Don’t use all the facemasks. Save some toilet paper for others. There are people who need these things for sustenance and those who live in “the lucky country” should spare a thought for the luckless.• Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

Let’s invest in books insteadWorld Book Day is upon us, and primary school classrooms across the country are filled with overexcited, undersized BFGs, Mary Poppinses and Gruffalos. Meanwhile, parents will be arriving at work frazzled and smeared with facepaint. Because as we all know, despite the very best efforts of its organisers, World Book Day isn’t principally about reading – it’s about dressing up.There is no disputing that kids love it. No sooner is it over than mine start planning next year’s costumes – their ideas are always insanely overambitious, and usually only tangentially related to books. Has Sonic the Hedgehog ever appeared in print? Could I perhaps construct his spiky blue head using egg cartons? These are the questions I find myself grappling with approximately 15 minutes before we need to leave for school. One year I was sure I would have to cut a Willy Wonka hat out of my son’s hair at the end of the day, as we hadn’t allowed any time for the glue to dry.Of course, an impressive number of parents do manage to spend hours lovingly hand-crafting costumes. (Generally they have reception-aged children, and haven’t yet worked out the life hacks needed to avoid this kind of thing. Guys: invest in an all-purpose pair of glasses. As long as you have a Sharpie and can approximate a lightning strike – bingo!) Last year I was particularly impressed by the boy who came to school dressed as a giant atlas, complete with geographically accurate maps. Still not sure how he managed to sit down, though.Such heroic parental effort is not, alas, always fully appreciated by the kids. One friend spent ages last year putting together a brilliant Gangsta Granny costume, only for it to be discarded, swag and all, at the school gates (the wig was too itchy).Of course, as a booky person I am fully in favour of any initiative aimed at turning kids on to reading. With 800 libraries having closed down since 2010, and attention s dwindling at an alarming rate, books need all the help they can get in the multimedia age.I do, however, have a problem with the fact that World Book Day has become yet another opportunity for supermarkets to flog fancy dress to well-intentioned, time-poor parents. The internet overflows with “World Book Day special offers”: cheap, polyester Elsa dresses (hello, Frozen is a film) and Dennis the Menace jumpers (OK, for the sake of a quiet life let’s allow a comic). Many of these will be worn once, and then spend the next couple of decades mouldering in landfill.Grownups, let’s try to remember, today of all days, that reading is not an end in itself. We read in order to become more conscious of the world outside our own narrow experience we read in order to think more deeply. The attitude of a reader is the very antithesis of the rapacious, selfish short-sightedness of late-stage capitalism.

In reality it was made by someone who was clearly skilled in their craft around 1,000-800BC. “The skill and care with which it has been put together is remarkable,” he said. “It is just exquisite.”It comes from a period that is often misunderstood, associated with people living in huts or caves. Wilkin said that was understandable. “This is a subject, a period, that hasn’t been taught in school curriculums until very recently … I didn’t learn about it at school.”The pendant is decorated with semi-circles and geometric motifs, and on one side is a stylised solar design, reflecting the importance of the sun and its path across the sky to bronze age farmers.That depiction of the sun is seen in famous objects as the Trundholm sun chariot in Copenhagen and a small number of gold pendants found in Ireland, “but we haven’t really seen it on British objects until now,” said Wilkins.The pendant was found in a landscape that would have been boggy and wet during the bronze age. Curators think it would have been intentionally cast into the water as an offering, much as people today throw coins into fountains.It was found by a metal detectorist who wants to remain anonymous. All the correct procedures were adhered to in that it was reported to the local finds liaison officer who notified the coroner and brought it to the British Museum under the treasure process.A coroner found it to be treasure and the independent treasure valuation committee recommended to the culture secretary a valuation of £250,000.It will probably be known as the Shropshire sun pendant and will go on display from November at Shrewsbury museum and art gallery, near the find site. In 2021 it will come to the British Museum in London and will be displayed near other bronze age treasures such as the Mold gold cape.The pendant, 3.6cm by 4.7cm, is the second one ever found in Britain. The first was discovered during canal digging in Manchester in 1722 and was assumed by many experts to be Roman, because of its quality. It was last recorded in 1806 before disappearing from sight.Could it still be out there? “It is possible,” said Wilkin. “To find it would be astonishing but in some ways it wouldn’t surprise me. The weight of it means you wouldn’t necessarily think of melting it down for bullion. I do have a sneaking suspicion it is out there somewhere, just misunderstood or mislabelled.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3ef4a3ce6abc88f05a968b8cf50d67b0875a0b1/424_0_6288_3775/master/6288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16c92ac540bbbf996eb22162513c7957","title":"heads and councils press for extra 55bn for struggling schools","story":"Exclusive: group says provision for Send pupils in particular is ‘woefully underfunded’An alliance of headteachers, school governors, councils and unions are to lobby the chancellor for a further £5.5bn a year to help schools in England to avoid financial difficulties and cuts.The coalition, involving almost every significant organisation involved in state schools – including the National Governors Association and a bipartisan group representing both Conservative and Labour-led councils – is writing to Rishi Sunak before next week’s budget seeking additional funds, with a focus on “woefully underfunded” provision for pupils with special education needs and disabilities (Send).“Nurseries, schools and colleges are all struggling to meet growing costs and demands, with many having to reduce what they offer in order to meet their budgets,” the group says in a letter to Sunak and Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs parliament’s education select committee.A string of local authorities in England have been told by the government to drain their school budgets to help pay for their special needs obligations.Sabrina Hobbs, the principal of Severndale specialist academy in Shrewsbury, one of the largest special schools in England, with children aged from two to 19, said any further budget cuts could imperil staff and students.“The squeeze on special schools will soon begin to impact on the most vulnerable children within our communities as it will become impossible to accommodate their needs as resources and staffing are stripped right back,” Hobbs said.“Leadership has been cut, management has been cut and curriculum opportunities have been cut. There is nothing else without risking health and safety and quality of life.”Headteachers who back the lobbying say they are still being forced to reduce staff numbers and make cuts to essential provision, despite the government’s promises of an additional £7.1bn in school funding by 2022-23.“Much of that extra funding will be swallowed up on rising costs including increased and unfunded pay rises that have been introduced. This jeopardises the promised real-terms increased budgets for the schools and pupils themselves,” the letter says.The coalition says that once inflation and increases to teacher pay are taken into account, more than four out of five schools will be worse off this year than five years ago. Sixth forms and colleges will continue to be hardest hit.James McInnes, a Conservative councillor who heads the f40 group representing the local authorities with the lowest school funding in England, said: “Although we very much welcome the government’s investment, our analysis is that £12.6bn was needed across the country, so that falls short by £5.5bn.“So we need to work together as a coalition of unions, local authorities, teachers and parents, and say that while we welcome the extra funding, we also need to keep the pressure on central government so they understand that’s not the end of the story, that additional funding is still required.”McInnes, Devon county council’s cabinet member for children’s services and schools, said special needs funding requirements were causing budget deficits in councils around the country.“In Devon in the current financial year, we’re £21.5m overspent in the high needs block of the dedicated schools grant – that’s mainly special education needs and disabilities. Next year if there aren’t any changes, we’re projected to overspend about £45m.The Department for Education said: “This government wants to build an education system that boosts productivity, improves social mobility and equips children and adults with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the bright future that lies ahead.“That is why we are levelling up funding to ensure all schools have the right investment to deliver an outstanding education. On top of this, we are increasing high needs funding for local authorities by £780m next year, as well as £400m cash boost for 16-19 funding.”The letter to the chancellor will be backed by the main teaching and school leadership organisations including the National Association of Head Teachers, the Association of School and College Leaders and the National Education Union.The coalition includes Worth Less?, a group of headteachers who have been agitating for additional funding.Jules White, its founder and headteacher at Tanbridge House school in West Sussex, said: “At the moment our attention should rightly focus on events affecting the whole country. But even after the welcome government investment set for April 2020, cash-starved schools still require a major long-term funding plan to meet the needs of children and their families over the next 10 years.“The will from every school and every teacher to deliver a world-class system is there, but the resources are not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efc741f79d5fe978646914daec2690a202b175b2/0_127_3048_1829/master/3048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03916334293d39ae3db089084b55e86a","title":"glowing glowing gone plunge in glow worm numbers revealed","story":"Glow-worm numbers have plunged by three-quarters since 2001, research in England has revealed, with the climate crisis a clear factor.The larvae feed on damp-loving snails, and increasingly hot and dry summers mean fewer prey and a greater risk of glow-worms becoming desiccated.Some of the 19 sites studied across the Essex are on nature reserves. The data there showed that clearing scrub and coppicing woods to open up ground helped offset glow-worm losses, indicating that conservation action is possible.Glow-worms are small beetles and they exist in small patches across the UK. The females glow green to attract mates. They are wingless, making it hard for them to rebuild lost populations.“Glow-worms were thought to be declining, and probably for several decades now, but there was no hard evidence,” said Tim Gardiner, of the Environment Agency, who led the research. “We have shown a big decline, and at many different sites around Essex. The changing climate has undoubtedly played a role.”Scientists warned in February that “fates of humans and insects are intertwined”, with the huge declines reported in some places only the “tip of the iceberg”. They acknowledge that little is known about most of the estimated 5.5 million insect species but said enough was understood to warrant immediate action.Widespread insect declines threaten a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”, with dire consequences for humanity, some scientists have said.Gardiner emphasised the intrinsic wonder of glow-worms. “I still remember when I saw my first one. It was just magical, and every summer I still get a pang of excitement on seeing the first one. Wouldn’t it be sad if there weren’t these things any more?”The glow-worm research was one of a dozen studies published in a special issue of Insect Conservation and Diversity. Many report declines in some – but not all – insects.In the US, scientists compiled sightings of the endangered Poweshiek skipperling butterfly from 1872 to now, showing that its geographic range has shrunk dramatically over time. Evidence from 217 sites shows the butterfly was historically common across the prairies of the upper mid-western US. But populations declined rapidly in the past 20 years as habitat was destroyed, and the butterfly is now extinct at all but five locations.Prof Raphael Didham, of the University of Western Australia, who edited the special issue of the journal, said: “The problem is clearly global in extent, but the solutions needed are going to be many-fold and range from local inidual choices to regional policies that reduce the intensity of human impacts on the environment, and global commitments to maintaining insect bioersity.”But he said the available data did not in itself constitute evidence for a sudden and catastrophic collapse of all insect populations. “In fact, we need to be equally worried about some examples of insect population increases as well, such as new incursions of invasive species, or cyclical pest outbreaks, and geographic range expansions due to climate change that could disrupt sensitive natural ecosystems,” Didham said.On the plight of glow-worms in England, Gardiner said: “People should visit their local sites and become a champion for glow-worms. They’re not legally protected and by the time they become legally protected, it may be too late.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1af22196b44c7e5e3ec6dd5cc42ead700115fe17/0_0_4124_2400/master/4124.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a1f77ab01108333c55f759209393c5ba 1440w","title":"no sweat 12 of the best jumpers for men in pictures","story":"From argyle to silk, get cosy in our top pick of this season’s knitwear"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0808fd8f0c72796d16750c78dca44da87b460167/0_74_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2298732d9c05477c08bc5a8b0e5c46fe","title":"vitalina varela review secrets lies and a search for the past amid the ruins","story":"Varela stars as herself in Pedro Costa’s bleak but beautiful film about a woman discovering the hidden life of her late husbandIf there is a cinema of the dispossessed, then its hero has to be the Portuguese film-maker Pedro Costa. His static, austere and often dreamlike movies – unfolding in a mysterious, forbidding semi-darkness – are about marginalised souls, often those in the impoverished (and now demolished) Fontaínhas shantytown in Lisbon. His new film once again reminded me of the pure Beckettian bleakness and starkness in his work: its characters are lonely unsmiling people living below the poverty line who have endured much. Their material wretchedness is not endowed with a condescending nobility but with a serenely laconic self-reliance. Costa and cinematographer Leonardo Simões have composed strangely compelling images of crumbling walls and shadowy, tatty interiors, picked out with fierce key lights to give them an almost modernist look, as if they were studio sets. Almost all of the film takes place at night, except the very end, when there is daylight and even sunlight. The result is weirdly moving.Once again, Costa is using a nonprofessional actor and telling her real story. Vitalina Varela is from the island of Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony, who appeared briefly in Costa’s 2014 film Horse Money and now takes centre stage. She has a massively imperturbable dignity and limpid gaze. In the mid-1980s, Varela was married to a man with whom she was building a family home, brick by brick. (There are some quietly amazing reverie-like flashbacks to their lives together on the island.) But Vitalina’s husband ran out on her and went to Lisbon, having promised her that he would send money, or at any rate bring her over to join him.But he never did. Now, after 40 years, Vitalina has finally come to Lisbon to confront him. (There is an extraordinarily surreal, if atypically showy, scene in which the plane is on the tarmac – at night, of course – and Vitalina’s silhouette is dramatically revealed in the open door as she waits for the steps to be brought over.) She discovers, though, that her husband died just a week before. There is nothing left for Vitalina to do but visit the ghetto flat where he lived. She now haunts it like a ghost, brooding over photos of his other woman and occasionally exchanging sparse words with his neighbours.Then Vitalina recognises someone from home. The priest who conducted her late husband’s funeral ceremony (the one she just missed) is a man she knows was once driven half out of his mind by shame and grief: back in Cape Verde, he refused to baptise a coach-party of people who had arrived without having completed the proper paperwork. He sent them away, and their coach crashed horribly, condemning them to agonising deaths – and the priest to an irrational sense that he or God had done something unforgivable. Now he, too, is a refugee in the uncaring imperial mother country of Portugal: ageing, ill, with a tremor in his right hand. He is played by Costa’s veteran repertory actor Ventura.Vitalina and the priest should have much in common, but she is exasperated by his assumption that her husband was a victim to be respected and pitied, a poor man who died a lonely death. “Men favour men!” snaps Vitalina. “When you see a woman’s face in the coffin, you can’t imagine her suffering.” And for two hours, we have the challenge of imagining Vitalina’s own suffering, her need to surmount that suffering, her implacable will to survive and her silent, defiant resilience after being cheated of a confrontational moment that would have brought closure. The fact that we know all this actually happened to the woman on screen is both a revelation and a concealment. Like many nonprofessional actors in movies, Vitalina is directed so as to present a calm, unexpressive face to the camera. Perhaps that style is withholding what she feels, and creating a fictional persona of opaque grief.This film demands a great deal of attention, but to me it works better than Costa’s widely admired Horse Money. There is an immersive deep-seriousness in Costa’s otherworldly artistry – and moments of pathos, such as when poor Vitalina starts reading aloud from a scrappy newspaper clipping about, of all things, Princess Elizabeth’s first meeting with Prince Philip in 1939. Does Vitalina wonder about the destiny of her own life, betrayed by a man who eluded her, even to the last? She is like a monument to her own stoicism, and her transcendent indifference to our pity radiates from the screen.• Vitalina Varela is released in the UK on 6 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3058cb7960c9407e9affe2258e54d2e0b7b1d53/837_1114_6087_3652/master/6087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3815d89ac9712055244ee3331f9496a0","title":"how to cook the perfect rum babas recipe","story":"The definitive method of making these boozy little classicsThese innocuous-looking, yet intoxicating little cakes have fallen as far out of favour in the UK as their fellow stalwart of the 70s sweet trolley, the black forest gateau, though happily they’re still easy to find in their native France, where they often come with a bonus shot of rum on the side.Once soaked in rum syrup, all are, of course, delicious, but the looser the structure, the more of this is able to be absorbed, and the lighter the overall result. For that reason. I’m going to err on the plainer side of things, and, like Larousse, go for strong bread flour, rather than ordinary, or Koffmann’s soft cake flour, to help on the open crumb front (Koffmann specifies French T45 , but that proves thin on the ground amidst the jumble of spelt and brown rice varieties in my local supermarket).Pic and Leiths use milk rather than water in their doughs, but I don’t think it makes much difference to flavour or texture the principal taste, before soaking, ought be that of butter and just a hint of salt, which stops the end product from being overwhelmingly sweet.As a descendant of the kugelhof, it makes sense that babas would originally have been much larger than the inidual portions common today. Many of the recipes suggest they can also be made in a bigger mould, and I take Leiths up on this by baking its version in a decorative bundt tin. Though it looks impressive, I would caution against doing the same, for the simple reason that it’s much harder to immerse such a thing fully in syrup, so it runs the risk of being rather dry.You can flavour the cakes with citrus zest, as Leiths does, but more common, if controversial, is the addition of dried fruit, usually soaked in rum – Willan chooses currants, Larousse raisins. Such things, as any ice-cream aficionado can attest, pair extremely well with rum, but to my mind, they add too much to the overall sweetness of this dish if I were going to gild this particular lily with anything, it would involve a contrasting flavour, such as sour cherries or bitter candied peel ... but I’m not, because I like the simplicity of the dish without them. If you have a particular yearning for fruit, I’d recommend serving it alongside in the form of fresh berries, or indeed the candied pineapple Koffmann favours.This need be no more than sugar and water, but I think it’s sensible to make it quite strong, because reducing it risks the mixture becoming too thick for the babas to absorb. Though none of the recipes I try suggests it, I’m going to make mine with brown, rather than white sugar, because I think the flavour works well with the rum.Strangely, most are also silent on the specifics of the booze – surely the defining characteristic of this dessert – with only a couple calling for dark rum. I do try it with golden rum, too (the blander white stuff seems a waste of time if that’s all you have, be generous with it), but if you’re buying a bottle especially, the strong molasses note of the dark kind makes it our preference.For a really punchy finish, instead of adding the rum to the syrup, sprinkle it over the finished cakes, as both Larousse and Leiths recommend just don’t let anyone drive afterwards.Pic infuses her syrup with vanilla, Koffmann adds orange and lemon peel, too, while Willan rather intriguingly goes for coriander seeds, which ide the crowd. A mixture of orange and vanilla proves more popular, but you could use cinnamon, star anise, cardamom or just about any spice that takes your fancy.The recipes employ a variety of techniques to get this syrup into the babas, from painting it on to the cake straight from the oven (Leiths) to adding the babas to a boiling pan (Larousse). But the most successful is Pic’s: she immerses them in cold syrup and leaves them to soak, which cuts out the slightly faffy step of tenderly turning them over and over until you judge they’ve absorbed the maximum amount of liquid.Koffmann observes that “Babas need to be very moist … and the best way to guarantee this is to bake the cakes several days in advance and leave them to harden and go slightly stale. Like stale bread, you’ll find that they’ll be desperate to soak up the liquid.” It’s true – if you have the time, make them up to a week ahead.Serving suggestions in the recipes I try include Pic’s chestnut sauce and vanilla cream, and Koffmann’s chantilly, but I’m not sure you need more than simple whipped cream, a shot of rum – and some fresh fruit, if you must.It is best to make these in medium savarin or ring moulds, though you can get by with small dariole basins or even fairy cake tins.Prep 20 min plus proving and soaking Cook 20 minServes 44g dried yeast3 tsp demerara sugar75g butter, plus extra to grease 200g strong bread flour1 tsp fine salt2 eggs, beatenFor the syrup400g demerara sugar 1 vanilla pod, split 200ml dark rumPut the yeast in a bowl with 75ml warm water and a pinch of the sugar, stir to combine. then leave until bubbly on top. Meanwhile, melt the butter and set aside, then whisk the flour, salt and remaining sugar in a large bowl or food mixer.Mix in the yeast and half the egg, followed by the rest of the egg. Once throughly combined, gradually beat in the butter until you have a smooth batter.Grease the moulds thoroughly with butter, and ide the batter between them, filling each hole no more than half full. Leave in a non-draughty place until the batter rises nearly to fill the moulds.While the babas are proving, and if you’re planning to serve them imminently, make the syrup. Heat the sugar in 500ml water, then addthe vanilla pod and its seeds. Stir to dissolve the sugar, then, once it comes to a simmer, take it off the heat and set aside to cool. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4. When the syrup is cool, add the rum. Bake the babas for 20-25 minutes, until golden, then leave to cool on a wire rack. Leave for several days, if possible, then immerse in the syrup and leave for two hours, turning occasionally. Drain and serve with the extra syrup in a jug on the side.• Rum babas: deserving of revival, or a dessert best left in the past?

But the night is likely to be remembered for Eric Dier making his way into the stand to confront a supporter.After Jan Vertonghen’s early goal was cancelled out by a goalkeeping error from Michel Vorm that elicited an equaliser from Josip Drmic, Spurs fell apart in the shootout as Tim Krul saved two penalties. Erik Lamela, Troy Parrott and Gedson Fernandes all failed to score from the spot.Despite another bitter defeat, Mourinho said he was ecstatic with his team’s performance: “I think the game was so fantastic and a real representation of what the FA Cup is and the FA Cup has to be.”Tottenham arrived in the fifth round with their form crumbling before their eyes. Mourinho has spent much of his time attempting to manage expectations and ert attention from his own decisions by reminding the world at every opportunity of the crippling injuries surrounding his team.But even if the absences of key players like Harry Kane and Son Heung-min would be a nightmare for most teams, they had not explained his indecision as he flitted through four different formations in the last four games. Here he altered the chemistry again, abandoning the back three employed in the 3-2 defeat to Wolves in favour of a return to 4-2-3-1, with Vorm appearing for his first game since October 2018, while youngster Oliver Skipp was drafted into midfield.It seemed to be a mild success earlier on as it was one of his changes, Vertonghen, who put Tottenham into the lead. A month ago, Vertonghen sat inconsolable on the Spurs bench, fighting tears after being substituted in the 54th minute of Spurs’ 3-2 win over Southampton. Thirteen minutes into the tie he seemed achieve some redemption by firing a header into the net from a Giovani Lo Celso free-kickAs the match wore on, Tottenham’s early waves of counterattacks petered out as Norwich began to show why they have generated so much goodwill despite sitting rock bottom of the league.As usual, they built nicely from the back with silkily combined rapid, pretty combinations. In the thick of everything good was Todd Cantwell, hair flowing and feet twirling as he made his mark. Norwich’s sustained pressure finally led to an equaliser and it took a disastrous piece of goalkeeping from Vorm as he dropped a routine save straight into the path of Drmic, who scored easily.As the away side flowed, Tottenham struggled and in their most advanced role, Dele Alli looked a shadow of himself as he continually lost the ball and halted attacks.As the game flitted to its conclusion, Tottenham responded immediately and moved on to the front foot, but neither in the dying moments of regular time when Serge Aurier forced Ben Godfrey to save heroically his shot off the line, nor in a sterile extra time more memorable for tired legs than the few paltry chances created by either team.“After the equaliser, the team was the only team, with all the respect for Norwich, but we were the team that was close to winning in 90 minutes,” Mourinho said.“And then in extra time, we were the team that tried.The boys did everything they could. I think they deserve to win the game on 90 minutes, on extra time. Penalties is penalties, credit for them.”Krul had Tottenham’s penalty takers and their preferred directions listed on his water bottle as he stepped out to the goal and he showed that preparation is always key by saving Fernandes’ final penalty to send his team through.As the fans booed and the Totttenham players departed from the pitch, Eric Dier became caught up in an incident with a fan in the crowd. The defender marched into the crowd and began climbing rows in pursuit of a fleeing fan.Footage from other fans captured an angry Dier shouting “he’s my brother” as stewards eventually dragged him away from the fans.Mourinho later defended his player, stating that Dier had reacted to heckling by a fan as his younger brother stood nearby.In the end, the story quickly became about a dramatic altercation in the crowd rather than another bad defeat for Tottenham. Even when Mourinho loses, he wins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20063fa8c385e07b99aae33968456bdf59e76325/114_0_1791_1075/master/1791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6002039919f8c4863f5f51ecd136b5f","title":"lair of the clockwork god review size five games","story":"PC, Size Five GamesSize Five delivers both classic platforming and point-and-click adventuring in this self-aware and deeply anglocentric caperIn a bygone era, when our attention s could outlast a TikTok video, point-and-click adventure games from developers such as Sierra Online and LucasArts brought intrigue, excitement and daft jokes to our new beige personal computers. These were mentally taxing, longform experiences that often provided the sharpest wit, the most endearing characters, and tales that endured endured long after the credits scrolled.Lair of the Clockwork God was always going to need to find a new take on an old and marginalised genre. But it succeeds in doing so, by cross-pollinating with platforming – and a particularly demanding type of platforming at that.If that sounds like a recipe for seething at your screen through a clenched jaw, it’s testament to writer-designers Dan Marshall and Ben Ward that far more often it’s a vessel for inventive puzzles and a distinctive brand of wry observational humour about game design.Our dual protagonists Dan and Ben are a pair of bewildered everymen facing not one but several apocalypses, and they embody opposing schools of thought. Ben, studious and resistant to modern terminology such as “crafting”, is the point-and-click component. Controlling him is a matter of leisurely ambling between objects of interest and interacting with them via a classic adventure game interface: look at, push, talk to, use inventory, combine items in inventory until hitting on the right pairing. “You can press the spacebar all you like,” he tells you, but as a staunch adventure-game protagonist he’s not going to jump.That’s solely the preserve of Ben. Switching control to him feels like dropping into a different game. He runs everywhere at a full sprint, leaps over obstacles and through gravity tears that send him falling upwards. He constantly berates Dan for his stubbornly adventure-gamey way of tackling obstacles.This interplay between the two is Lair of the Clockwork Gods’ strongest asset. It provides the foundation of its puzzles, and of the likable absurdity within them. Presented with a shin-high ridge in the ground, Dan declares it impassable and must call upon his more mobile accomplice to provide passage. Naturally that involves huffing helium from the balloon of a disembowelled clown, emptying his bladder in a Portaloo via physics-defying manoeuvres and ultimately being piggybacked over the minuscule bump. This is a game well-versed in the convoluted nature of adventure-game puzzles and leans into it with a wink.It doesn’t always work. While the writing usually comes across as authentic repartee, every now and then it tips over into tryhard territory. At times the duo are a touch too ready to point out that this is a game you’re playing, and aren’t games silly?It works when they’re explaining away the deus ex machinas and keeping things rolling along – the repeated and increasingly preposterous uses for a leaky battery become funnier each time – but less so when Ben and Dan simply spout seen-it-all observations. The last thing you want on your 14th attempt at a gruelling jumping sequence is a withering take on modern life.Getting stuck comes with the territory. It’s a rite of passage in any adventure game, let alone one with a constantly escalating platformer component: here’s a double-jump! Now here’s a sprint! And you might as well take this gun, too. Use them all in a demanding platform sequence, why don’t you?But if you’re going to get stuck, it might as well be at the hands of a mind-bending sequence of jumps and gravity shifts instead of – as in the olden days – Byzantine puzzling. Lair of the Clockwork God strikes an impressive balance between its two mashup genres, mechanically and tonally. It’s a post-ironic take on point-and-clicks rather than a dewy-eyed nostalgia trip, and better for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b9e35693626e8a7964b7ebcdf3d10e4714d57ce/0_73_3088_1854/master/3088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4544acba269708633e952f0989ca9b71","title":"nine out of 10 people found to be biased against women","story":"Analysis of 75 countries reveals ‘shocking’ scale of global women’s rights backlashThe UN Development Programme (UNDP), which published its findings on Thursday, is calling on governments to introduce legislation and policies that address engrained prejudice.“We all know we live in a male-dominated world, but with this report we are able to put some numbers behind these biases,” said Pedro Conceição, director of the UNDP’s human development report office. “And the numbers, I consider them shocking.“What our report shows is a pattern that repeats itself again and again. Big progress in more basic areas of participation and empowerment. But when we get to more empowering areas, we seem to be hitting a wall.”Conceição said the data show that perceptions and expectations in society about the role of women are prejudiced against them.“While in many countries these biases are shrinking, in many others the biases are actually sliding back. If you take the overall average of the information we have, we show that on average we are sliding back – that biases, instead of shrinking, are growing back.”The figures are based on two sets of data collected from almost 100 countries through the World Values Survey, which examines changing attitudes in almost 100 countries and how they impact on social and political life. The figures cover periods from 2005-09 and 2010-2014, the latest year for which there is data.Sweden, for example, was one of several countries – including South Africa, India, Rwanda and Brazil – in which the percentage of people who held at least one bias increased over the nine years the data covered. More than half of people in the UK and the US held at least one bias.Lagunas said it was difficult to predict whether attitudes have changed more recently, but suggested the report’s findings “may make the road ahead more difficult”.The report comes as rights campaigners call on world leaders to accelerate action to meet global targets on gender equality.“As representatives of leading organisations championing gender equality, we’re raising the alarm about the pace of progress. There is no time left for business as usual: gender equality can be achieved for billions of girls and women by 2030, but it requires everyone to move faster,” read an open letter, signed by nine presidents and CEOs of organisations including Plan International, Women Deliver, the One Campaign and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.“We’ve found that, if the current pace continues, 67 countries – home to 2.1 billion girls and women – will not achieve any of the key gender equality targets we studied by 2030.”These countries are not just the poorest. If trends over the past two decades continue, the US will be among them.In June, a gender index published by the Equal Measures 2030 partnership found that no country was on track to achieve gender equality by 2030, the deadline to achieve the UN sustainable development goals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/655039ae3e1f2502ddc3d6c66c57a4934349ff3c/103_110_1966_1179/master/1966.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ae7711d535f104d5e97d62eeb329274","title":"australian newspaper prints extra pages to help out in toilet paper shortage","story":"NT News, known for its humorous front pages, produces a special edition amid panic over loo roll shortageIt’s the panic that keeps on giving.#ToiletPaperEmergency or the great #ToiletPaperApocalypse, as it has been dubbed on Twitter, has already rolled out hundreds of memes, witty asides as well as documented the madness of people stockpiling the toilet essential.In the real world it has led to Australian toilet paper manufacturers ramping up production to keep up with demand from people fearful of coronavirus.One newspaper has gone one step further by printing extra pages in its editions to help out those who have been … caught short.On Thursday the NT News, the Darwin-based newspaper with a national reputation for its headlines and antics, printed a special eight-page insert that can be cut into toilet paper.Its editor, Matt Williams, told  Australia the paper was selling well and was “certainly not a crappy edition”.“We are a newspaper known around the world who understands the needs of our readers,” he said. “Territorians … are in great need of toilet paper right now so we had to deliver what they needed.”The stunt comes after supermarkets including Coles and Woolworths have been besieged by shoppers clearing their shelves of loo paper and hand sanitiser.Even at Millicent in South Australia, the town that mills most of Australia’s toilet paper supplies, local shops have had to order in extra stock, the ABC has reported.The Kimberley-Clark mill has increased its production to 24 hours a day in response to supermarket shortages, in an attempt to get supply back on to shelves.The ethical subscription toilet paper service Who Gives a Crap said it had sold out of all products.And he managing director of Australian Bidet, Randall Cadby, said the business had been inundated with calls, emails and website traffic.Attempts to stockpile toilet paper began this week amid panic buying of long-life food other staples. It remains unclear why people have begun hoarding vast quantities of the product, given that there has been no indication stocks might run low and there is not likely to be increased an need for toilet paper in the event the coronavirus spreads to a significant extent.The Twitter hashtag #ToiletPaperEmergency – featuring images of people attempting to stockpile massive quantities of paper, empty supermarket shelves and those trying to profit from reselling rolls – has become the top trend in Australia.On Thursday Australia’s largest supermarket announced it would implement a four-pack limit for customers.On Thursday morning a truck carrying supplies of toilet paper caught fire on the Gateway Bridge, near Brisbane. About half the rolls were saved.“This is not overly common, particularly around the city areas, but the main thing is no one got hurt tonight and we’ve been able to save quite a lot of toilet paper,” a fire officer, Justin Francis, told the ABC.“There was quite an interesting fuel load on this particular vehicle as we believe toilet paper is quite precious at the moment, so we’ve been able to save half the load on this particular truck,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de73a78294eb3da92a6931c2aea32787400e66e5/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a57ef7dc331d0faae31f2b292e0c842","title":"tell us are money struggles making you lonely","story":"We want to find out how people are feeling isolated by their financial woesWe may be bad at talking about money but we are arguably even worse at talking about our difficulties managing it.Research by the Money Advice Service found that half of people in debt did not want to talk to friends and family about it because they didn’t want to worry them.Money struggles can lead to people feeling cut off from others for a range of reasons, but withdrawing into financial loneliness can make it even harder to solve your problems.We want to understand more about how people feel isolated as a result of their financial woes.How has your employment status affected your income?

Her long-time confidante Sarah Townsend made the arrangements.On 22 August 2019, six days before the day Bell was scheduled to die, a freelance photojournalist and an interviewer met Bell at Townsend’s home. Bell sat in an armchair in the living room, wearing scarlet lipstick and freshly styled hair for the camera, and, looking straight ahead, described her plight.She wanted to live longer, she could live longer, but she had to die now. Otherwise, she risked losing her chance to die with dignity. In order to meet the Canadian regulations for medical assistance in dying, known as Maid, Bell had to die before she became any sicker.This, she believed, was wrong, as she explained on camera. “This is my last activist ...” she said into the camera and paused, searching for the perfect word.

During those visits, Bell told herself that she did not want her family and friends to endure the stress of caring for her if she ever developed Alzheimer’s.“I remember how awful it was to see the deterioration of this woman who lost everything, every part of her ultimately except her shell,” she said.Bell first noticed something amiss when she was 82 years old. She’d lose her line of thought while reading, “and reading was one of my, since childhood, my favourite things to do”, she said. She was taking university courses in writing and philosophy at the time, and dropped them because she couldn’t concentrate.She saw a doctor who gave her the diagnosis: Alzheimer’s disease, early stage.Bell, who lived alone, saw herself changing in the months after her diagnosis. She got physically lost going shopping and mentally lost during conversations. She grew frustrated when she could not find the perfect word or figure out her way through a problem.Solving problems was her job: she’d been a lifelong activist who had advocated for breaking down barriers to women in the workplace since the 1970s. “I never marched or burned my bra,” she said, but “my concern about the status of women in society was a very key one. I tried everything I could to have an impact on that.” She marched in gay pride parades long before most politicians dared to, dyeing her hair purple in support of the LGBTQ+ community.A single mother of three, Bell put herself through university at night while working full-time. She went to become a high-ranking civil servant, overseeing more than 700 employees in the province’s health commission. After retiring, she was wooed back to work for a year, a job she did partly pro bono, to help a not-for-profit organization that supports women and at-risk pregnant teens.Other people might be more easygoing about fumbling for the right word but Bell was not, she said. She was becoming uncharacteristically emotional and found herself weeping in public. “This is thwarting me … one loss piles on top of another loss, and until it gets to the point where, being a human being of my nature and type, there’s scarcely anything left in it,” she said. “I don’t know how best to explain that.”She recognized that her disease was worsening and, in May 2019, she made the choice to apply for an assisted death before she lost her independence.The problem, as she saw it, is that Canada’s Maid law currently only covers people who have the capacity to give informed consent on the day of their death, so a person with advanced Alzheimer’s is unlikely to qualify. What’s more, it is impossible with a disease like Alzheimer’s to predict when a person will lose their capacity to consent. The rate of change can be unpredictable – often, an event like a fall or an infection can suddenly speed up decline.She weighed the decision privately before she set a date. She feared making the wrong choice – of waiting too long and missing out on the chance to have medical help in dying, or dying too early and missing out on time with those she loved, including her grandchildren and great-granddaughter.In the video, Bell is razor-sharp, logical and unemotional. She speaks in sentences of complex structure – contrary to the commonly held stereotype of a person with Alzheimer’s. When she laughs, she throws her head back with delight. But for most of the two hours, she delivers her message with sobriety, arguing that the more than 500,000 Canadians with Alzheimer’s and other dementias should be able to make advanced requests for medical assistance in dying.“If I had been able to do an advanced request, I would not have had to decide to make that decision to die now,” said Bell. “I have been forced to decide now because I fear that at some future time, I will not be able to request it due to the compromise in my brain being much more severe.”You can hear her explain how sure she was:In 2016, the Canadian government passed a law allowing medical assistance in dying. Nurse practitioners or physicians can assess a person’s eligibility for Maid and carry out the procedure, and it is covered by the country’s publicly funded health system.But there are restrictions. To be eligible, a person must meet certain criteria: they must be candidates for health services funded by a government within Canada they must be at least 18 years old and capable of making decisions about their health. They must have a “grievous and irremediable medical condition”. The request must be voluntary, and the person requesting it must be informed of all the means available to relieve their suffering, including palliative care.And, finally, they must give informed consent at least twice: first, on the day they are assessed for eligibility and again, after a minimum 10-day waiting period, on the day they receive Maid. To give informed consent, a person must have “capacity” – a medical concept demonstrated by skills involving memory, judgment and decision-making.Many supporters of Maid in Canada feel the law is too restrictive. They want to see an end to the requirement for informed consent on the day of death. They want the law changed so a person could make an advanced request for Maid – a modification called Audrey’s Amendment, named for Audrey Parker, a Halifax woman who opted to die earlier than she planned because she worried her cognition was beginning to falter, as a result of her incurable cancer.“In cases like Leila’s and Audrey’s, and a number of other cases across the country that we know about, people are fearful that they will lose capacity and therefore they get medical assistance in dying early,” said Jim Cowan, a retired Canadian senator and board member for Dying With Dignity Canada.Since Canada’s Maid law came into effect in June 2016, more than 13,000 Canadians have chosen to die peacefully with the help of a physician or nurse practitioner. It is unknown how many more people were assessed and approved but lost capacity before the procedure was performed, said Cowan. “They continue to suffer intolerably, which is bizarre.”Last month, the Trudeau government introduced a bill to make amendments to the legislation, following a public consultation in which more than 300,000 Canadians participated. If passed, the bill would allow advanced waivers for people who are nearing the end of their lives – meaning, under certain conditions, they would not need to give final and informed consent for an assisted death on the day they died. This would achieve Audrey Parker’s dream.But the amendments would not achieve Bell’s wishes. She hoped that people with dementias would be able to write advanced directives setting out the conditions that would trigger their medically assisted death.Bell wanted to wait until she met the criteria for mid-stage Alzheimer’s.“Leila wanted to be able to set out a condition in advance, not a date,” said Townsend.A parliamentary review of Maid is scheduled to begin by June and will consider further amendments to assisted dying in Canada, including eligibility for people with conditions like dementias that could affect their decision-making capacity at some point in the future.Dr Jennifer Gibson, director of the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics, called for more discussion about advanced requests in the context of dementia, but she was happy with the direction Canada was moving.“We’re going to need the runway of some time to think about ... how we might be responsive to the interests of persons with dementia who want, like the rest of us without dementia, to be the author of the ends of their own lives,” she said.Informed consent can be difficult for someone struggling with a terminal illness. Cancers tend to follow a general trajectory – the body declines but the mind remains sharp until closer to the end. A person with cancer is an alert witness to their changing body, able to track their own degeneration and make informed decisions about their medical care until closer to the end.Their capacity can deteriorate, and quickly. A combination of disease and medication can wreak havoc with their thought patterns. This is not uncommon in the advanced stages of cancer: patients become drowsy and confused. They forget where they are and what is happening. Even if they have already been approved for Maid, they may be unable to engage with a physician on the day of their planned death to affirm, with certainty, that they understand the stakes, to say this is how and when they choose to end their life.It is different for a person with any type of dementia, including Alzheimer’s. Someone with Alzheimer’s loses their cognitive function progressively, often over years. Their ability to give informed consent can disappear long before their body nears its natural death.It’s that long period of uncertainty, of living without capacity, that Leila Bell feared.For 40 years, Bell supported the right to die with dignity. She longed for assisted dying in Canada before it was legal, as she watched some of the people closest to her die. In 1991, her second husband, Clare, to whom she’d been married for nearly 20 years, died from complications following a heart attack. Leila fell into deep depression and moved in with her best friend, who later died from diabetes. In 2002, Bell’s 49-year-old daughter, Anne, developed an unusual gastrointestinal condition and died, after being cared for by her mother.“I always felt people should have the choice of an assisted death,” Bell said. “We have our own lives to live and we have a right to live those lives in the way we want to as long as we’re not hurting anybody else.”When it was time, Bell sought out Dr Ellen Wiebe, a well-known supporter and practitioner of Maid in Vancouver. Wiebe was the first physician in Canada to perform Maid outside of Quebec. After several appointments, Wiebe told Bell that she was eligible for an assisted death but she’d have to die earlier than she would naturally. Wiebe could see Bell’s capacity deteriorating. “She was at risk within a relatively short time of losing capacity,” said Wiebe.Bell chose a date in late August. She wanted to squeeze in as much time with her family as she could before she died. In June, she flew her two grandchildren to Vancouver. She sat them down and handed them a letter she’d written, explaining her diagnosis and her decision. She wrote that she did not want them to remember her like she remembered her mother in the last stages of Alzheimer’s. They pushed back they said they didn’t see any change in her. They held her letter up as an example of her high level of functioning.Her granddaughter Erin Spence, who has one daughter and is now pregnant with a second child, told her grandmother that she wanted her children to know their great grandmother. She and her brother were not opposed to assisted dying but they could not wrap their minds around the immediacy of her decision.“We just felt like, ‘Why do you do have this now?’” said Spence. “I didn’t notice any difference in her, to be perfectly honest. I really didn’t.”But eventually, Spence and her brother “understood that she had no other choice”.Bell explains how those conversations were difficult for both parties:Bell said she never wavered after her decision, but came up with the idea of recording a video to lobby for change. She paid for the recording of the video and bequeathed it to Dying With Dignity Canada via Townsend.“Leila was extraordinary: independent, stubborn, persistent, an activist,” said Townsend. “But a good death should be available to each ordinary one of us. One shouldn’t have to be extraordinary or lucky to have a good death.”Bell organized a party with her friends four days before she died and a quiet family dinner the night before. She died on 28 August 2019, surrounded by her daughter and her daughter’s partner, Townsend and her partner, and her grandchildren and their spouses.Before she died, Bell thanked everyone in the room for surrounding her with love, “like a warm blanket”.Then, she smiled and winked, and died a few minutes later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b430520d647eb4a447c149f75b51cd55b17998a/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e299491881a596a46815da3af0f3339","title":"one in five europeans exposed to harmful noise pollution study","story":"Estimated 113 million people across continent affected by road noise at unhealthy levelsOne in five Europeans is exposed to harmful levels of noise pollution, and this number is set to rise in the next decade, with road traffic the biggest culprit, a new study has shown.Excessive noise can cause physical and mental illness, and is associated with higher levels of heart disease, stress and sleeplessness. About 12,000 premature deaths are caused by noise in Europe each year, according to the European Environment Agency (EEA), while noise contributes to about 48,000 cases of ischaemic heart disease.Wildlife is also affected: a study last year showed noise hampers birds’ ability to communicate, and can stop them from mating.The EEA, Europe’s environmental watchdog, warned in a report on Thursday that more people were likely to be affected by harmful noise levels in future, as the result of increasing urbanisation and mobility.Across Europe, an estimated 113 million people are affected by road traffic noise levels above 55 decibels, the threshold at which noise becomes harmful to human health by the World Health Organization’s definition.In addition, 22 million people are exposed to high levels of railway noise and 4 million people to high levels of aircraft noise. At least 12,500 European schoolchildren are estimated to suffer learning impairment because of aircraft noise. Other noisy industries affect about a million people across the continent.There are many ways to reduce noise. Electric vehicles are quieter than diesel and petrol-driven cars.Like electric vehicles, walking and cycling reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the same time as lowering the decibels. Roads can be resurfaced with smoother asphalt, traffic management can also help, and reducing speed limits works in urban areas.Town planners can also ensure there are quiet areas, such as parks or other green spaces.The EEA said it was hampered in its research by EU member states failing to supply the data required by the EU noise directive, even though the deadline was 2017. Nearly a third of the data required was not available. The EEA said this showed that countries were not taking the steps needed to address the noise problem.A spokesperson for the UK government said: “We are committed to ensuring that noise pollution is managed effectively in order to promote good health and quality of life. We have strong protections in place to avoid significant noise impacts in our planning system, environmental permitting systems, in vehicle and product standards and noise abatement legislation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b0e2207115b93676aa4130c83673157f843391c/0_257_3153_1892/master/3153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=949b3ed8e2903df25db8973be94c3f9a","title":"cas criticises sun yang for lack of remorse during swimming doping case","story":"The Court of Arbitration for Sport criticised Chinese swimmer Sun Yang for showing “no regret” for his actions during an aborted drugs test that resulted in an eight-year ban for the Olympic champion.The Switzerland-based Cas on Friday accepted an appeal from the World Anti-Doping Agency against a decision by swimming body Fina to clear Sun of wrongdoing for his conduct during a 2018 test.Sun argued during the hearing that testers failed to prove their identity and behaved in an unprofessional manner, prompting him to have members of his entourage destroy vials containing his blood samples.In the full decision posted on CAS’s website and made public on Wednesday, Cas said the swimmer had sought to shift blame to testers and his entourage and taken no responsibility for his actions.“It was striking that, in the course of his testimony, at no point did the athlete express any regret as to his actions, or indicate that, with the benefit of hindsight, it might have been preferable for him to have acted differently,” the decision said.“Rather, as the proceedings unfolded, he dug his heels in and, eventually, sought to blame others for the manifest failings that occurred. At no point ... did he confront the possibility that he might have overreacted in his actions.“The panel said it had rejected Sun’s testimony that the testers had recommended that he take possession of the samples due to his concerns about the testing process. The testers, conversely, said they had repeatedly warned Sun about the consequences of interfering in the testing process.“In this regard, the panel notes that the athlete appears to have a forceful personality, and seems to have an expectation that his views should be allowed to prevail,” the decision said. “This was apparent during the hearing.”Sun, who was given a three-month ban for doping in 2014, has maintained his innocence and said in a statement on Friday that he had retained a lawyer to appeal to the Swiss federal court.The 28-year-old is the reigning world and Olympic champion in 200 metres freestyle and won two gold medals at the 2012 London Games and another at Rio de Janeiro in 2016.Cas’s full decision also noted that Wada had sought to have all of Sun’s results dating back to the 2018 test cancelled, which would mean stripping him of his 200m and 400m freestyle gold medals at last year’s world championships.Fina has not ruled on Sun’s results but one of its vice presidents told Australian media this week that the governing body would be “open” to cancelling them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51be8b288e4d5a8c89d348de3856ee9759c214b9/0_179_3280_1968/master/3280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a7ae82587a1921deb55e553d7c766d3","title":"south africa v australia womens twenty20 world cup semi final live","story":"A 13-over chase for South Africa! They require 98 to win. We are yet to get a formal message about overstarget. But the key information is this: they are going to get on before the 9:49pm cut off. Talk about leaving this to the very last minute for Australia! If they get up here, it’ll be quite the story. Just when we thought this was trending towards a washout, reports from the ground are that the rain has stopped and the cover are off. Blimey! I’m with Izzy. 9:49pm. This is the only time that matters. In order for South Africa to face the minimum ten overs required for a result to be achieved here, they have to re-start by then. For those following around the world, it’s currently 9:15pm in Sydney.It’s raining properly now. Overs will start to be deducted from South Africa’s chase in the next few minutes. Of course, we already lost half an hour earlier. Send in the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern calculations. I’ll try and get those up shortly. Sigh. The big covers are coming on. During the final over the rain started to fall but as the players left the field it got heavy enough to get the ground staff out there. A reminder that to constitute a game, South Africa will need to be out there for ten overs. But we’re still a long way from that with a fair bit of time on the clock.South Africa have given themselves a great chance. It’s raining, which helps batting teams at night. They’re chasing, which is almost always preferred in T20. And they have done the job with the ball, keeping Australia to a very chaseable target. Forget about rain, reserve days and reduced overs, the Proteas have done the job so far. The pressure now transfers to Meg Lanning’s strike bowlers. 20th over: Australia 134-5 (Lanning 49, Carey 7) Much better from Khaka, prompting a quick single that would have ran out Lanning with a direct hit. Carey then takes a big swing but misses. She gets the single from the fourth ball, leaving Lanning two attempts to go big. She can’t from penultimate delivery, having to settle with two to midwicket. And she can’t from the final ball either, finishing with a single in the same direction. Two superb overs to finish for South Africa. 19th over: Australia 128-5 (Lanning 45, Carey 5) Nic Carey has to deliver here too - find the rope or give the strike to Lanning. Ismail keeps her quiet to begin and when the captain does get on strike, nearly slips a yorker through the gate. Oooh! The short ball is so close to getting her next up! Lanning tried to pull and it went straight in the air before nearly landing on her stumps! Ismail, in her follow through, nearly made it in time with a e... but not quite. An exceptional death over five off it. And Carey, not Lanning, is on strike to start the 20th over.18th over: Australia 124-5 (Lanning 45, Carey 3) Khaka returns to bowl overs 18 and 20, presumably. South Africa have done so well putting the brakes on Lanning through the middle overs but they aren’t going to stop her hammering a full toss through cover for four. Help yourself stuff. van Niekerk wants her seamer to follow Lanning and it isn’t working either, four leg byes added and a legside wide too. To finish, the captain stays in her crease and leans into a drive rather than backing away, bisecting the ring through point with perfect timing. That’s the big over they really needed to break this open again - 17 from it. Your move, South Africa.17th over: Australia 107-5 (Lanning 36, Carey 2) What a fine spell that was from the 20-year-old, brought back into the team tonight to do a job and do a job she did, finishing with 319. That could very well be the making of her. Good enough pace, plenty of movement through the air, accurate throughout. Super stuff.HAS DE KLERK TRAPPED LANNING? She insists that DVN sends it upstairs for a look with the DRS... but she’s wrong to do so. The Australian skipper hit it.Bowled her! de Klerk has done it again! Haynes picked this as the over to go big and made room outside the leg stump to the first delivery but didn’t make contact. That’s the second time the seamer has hit the woodwork she has 316. 16th over: Australia 104-4 (Lanning 35, Haynes 17) DVN goes to Tryon again, which is a touch surprising, but the over only goes for nine which isn’t a terrible result at this stage of the innings. They score from every ball, scampering between the wickets, but without adding a boundary. The 100 is raised in the process. Right, “rain is on the way” says Isa Guha, due to hit in 20 minutes. Matt Bonser makes an interesting point on the email to me: if Australia know the rain is coming is it not in their interests to declare to ensure that South Africa get ten overs at the crease to guarantee a finish? I’m not even sure if that’s permitted in a T20? 15th over: Australia 95-4 (Lanning 33, Haynes 10) Shot! Lanning advances at Mlaba and plays a beautiful lofted drive over cover, into the gap and away for a boundary. The spinner kept it together though, only giving up three other singles. Five overs to go, can Australia push it to 140-145? These two should be able to.14th over: Australia 88-4 (Lanning 28, Haynes 8) When does Lanning pull the trigger, I wonder? She raced to 15 before the wickets fell, then put it away. As Mel Jones says on TV, there have been 35 deliveries without a boundary now. Six runs off Tryon’s second over makes 11 from her two - a very good result from the sixth bowler. That gives van Niekerk all the flexibility she needs for the death overs. 13th over: Australia 82-4 (Lanning 25 Haynes 6) Here comes Ismail again for her third over - a big play from DVN to use her weapon here. In terms of scoreboard pressure, four dot balls do the trick. But you get the feeling watching that over the Australians are happy enough letting her bowl her overs out without much risk. 12th over: Australia 80-4 (Lanning 25 Haynes 5) Tryon is into the attack, South Africa’s sixth bowler. A good time to bring her on from DVN, before Haynes is properly in. Both teams will be happy with five from the over. This is set up nicely.11th over: Australia 75-4 (Lanning 23 Haynes 2) Sure enough, the wickets have dried up the attack, four runs Australia’s lot here after Gardner’s departure. But the good news for the home side is that their two most dependable middle-order operators are in the middle. They know precisely what to do here: accumulate.They have some work to do now! Gardner is gone for a duck! To a delivery well outside the off-stump she took a swing, but with very little footwork to speak of paid the price with a feather through to the gloves of Chetty. They’ve lost 33.10th over: Australia 71-3 (Lanning 21, Gardner 0) An excellent set from Mlaba, taking a wicket then keeping Lanning and Gardner to one run between them. They’re quickly working their way back into this after Lanning’s big over.And it doesn’t last! Jonassen has a crack at Mlaba straight away but doesn’t get anywhere near enough of it, Ismail taking a safe catch coming in from long-on. Difficult to understand why she was in ahead of Haynes or Gardner. 9th over: Australia 70-2 (Lanning 20, Jonassen 1) Jess Jonassen at No4! I didn’t see that coming. They’re really invested in this leftright thing, aren’t they? Bowled her! Mooney danced at the medium pacer and tried to flick through midwicket but missed, the ball going on to uproot leg stump. With the opener looking set, that’s just as important as the Healy dismissal for South Africa.8th over: Australia 64-1 (Mooney 28, Lanning 15) Oooh, that’s a superb shot from Lanning, dancing down at her opposing number van Niekerk and lofting her over the rope at extra cover for SIX! “Classic Lanning!” says Isa Guha on telly. Indeed it is. Without the insurance of Perry, the skipper is even more important tonight.7th over: Australia 54-1 (Mooney 27, Lanning 6) With the field out, Nadine de Klerk is into the attack with her medium pace for the first time tonight, brought into the side for Kapp. And just what you want for the seventh over: six runs, carefully accumulated. Mooney knows how to lay a base in the middle overs.6th over: Australia 48-1 (Mooney 25, Lanning 3) Dane van Niekerk is a big-time performer and she knows this ground well, a member of the Sydney Sixers in the WBBL. Mooney plays her very nicely first up, sweeping carefully into the gap for four. She does again to finish the power play, hopping down the track and getting to the pitch of a legbreak, timing it through cover for four more! Mooney’s away.“I’m a bit (lot) to the party but I’m really loving the women’s cricket,” tweets Marizanne Webb to me. “Having it on free to air at work-friendly time with excellent commentators, starting to know players - which is so important for a general punter like myself.” Absolutely. Just as it was with the Women’s Big Bash in those crucial early seasons, they built it and people came (and watched on TV). 5th over: Australia 37-1 (Mooney 15, Lanning 2) Lanning walks out rather than Gardner. They copped a bit of stick about doing this in their previous game too. I don’t get why people get so agitated about these matters in T20 cricket but there we have it. The skipper is off the mark from the final ball of the successful over, steering a couple. Before the wicket, Mooney slapped a boundary through cover.  Taken at midwicket! The skipper had to jump to take it above her head but timed the movement perfectly. Khaka gets the huge wicket after she was dropped in the previous over. They know how big that could be in a couple of hours from now.4th over: Australia 29-0 (Healy 18, Mooney 10) Mlaba has bowled a lot of overs in the power play and comes on now with the field up to send down her left-arm orthodox. A couple of singles to the sweepers to begin before Healy takes the spin on down the ground, hammering consecutive boundaries. That was where she scored so heavily in her player-of-the-match performance against Bangladesh last week. OOH! DROPPED TO FINISH! Chetty has put Healy down behind the stumps! It was a tough chance, the edge coming when Healy was deep in the crease attempting to cut. In and out it went. So close to a huge moment. 3rd over: Australia 18-0 (Healy 9, Mooney 9) A top contest between two of the best competitors in the women’s game, Healy taking Ismail on through cover in the air for four. So well struck. But the pocket-rocket quick bounces back the only way she knows: with a rapid bouncer. Great stuff. Earlier in the set, Mooney picked up her first boundary too, an unconvincing shovel through the onside. 2nd over: Australia 9-0 (Healy 5, Mooney 4) Ayabonga Khaka is taking the new ball from the other end with Marizanne Kapp missing this semi-final with illness. She’s slightly too full to begin at Mooney, who steers her nicely through cover for a couple. Three quality dots follow, the last of those beating Mooney with a lovely bit of shape away from the left-hander. Oooh, Healy takes a huge swing at the final delivery, going within a ball-width of taking out her off-stump. Again, plenty of movement. The South African seamers have started very nicely indeed.1st over: Australia 6-0 (Healy 5, Mooney 1) A dangerous start from Ismail, beating Healy on the outside edge with her first ball and then the inside edge second up. It prompts a huge appeal for leg before, turned down by Nitin Menon. van Niekerk elects not to send it upstairs, the ball trending just down the legside by her assessment. Good call. Healy gets Australia going later in the over with a slap over cover point, taking full advantage of some extra width. Mooney gets her first look from the final ball of this first over and tucks it around the corner for a single. The players are on the field. No anthems, straight into it. Good stuff. Alyssa Healy will be taking the first ball of this second semi final, to be sent down by Shabnim Ismail, the quickest bowler in the women’s game. And here we go! PLAY! No hesitation from Dane van Niekerk. “If we want to get to the final we have to beat the defending champions.” Big news: Marizanne Kapp is not fit to play, having not recovered from the virus that struck her down earlier this week.Meg Lanning is happy with the pitch. Of course, Ellyse Perry is out injured with Annabel Sutherland also omitted. In their place is Sophie Molineux, comes in for her first game of the tournament and Delissa Kimmince returns as well.Would you believe it: a full game is scheduled! Provided the rain stays away.Some comments from England captain, Heather Knight. Her said were washed out of the competition earlier today, India going through as the higher qualifier. “It’s a horrible way to exit a tournament. There’s obviously nothing we could have done and to not get the chance to go out there and play for a place in the final is gutting. I really hope that we’re the last team who ever exit an ICC tournament in this way. We’ve been bridesmaids before but to lose out to rain is a new feeling.”Make of this what you will, the TV broadcast has left the SCG and we’re back to highlights of old World Cups. As a rule, that means they have been told we are quite a long way from any meaningful action - i.e. a toss, in the first instance. A reminder, if you are new to the OBO, that you can hit me up on the email with your considered thoughts, or you can ping me a hot take via twitter.All eyes turn to the rain radar. For a lifetime local cricketer and journalist on the game, I’ve never been particularly good at interpreting the radar. But from a quick look at the BOM, it appears as though more rain might hit the SCG later. So, the first milestone here is getting the ground as dry as possible and holding a toss. The first we have seen of the pitch. Due to all the rain, it is going to take plenty of work to get the outfield up to scratch. But as I noted earlier today, we know how quickly the SCG groundstaff got the job done for the Big Bash final last month. If you’re just catching up, there is no reserve day for these semi-finals. As a result, India have already qualified for the decider without a ball being bowled in Sydney earlier today, England having to taste that bitter pill. We went into the elements of that earlier today on the OBO if you wish to read through. Needless to say, if they don’t get on the field this evening, there’s going to be one hell of a backlash. Both because this wasn’t planned for to begin with and also because administrators ruled out trying to fix the problem earlier this week when heavy rain was forecast. Hello again! For those who were with me earlier for the rained out first semi, we’ll maintain the same pretence (for the sake of sanity) and prepare as though there will be a start at the scheduled time. Of course, that won’t happen - and whether they can get on later for a ten-over smash is anyone’s guess - but let’s give it a go.For Australia, it remains as it has since losing their tournament opener against India - they just have to win. For themselves as a team, to deliver on the promise of their dominance in this format, and for those who have invested so much in trying to fill the MCG for Sunday’s final on International Women’s Day. If they play as they did against New Zealand on Monday, they are well placed: it was a far more comprehensive victory than the four-run margin suggested. That the SCG is the ground where Alyssa Healy and Ash Gardner have done some of their best work can only help, too. Not that it offsets the loss of Ellyse Perry. It will be interesting at the toss what they do there. For mine, I’d include Delissa Kimmince. All that experience and variety never should have been dropped.As for South Africa, the main question is whether their own superstar all-rounder, Marizanne Kapp, will be fit to play - she has been knocked around with a virus. This is the Proteas third semi in major tournaments, the most recent coming at the 2017 ODI World Cup when they came ever so close to knocking off the hosts in a thriller. After beating England in their first game here – undefeated thereafter – they have earned their status as the team who to progress if the rain doesn’t stop. It will need to by 8:36pm local - that’s when we need to see the toss held, (with a start at 8:51pm ) - in order to get the ten overs in for both teams. The attitude from the groundstaff will be simple: whatever it takes. If they can’t, it will be a dreadful way for the hosts and defending champions to bow out. Stand by."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c737848a49704f447447f06c4440b3f0d0d0bc0a/0_637_2850_1709/master/2850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d800432c6c8098c2c86b8bbd599c1174","title":"coriolanus shakespeare laurence olivier ralph fiennes ian mckellan","story":"From Olivier’s strangled fury to Ralph Fiennes’ Oedipal embraces, this complex political play is extraordinarily flexible‘The tragedy of Coriolanus is one of the most amusing of our author’s performances.” So wrote Dr Johnson – but I’m not sure that “amusing” is the word that leaps to mind when thinking of Shakespeare’s play, which Robert Hastie is directing at the Crucible, Sheffield. With its intransigent hero, its struggles between Rome’s patricians and plebeians and its austere language, it is more often thought to be a somewhat forbidding work. Yet I would argue that it is far and away Shakespeare’s most complex political play – its meaning changes depending on the context in which it is produced and the attitude of its interpreters.History confirms its contentiousness. A production at the Comédie Française in 1934 prompted standing ovations for the hero’s anti-democratic tirades and was for a time suspended by the French president. Yet, shortly after, it was staged by the Maly theatre in Moscow as a critical attack on “a superman who had detached himself from the people and betrayed them”. Brecht also did his own Marxist adaptation, staged by the Berliner Ensemble in 1964, which portrayed the downfall of “the inidual who blackmails society with his indispensability”. So is it a quasi-fascist play in praise of a superhero or a study of the dialectic of history? It all depends on the society in which it is being produced.Since Hastie’s production is being staged in contemporary costume, it is fair to assume that it won’t exactly offer a ringing endorsement of Coriolanus’s militaristic values. Yet the virtue of the play lies in its ambivalence about its hero. On one level, Coriolanus is an arrogant patrician who denies the starving Romans their corn, is most alive in war and fails to realise that consular power depends on popular support.But he also refuses to accept the spoils of war, shows exemplary kindness to a prisoner who offered him shelter and eventually signs his own death warrant by surrendering to his mother’s entreaty not to march on the Rome that has banished him. Seeing his mother and family arriving on their mercy mission, he says: “I melt, and am not  Of stronger earth than others.” John Barton, who directed the play in 1967, saw these lines as central, a sign of how Coriolanus is finally forced by circumstance to know himself.That ambivalence is visible in many of the productions I have seen. As someone old enough, and lucky enough, to have seen Laurence Olivier play Coriolanus at Stratford in 1959, I recall how he humanised the character. He was a superb fighting machine but found unexpected irony in the part: urged by Volumnia to moderate his anger towards the plebs, he silently mouthed the final word in “mildly be it then, mildly”, thereby earning a legitimate laugh. But Olivier also brought out the tragic nature of the hero’s dependence on his mother. In response to being described by Aufidius as “thou boy of tears”, Olivier shrieked the word “Boy!” in what Kenneth Tynan vividly described as “an outburst of strangled fury”.Coriolanus’s intense relationship with his mother is rightly seized on these days as a key to the play. It was there in a 2000 production by Jonathan Kent, where Ralph Fiennes’s hero was partnered by Barbara Jefford as Volumnia – who at one point held her son in a fierce, sensual embrace. In Fiennes’s own fine film version in 2011, Vanessa Redgrave gave a superb study of the poker-backed, uniformed mum glowing with pride at her son’s military conquests.The play’s complexity is reinforced by a growing awareness of its homoeroticism. It is all there in the text, not least when Coriolanus’s Volscian rival Aufidius recounts his dreams: “We have been down together in my sleep,  Unbuckling helms, fisting each other’s throat.” I’ve never forgotten how, in a Tyrone Guthrie production in Nottingham in 1963, Ian McKellen’s Aufidius flung himself on the dead body of John Neville’s Coriolanus as if over a lost lover. When McKellen himself played Coriolanus in Peter Hall’s 1984 National Theatre production, Greg Hicks as Aufidius delivered a large portion of the speech quoted above in the arms of his former enemy.There is no end to the subtleties of this remarkable play. You can see the hero as an overmothered general, such as Olivier, or as a lonely dragon, as Alan Howard did in a 1977 Terry Hands production, or as a tragically flawed figure such as Hicks in David Farr’s 2002 revival. You can play the people’s tribunes as manipulative villains or shrewd pragmatists. You can give the play a rightwing or leftwing spin depending on the nature of the times and your personal viewpoint. But Gregory Doran, the RSC’s director who staged the play in 2007, got it right when he said: “The play is too complex, too multifaceted to be reduced to a single political perspective. Shakespeare sees both sides, empathises with both and yet is critical of both.” The play may not be overly amusing, despite what Dr Johnson said, but in that multi-dimensionality lies its greatness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1918f96d7e259a4e343e04d842c0b6675bff3a74/396_290_4532_2720/master/4532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03c3ddb20c10889832cc2dcf115b9309","title":"10 smaller european capitals of culture you may not have heard of","story":"It’s not just major European cities that benefit from the award, many other destinations have received a cultural boost over the 35 years of the projectIn 1983, Melina Mercouri, the then Greek minister of culture, proposed a scheme to celebrate art, history and heritage across Europe. By putting a different city in the spotlight each year, Mercouri hoped to showcase the continent’s cultural ersity, while highlighting shared values. The European Capital of Culture programme, which was established in 1985, has been a huge success, with more than 60 cities receiving a profile boost (two or more cities now often share the annual honour).The scheme shows off cultural life and helps to attract visitors but has also helped regenerate deprived areas, particularly in former industrial cities, such as Glasgow, the UK’s first capital of culture, in 1990, Lille (2004) and Essen (2010). In 2013, it helped Košice in Slovakia make the transition from a manufacturing centre to the tourism hub for the Carpathian region. That year’s co-capital, Marseille, benefited from an investment project of more than €600m and major new attractions including the award-winning Mucem. More recently, a record 5.8 million tourists visited Leeuwarden in the Netherlands during its 2018 tenure, generating €300m.For Turku, in Finland, its year (2011) was “a gamechanger”, according to Olga Henriksson from Visit Turku. New bars and restaurants have opened in what is now considered the country’s food capital new arts venues, walking routes and bridges have been built, and there are plans for a history museum and concert hall. The city also teamed up with the university to research the benefits of culture on wellbeing, with doctors giving “cultural prescriptions” to patients (such as free tickets to plays) and events taking place in schools and care homes. Combining culture with wellbeing remains part of the city strategy.This year’s capitals, Galway City in Ireland and Rijeka in Croatia, will hope to reap similar benefits. But as this is an EU scheme, the UK is no longer able to participate. British cities including Dundee, Nottingham and Leeds were preparing bids for 2023, but are ineligible after Brexit. That means Liverpool, the UK’s second European Capital of Culture in 2008, is also its last.Many major cities have held the title, including Berlin, Paris and Madrid, but plenty of smaller, lesser-known gems have made the cut, too. Here are 10 under-the-radar cultural capitals that are well worth a visit.Norway’s second city is surrounded by seven hills and seven fjords. The city itself is easy on the eye, too, especially Unesco-listed Bryggen, the old wharf quarter, with its wooden buildings, alleyways and craft shops, and backstreets crowded with clapboard houses. Learn about the city’s trading history at its Hanseatic Museum (a ticket also includes entry to the Fisheries Museum) visit the four art galleries under the Kode umbrella, including one devoted to Edvard Munch and attend a concert at Edvard Grieg’s summerhouse. Bergen is also a gateway to the fjords and has hiking trails on its doorstep – several can be reached via the Fløibanen funicular to the top of Mount Fløyen.Where to stay Marken Gjestehus, a bright guesthouse in a former bakery, has private rooms and dorms (dorms from £15, doubles from £45).• Read more: A family weekend in BergenThis city of golden sandstone in western Spain is home to the oldest university in the Hiic world – granted its charter in 1218 – whose beautiful library is open to visitors. Another of Salamanca’s claims to fame is its two cathedrals, the old and the new daily tours take in both, including access to the terraces and watchtower for views over the city. The Plaza Mayor, or central square, is a huge baroque-design space with 88 arches and carvings of figures such as Miguel de Cervantes. The Art Nouveau and Art Deco Museum is worth visiting for the building alone, a modernista palace of stained-glass windows, never mind the creepy collection of 300 porcelain dolls. Other sights include churches and monasteries, and the Casa de las Conchas, a historic building decorated with hundreds of scallop shells. Where to stay Hospes Palacio de San Esteban is a hotel in a converted monastery in the old town, with an outdoor pool and terraces overlooking the cathedrals (doubles from £96).It may not be the most beautiful of places – a slightly gritty port and university city – but Patra has 3,000 years of history, lively squares and low prices to make up for it. The world-class archaeological museum displays Mycenaean ceramics and Roman sculptures and mosaics the flamboyant cathedral is the biggest church in Greece and a climb to the medieval castle is rewarded with views over Zakynthos and Kefalonia. Other places to visit include the poet Kostis Palamas’s house and the Roman Odeon. Nights out tend to start from Plateia Georgiou, the vast central square, which is also the site of the neoclassical Apollon theatre. The best way to arrive is over the graceful, 2km-long Rio-Antirrio suspension bridge.Where to stay City Loft is a modern apart-hotel with balconies and a garden, just north of the centre (doubles from £59.• Read more: Victoria Hislop – “Patra represents the extremes of Greece”This Saxon city in Transylvania was once one of the most important fortified cities in central Europe, guarded by 39 towers. A handful remain, including the Council Tower, which visitors can climb – although the gothic St Mary’s Evangelical church has the biggest tower of all at 73 metres (also open to visitors). Another architectural feature are the city’s “eyes”: eyelid-shaped windows in the red rooftops. Today, Sibiu is a festival hotspot, with a renowned theatre event in June, plus art, film, jazz, rock and other festivals. Museums include the art gallery in Brukenthal Palace and the Pharmacy Museum. For winter holidays, the Paltinis ski resort is less than an hour’s drive away.Where to stay The boutique Art Hotel in the old town, 200m from the main square (doubles from £40).Cutting-edge Linz is a Unesco city of media arts (where art meets technology). The centre of this scene is the Ars Electronica Center on the north bank of the Danube, where visitors can watch artificial intelligence “thinking”, train self-driving cars, programme robots, print in 3D and process their own DNA with gene scissors. The museum holds a festival each September, with concerts, exhibitions and screenings. Street art has its own home at Mural Harbour, where there are graffiti artworks all over the port area – tourists can take a boat tour and a crash course in spray cans and stencils. The Lentos, an eye-catching glass building that is illuminated at night, is the city’s modern art museum, with work by Klimt, Schiele and others. It’s not all modern, though – Linz also has an old town with handsome baroque buildings.Where to stay Arte Hotel Linz reopened last year as a modern, art-filled hotel, three minutes’ walk from Ars Electronica (doubles from £95).• Read more: No chintz in LinzFinland’s oldest city is built on either side of the River Aura, with the cathedral on one bank and the castle on the other, and plenty of waterfront bars and restaurants. Kaskis is the pick of its clutch of New Nordic restaurants, serving a six-course tasting menu featuring lots of foraged forest ingredients (€69). There are a dozen engaging small museums within walking distance, such as the Sibelius Museum, which has weekly indoor and outdoor concerts, and the open-air Handicrafts Museum, showing traditional wooden buildings that survived the Great Fire of 1827. The city is on the edge of an archipelago of about 20,000 islands, best explored by bike or kayak. Where to stay The Turun Seurahuone was designed in the 1920s by the Finnish architect Erik Bryggman and serves a lavish breakfast buffet (doubles from £148).• Read more: City break in Turku – where the Finnish startedGuimarães is known as the birthplace of Portugal, as Afonso Henriques, the first independent king, is believed to have been born here in 1110. Its well-preserved medieval centre is a Unesco-listed tangle of lanes and plazas, and there are churches, a 15th-century palace and a 1,000-year-old castle to visit. Thanks to its year as culture capital, there are new arts spaces – notably the Plataforma das Artes e Criatividade on the old market square – and new restaurants, including Michelin-starred A Cozinha. A cable car trundles visitors up to Mount Penha, a picturesque viewpoint about 7km away. Further afield, Braga and Porto make easy day trips.Where to stay The EMAJ boutique hotel, in the converted national bank on the main square (doubles from £57).This Bohemian city is best known for its beer: pilsner was first brewed here in 1842 and is still produced today. Drinkers can go on a brewery tour, visit the Brewery Museum – or just sample the wares in one of the many pubs. Another legacy of this industry is Pilsen’s network of underground tunnels, which date back to the 14th century – daily tours explore the passageways, cellars and wells. The historic centre has a gothic cathedral on the main square and a Grand Synagogue, while family-friendly attractions include the Techmania Science Centre, DinoPark, Puppet Museum and zoo. DEPO2015 is a cultural centre with interesting food, fashion and other events – a current exhibition focuses on Czech football. The city is at the confluence of four rivers, with lots of green space.Where to stay Vienna House Easy Pilsen is opposite the brewery, a few minutes’ walk from the old town (doubles from £57).• Read more: Pilsen – capital of culture 2015Since it was founded by Vikings in the eight century, Denmark’s second city has undergone a lot of changes – many over the last decade. The docklands have been regenerated to form a new district, Aarhus Ø, which has a network of canals a harbour bath and a sea-swimming course an observation tower with views over the city and the bay and the landmark Iceberg building. Elsewhere, architectural highlights include Olafur Eliasson’s rainbow-coloured skywalk on the roof of the ARoS art gallery the summer-only Infinite Bridge, a circular boardwalk by Varna beach and Den Gamle By, an open-air museum with 19th-century buildings. Aarhus is also an emerging foodie destination, from the global goodies on offer at Aarhus Street Food market to fine dining at four Michelin-starred restaurants.

But nothing is certain as counting continues: ‘It’s like a black box’Bernie Sanders was declared the winner in California just moments after polls closed but his final haul of delegates could remain uncertain for days, or even weeks, as election officials tally the millions of provisional votes and mail-in ballots.And while triumph in the Golden State will help Sanders remain competitive in what has become essentially a two-person race between him and Joe Biden, the eventual delegate math could indicate a decidedly shakier path to the nomination than the Vermont senator expected last week.Voting on Super Tuesday in Los Angeles county, the state’s most populous, was marked by chaos after a $300m new voting system resulted in hours-long lines that kept people waiting even as midnight approached. Meanwhile, nearly half the state’s ballots still remain uncounted, estimates Paul Mitchell, with the campaign research firm Political Data Inc, which tracks ballots as they are returned.Many voters dropped off or posted ballots at the last minute, and election officials are required to count mail-ins that arrive as late as Friday, as long as they are postmarked by 3 March.After all the volatility, withdrawals and endorsements leading up Super Tuesday, many California voters said they felt torn as they headed to the polls – and even after they’d voted.Stephenie Smith, 31, told the  she had made a last-minute decision to vote for Warren. “After a lot of conversations, I was kind of leaning toward Bernie,” she said. “I had such mixed feelings.” But on election night, she was worried she’d made the wrong choice. “I like Warren slightly better, but I didn’t want to have split the progressive vote,” she said.Voters who had their hearts set on Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, or other candidates who dropped out before the election were left scrambling as well. Andrew Byrnes, 47, said he settled on Joe Biden, “because I think he’s the most likely to defeat Trump”, he said. “I was torn between him and Warren, but it doesn’t seem like she has a chance of winning.”Traditionally, the demographics of late voters tend to resemble the types who would favor Sanders, Mitchell said. In California, the Sanders campaign’s early outreach to a dedicated coalition of young, liberal and Latino voters appeared to dull the impact of Biden’s momentum. Exit polls across the country, however, suggested that late deciders tended to side with Biden.As more votes are counted, support for Mike Bloomberg – who is currently in third place – is likely to wane, Mitchell said.Whatever the final numbers, Sanders, who has long dominated in state polls, is sure to retain his strong lead in a state where his progressive politics resonate with a Democratic electorate that skews left, said Erick Schickler, the co-director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.At an election night watch party in San Francisco’s Mission district, Sanders supporters cheered and clapped as bar TVs blared news of the lefty candidate’s resounding victory.Kyle Schmolze, 30, said he felt “better about progressive politics than I’ve ever felt in my life”. Sanders’ sweep in California was heartening. “It feels like we can actually win,” he said.But his candidate’s losses in the east and south worried Schmolze. “I would feel safer if Bernie had dominated – which is what I had expected,” he said. “I’m feeling all the emotions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0525da8b38f8832932bdf0c1e1d01dcb93409c8b/0_195_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3c519c59a5617cb5102bd2179eb4925","title":"joe biden jim clyburn endorsement super tuesday","story":"Biden won South Carolina – and days later, Super Tuesday – after Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American Democrat in Congress, backed himWhen the House majority whip, Jim Clyburn, endorsed Joe Biden ahead of the South Carolina primary it effectively set off a series of events that resulted in the former vice-president trouncing his rivals in the Super Tuesday primary contests on Tuesday night.Before Clyburn’s endorsement, Biden’s lead in South Carolina had shrunk to single digits. It was an ominous sign for a candidate who underperformed in the first three Democratic primary contests and whose campaign stressed that South Carolina would serve as a firewall.Biden’s ties to the African American community there, who make up the majority of Democratic voters, go back decades and the idea was that those relationships would carry him to victory in the state.But then candidate Tom Steyer, a billionaire, was making an aggressive play to win over black voters in South Carolina. And Bernie Sanders’ aggressive campaign and grassroots supporters in the state were helping the Vermont senator make gains.With just days to go before the 29 February primary, Clyburn hadn’t endorsed anyone and every candidate wanted it. He is the highest-ranking African American Democrat in Congress and an influential figure in his home state of South Carolina.Clyburn, before his eventual endorsement, conceded that Biden’s rivals were gaining ground.“These things usually tighten up when you get close to an election. So, we don’t know. We will find out in about 10 days,” Clyburn said in an interview with CNN.Then came the endorsement.“You cannot overstate the impact of Clyburn on South Carolina Democratic politics,” said Isaac Wright, a Democratic strategist and partner at the Forward Solution Strategy Group. To be sure, Biden’s recent success was not singly due to one endorsement. He had always polled ahead of the rest of the field in South Carolina and he had been methodically picking up endorsements there. But Clyburn’s public backing helped cement Biden’s legitimacy among the Democratic electorate in the 2020 primary.Following Biden’s decisive victory in South Carolina on Saturday, his main moderate rivals within the primary, the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg and the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, quickly dropped out of the race and endorsed him. Other endorsements, including the coveted backing of former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, Barack Obama’s US ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and former candidate Beto O’Rourke, flooded in for Biden.“That substantive victory in South Carolina is what set off a chain reaction in the next few days – the Buttigieg endorsement, the Klobuchar endorsement and what amounts to all but a clean sweep on Super Tuesday,” Wright added.The endorsement came just a few days before the election but Biden’s poll numbers had begun to tick up dramatically and he won the state by about 30 percentage points.“Black voters turned out and they had their voices heard and they are on the trajectory of propelling Joe Biden to be the Democratic nominee. Clyburn’s endorsement was part of a flood of good fortune for Biden,” said Eric Goldman, a Democratic consultant.Goldman noted though that Clyburn’s endorsement was just one part of the turnaround. Goldman stressed Biden’s “longstanding” ties to the African American community.That victory seems to have set off a domino effect of support among Democratic voters in southern states and minorities. In the 14 primary contests on Tuesday, Biden won every southern state. According to exit polling Biden’s victories in some of these key states were largely thanks to strong support among minority voters.And on Wednesday, Biden’s remaining moderate rival in the primary, the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, dropped out and endorsed him.The Super Tuesday victories for Biden also elevated him back into frontrunner status. He came away from Super Tuesday with more delegates than Sanders and the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren.Biden’s turnaround, from a campaign on life support with no victories and dwindling cash to frontrunner, had happened in an eight-day period, with Clyburn’s endorsement marking the beginning of the dramatic change.  A day after Super Tuesday Clyburn, again speaking on CNN, admitted he was surprised with the extent of Biden’s victories the night before.“I was a bit surprised: it did go better than many of us expected,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab83df697d954348e4a87aa2738ad6bf9a978d00/0_0_3556_2312/master/3556.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8c669db4cb3c9e6b24d349af05e673e1 2020w","title":"construction starts in netherlands on longest cycling bridge in europe","story":"The 800-metre Blauwe Loper will only be accessible to cyclists, pedestrians – and batsConstruction has started in the Netherlands on what will be Europe’s longest bridge for cyclists and pedestrians – stretching over a lake, canal, motorway and nature reserve – to connect a new village to its closest town.The so-called “Blue carpet bridge”, or Blauwe Loper, will be 800 metres long, but there are plans to ultimately extend it to 1km in length. The first phase is scheduled for completion by next Christmas.The bridge will only be accessible to cyclists and pedestrians – and bats. Its LED lighting has been designed to assist the creatures in finding their way from the nearby nature reserve to the Oldambtmeer lake. The bridge will also be painted in “bat-friendly” green.The bridge has been designed to last for at least 80 years despite being made from wood, which was sourced from Gabon in Central Africa.Reinder Lanting, a project leader told the Dagblad van het Noorden, a regional daily: “We think we can stretch it to a kilometre by connecting it to the main street in Blauwestad.“This bridge is not going to rot. That is because it is technically well designed. The wood is not pressed together but has a sort of venting system.”Local dignitaries joined an event to watch the laying of the concrete foundations of the bridge. The Dutch cycling embassy, a government-funded agency, tweeted: “The province of Groningen has started construction on the €6.5m, 800-metre Blauwe Loper … When completed in late 2020, it will be the longest bicycle bridge in Europe.”The Blauwe Loper will surpass Europe’s current longest cyclists’ bridge, which is in Sölvesborg, southern Sweden. The 756-metre bridge extends across Sölvesborg Bay.Both bridges are dwarfed, however, by the Xiamen Bicycle Skyway in China. Developed by the Danish design firm Dissing + Weitling, it is 7.6km long.

Google’s European headquarters in Dublin are empty as its staff of 8,000 work from home to avoid spreading the virus.But how best to work from home if you’ve never done it before? The experts weigh in.“Engage with the possibility that you might need to work from home now, rather than on day one of having to do it,” suggests Matthew Knight of Leapers, a community that supports the mental health of freelancers and the self-employed. “Make sure you have all the technology you’ll need set up already, so you’re set to go from day one.”If you aren’t in quarantine, try not to spend all day cooped up indoors. “Get out of the house at least once a day,” advises Anna Codrea-Rado, the founder of the Professional Freelancer, a newsletter and community for self-employed workers, and co-host of the Is This Working? podcast. “Even if it’s just going to the shops. You’ll get cabin fever otherwise.”Make sure you are taking proper breaks. “One of the joys of working from home is that you can cook a proper meal,” says Codrea-Rado. If you’re worried that people will think you’re slacking, tell your co-workers that you’re logging off for lunch, to avoid being disturbed.Codrea-Rado encourages you to not work from your sofa, or worse still, your bed. “Have a dedicated place to work, even if it’s just the end of your kitchen table,” she says. “It helps you get in the mind frame of work. If you don’t, it muddies the boundaries between home life and work life – working from your sofa all day and then sitting there watching TV doesn’t feel as relaxing.”But don’t feel you need to put on a suit. “People say don’t work in your pyjamas,” she adds. “But I really disagree with that. The beauty of working from home is that you don’t have to think about the optics of how you’re working, you just have to focus on getting your work done.”Many of the people working from home due to coronavirus will usually work from offices. To make the transition as smooth as possible, Corea-Rado advises managers to establish ground rules. “Set the tone for how the team is going to work from home,” she says. “Schedule regular one-to-one check-ins and explain how and when you’d like people to report back to you.”Although it is tempting to just send an email, Knight advises making the effort to call co-workers or employees whenever you can, particularly if you are a manager, to check in on their mental wellbeing. “Ask them how they are doing and really listen to the answer,” he says.If you’re feeling low, let people know. “Don’t just suffer in silence,” he says. “Let your manager or co-workers know how you’re feeling. Nine times out of 10, sharing how you’re feeling with people really helps.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8db384f3f791a183b01a0af87b430f8d9787db76/0_119_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=983807113314eb810514471c3556ced8","title":"israel arab parties make historic gains election support surges","story":"Joint List alliance capitalises on backlash against Netanyahu by taking 15 seats in KnessetArab politicians are set to make historic gains in the Israeli election, taking more seats than ever before and solidifying their position as the third-largest force in the Knesset, the country’s parliament.Boosted by a backlash to racist campaigning by Benjamin Netanyahu, Arab candidates also capitalised on anger towards the prime minister’s ally, Donald Trump. The US president’s recently-released “peace plan” included a highly-controversial clause that could strip some Arab-Israelis of their citizenship.Since the 2015 election, Netanyahu has warned his supporters that the minority could vote en masse to block him from power. Five years later, it appeared they might have succeeded.“We know that the Arabs came to the polling stations in droves,” said the chairman of the Joint List, Ayman Odeh, in comments that mockingly mirrored Netanyahu’s derogatory language from 2015. “It was clear to everyone that the Joint List was leading the battle against any rightwing government,” Odeh added.While no Arab party has ever served in an Israeli governing coalition due to ideological differences, any Joint List gains will serve to dampen Netanyahu’s chances of leading the next government. While his Likud party won the most votes of any faction, Netanyahu’s alliance with ultranationalist and religious allies is still short of two or three seats to secure a clear majority.“As far as we are concerned, we’ve already done our part. We’ve stopped Netanyahu’s far-right government,” said Dean Issacharoff, a spokesman for Ayman Odeh.Unless Netanyahu can persuade other opposition politicians to defect, Israel’s political stalemate will almost certainly continue, with the possibility of another complete breakdown and a fourth election.In last April’s election, Arab candidates, including communists, Islamists, secularists and Palestinian nationalists, claimed 10 seats. After they unified into the Joint List alliance in September, they pushed that figure up to 13, promising better services but also to present a bulwark against anti-Arab policies.This time, the Joint List also sought to win votes from progressive Jewish Israelis, some of whom are dismayed with traditionally leftwing Jewish candidates, who have seen their influence plummet as domestic politics lurches rightwards.Meretz, a small Zionist party that opposes the occupation of the Palestinian territories, appeared to have lost voters to the Joint List after it joined forces with the less vocal Labour party. It made the move to risk disappearing from the Knesset altogether, but alienated some supporters.“A lot of leftwing voters were disillusioned or disappointed,” said Issacharoff, adding that the Joint List estimated it had doubled its support from Jewish people. “We’ve never been in a place that is so influential.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a248bae2e17874f6b21d8acfd1aaa43dc3e736/349_506_2976_1785/master/2976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e280d8165861d18a1d04953080a11cc","title":"move to weekly uk coronavirus updates criticised by experts","story":"Decisions raises fears public won’t be able to make informed choices to help control outbreakAs Downing Street confirmed that discussions are taking place on contingency plans to close the Houses of Parliament if the outbreak becomes widespread, 36 new UK cases were announced on Wednesday.Three of the cases are believed to have been contracted within the UK, confirming fears that community transmission is already occurring and that attempts to contain the virus have at least partly failed. In total, 87 people have tested positive in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Health officials faced a backlash over a decision not to release information about where new cases are until a weekly roundup announced each Friday.They said the move was a response to the sheer number of new cases. But a former director at Public Health England (PHE) said the move should be reconsidered to allow the public to make informed choices. It came as:Prof Paul Ashford, former north-west regional director of PHE, criticised the decision not to disclose the locations of new coronavirus cases.“They should be sharing the data as much as possible, to make the public equal partners in tackling this and help them make decisions about their own lives. The public needs to know if it’s in their area on a daily basis,” he said. “The planning documents talk a lot about openness, transparency and public involvement. But that hasn’t applied to what’s been going on for the last three weeks.”Dr Jennifer Cole, biological anthropologist at Royal Holloway, University of London, who carried out research into information exchange during the Ebola crisis, said the move risked the spread of fake news.She said: “I think it’s an incredibly ill-advised decision. If it’s not released officially, it creates an information vacuum and it will be filled by unreliable sources … Containment is going to be down to public behaviour and the public response. To not take into account what the public want leaves the government and NHS open to accusations of not being transparent.”Other countries have been more open about the spread of the virus. Singapore identifies the street where cases are confirmed. And in South Korea, phone alerts signify when users come within 100 metres of a confirmed case, based on government data.In the UK, some local authorities confirmed the location of the latest new cases.The chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, said it was unclear whether the three new person-to-person infections were direct or indirect from someone who has recently travelled from abroad. It is known that many had travelled from Italy. Two were diagnosed in Greater Manchester, two in South Ribble, Lancashire, one in Liverpool, and two in Carlisle – including a member of healthcare staff at the Cumberland Infirmary.King’s College London confirmed to the  that an immunobiology student working in an asthma and allergy research department at Guy’s Hospital in London has tested positive. Several other staff have been advised by NHS England to self-isolate.A university spokesperson said the risk of other staff and students having been exposed to the infection had been deemed low but did not confirm whether the department – within the Southwark hospital – dealt directly with patients.Kings College hospital, in south London, said two recent patients had tested positive for the virus.  understands that visitors are not being admitted to the wards where they were being treated in an effort to contain the virus. Whitty said the UK had probably passed the phase of trying to contain the disease, and was now trying to delay it until the summer. “We think it is likely, not definite, that we will move into onward transmission and an epidemic here in the UK,” he said.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which makes recommendations to ministers on how to deal with crises, is due to meet on Thursday. Its chair, Sir Patrick Vallance, told ITV that any switch from a policy of seeking to contain the virus to one of delaying it would be taken in tandem with World Health Organization advice.The Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has been receiving briefings about the virus, and the commissions of both the Commons and the Lords will have the chance to discuss a possible shutdown when they meet on Monday.Any closure would require legislation for emergency powers that would need to be voted on again every 28 days to stay in place, requiring MPs to come back to parliament. The NASUWT, one of the largest teaching unions in the UK, urged the government to address a surge in incidents of racism and xenophobia in schools linked to coronavirus. The union said it has received increased reports of black and minority ethnic teachers and pupils being subjected to “racist name-calling and intimidation” connected to the Covid-19 outbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6ae90602675ec8fe3537c37b172c3927e061ee3/0_293_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61e76e396a5e59846715c0017113edab","title":"coronavirus minister hints u turn decision stop daily uk updates","story":"Chief medical officer admits ‘communications fumble’ and says updates on geographical spread of the disease will continueThe government has reversed a controversial decision to withhold information about the geographical spread of the coronavirus, as the UK’s chief medical officer admitted a “communications fumble” on the plan.But on Thursday morning Whitty announced a U-turn, saying the government would provide daily updates but they would be delayed by 24 hours to allow time for information to be verified.Speaking to the Commons health committee he said: “I think we had a bit of a communications fumble on this one. We are intending to provide geographical information.“We are intending to have some delay of about 24 hours to be absolutely sure we’ve got the details right. I think we do intend to continue with these geographical things. And in fact, in due course, will use maps and other things to enhance that.”Whitty also said the UK has mainly moved into the “delay phase” of tackling the virus, meaning measures to tackle the disease would be stepped up.He said: “We have moved from a situation where we are mainly in ‘contain’, with some ‘delay’ built in, to we are now mainly ‘delay’,” he said, although elements of the contain process remained in place.The government’s battle plan says of the ‘delay’ phase: “Action that would be considered could include population distancing strategies (such as school closures, encouraging greater home working, reducing the number of large-scale gatherings) to slow the spread of the disease throughout the population, while ensuring the country’s ability to continue to run as normally as possible.”The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Earlier the health minister, Edward Argar, said the government was trying to find a “tech solution” to provide daily updates on the geographical spread of the disease.But Whitty rejected following the example of South Korea, where phone alerts are available to signify when users come within 100 metres of a confirmed case, based on government data.The reversal came as the Scottish government reported three new cases, taking the UK total to 90. Overall, current figures show 80 cases in England, six in Scotland, one in Wales and three in Northern Ireland.Argar, had acknowledged public concerns about a move to delay information about the location of new cases.He told BBC Breakfast the government was “learning every day” and was looking at a “tech solution” to keep the public informed about the spread of the disease.Argar also confirmed that authorities were considering plans to close the Houses of Parliament as a contingency plan if the outbreak became much more widespread.He said: “They are considering a whole range of options to ensure that parliament and those coming to parliament, both visitors, members and staff, are kept safe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a86b008ec66047926154b24a410a827f3668786/0_336_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca8056747959b2f91af981abda5fd3dc","title":"how a small dutch town is shaping the future of your food wageningen netherlands","story":"If an innovative solution to feeding the world’s growing population is to be found, it is likely to come from Wageningen, a quiet corner of Europe that is the nexus of global food science. But at what cost to the environment?In the low-lying Gelderse Valley some 85km east of Amsterdam, a Dutch university is changing how humans eat.There, a bright-eyed press officer with Willy Wonka flair is showing me the miracles of modern food science. One laboratory door swings open to reveal giant, fragrant basil leaves growing under multicoloured lights. In a greenhouse nearby, thousands of tomatoes are suspended mid-air like plump, levitating Buddhas. A few steps away, I shake hands with a world-famous banana scientist, who dreams of introducing Europeans to the many varieties of banana eaten across Asia, Africa and Latin America, and ending the tyranny of the common yellow Cavendish.For miles in every direction, fields bulge with crops in some, drones monitor soil fertility, in others, giant luminescent panels light up greenhouses at night. The press officer is accustomed to impressing visitors. “What do you think?” he asks at every turn.The Netherlands is not a big place. You can drive across the whole country from the north to the south in under four hours. And yet it ranks consistently among the world’s top food exporting nations, in terms of gross value. The country’s surpluses are mind-boggling how does the second largest exporter of tomatoes and onions also produce such outsize quantities of dairy and potatoes, and export more eggs than any nation on Earth? The mystery of how this tiny patch of northern Europe does it draws government delegations, multinational companies and agriculture students from around the world to marvel at the nucleus of the Dutch innovation juggernaut: Wageningen University.Broadly speaking, humankind has two paths to choose from to confront what is about to happen. One option – we innovate our way out. Wageningen’s science addresses some of the biggest problems in our food supply system today: scientists there are developing plant-based meat, vertical farms and gene-editing technology. If the answer to the problem of humanity’s survival is going to come out of a laboratory, there’s a good chance that it will happen in Wageningen. Multinational companies and energetic startups are pouring money into the university the collective brainpower of 8,000 international food scientists is part of the machinery that will determine how humans of the future will eat.Louise Fresco, one of the world’s leading food scientists and president of Wageningen University, has been thinking about how to feed the world since she was 15 years old. In 1967, the budding scientist saw photographs of a famine in Biafra, Nigeria, and awakened to the urgency of global hunger. The images set Fresco off on journeys to Papua New Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where she witnessed scarcity first-hand – in her book, Hamburgers in Paradise, she recalls eating roasted palm beetles and python in tomato sauce on these trips to poverty-stricken countries. “I contemplated how little was available to the world’s population,” she writes.Fresco was born in the aftermath of one of the most traumatic chapters in modern Dutch history, a manmade famine known as the Hunger Winter during the second world war in which about 20,000 Dutch people starved to death in a few months, as wartime rations in some regions fell to 500 calories per day. The echo of this event, encapsulated in the postwar slogan: “hunger – never again”, reverberates through my conversation with Fresco, and through many conversations I have at Wageningen. “I always felt that the coincidence of birth should be translated into some kind of a moral responsibility,” Fresco says in an interview at her office. “There was a great sense that something had to be done, that there is more than just going about your own life and being rich and happy.”The Dutch obsession with agricultural surplus is at the heart of the story of Europe. In the years after the war, the Netherlands’ agriculture minister Sicco Mansholt piloted large-scale mechanised farming. Mansholt wanted to secure the country’s food supply by increasing production. Heavy machinery, chemical fertilisers, and new research and technology were part of a modernising mission that Mansholt later evangelised across the continent as the first European commissioner for agriculture through the common agricultural policy. He sought to build a postwar Europe of plenty while lifting small farmers out of poverty and integrating Europe’s economies.Public opinion turned against Europe’s state-sponsored excesses, in favour of efficiency-driven American capitalism. Wageningen was suffering an existential crisis. “There was a questioning (sic) of – should we take responsibility, shouldn’t the market do things?” said Fresco, who at the time was a rising star at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and would have been aware of the waste mountains and the first international conversations about sustainability. Wageningen’s establishment turned to the giants of industry to keep the university afloat.Walking around Wageningen with Fresco, I am struck at how the town has compartmentalised the angst and suffering of the war in a small museum in its cobbled old quarter. The futuristic Wageningen next door is unsentimental and solution-focused. Its glossy, modernist buildings architecturally distance the lingering emotion of Europe’s history, and invite in only reason and logic. Big money propels Wageningen’s new swagger. Sleek corporate buildings of companies such as Unilever and Dutch dairy giant FrieslandCampina blend seamlessly into the campus architecture and the old university town has rebranded as “Food Valley” – a shiny agri-tech mecca with one big goal: shaping the future of food.This mission-driven Wageningen is providing dazzling solutions to humanity’s impending food supply problem. As an example, one of the university’s star scientists Leo Marcellis is pioneering new vertical farming techniques as a possible solution to producing more food without using more land. Marcellis grows plants in tiered shelves inside highly monitored labs. The potential of this innovation is immense, he says, conjuring skyscrapers of herbs and abandoned buildings stacked with vegetable farms. But there is a small-print environmental cost attached, Marcellis admits. His vertical farms require huge inputs of artificial light, and are partially funded by Phillips, the lightbulb manufacturer. Marcellis’ land-saving vertical farms, it emerges, will require quite a lot of lightbulbs.The close relationship between Wageningen scientists and industry makes many people uncomfortable. Dutch investigative journalist Vincent Harmsen from One World magazine recently went to court asking Wageningen to release information about scientists’ communications with Syngenta, Monsanto and Bayer, large agrochemical firms. The university denied his freedom of information request, and a court upheld the university’s right to do so, on the grounds that Wageningen University’s funding is partially private. But without understanding the relationships between scientists and companies, Harmsen argues, it is impossible to discern scientific fact from company-sponsored fiction.This proximity between science and industry goes all the way to the top of the Wageningen pyramid. Fresco is a paid non-executive director of the multinational Syngenta. She previously held positions at Unilever and Dutch financial firm Rabobank. She argues that collaboration between private companies and science is necessary, and can be positive. Her role at Syngenta, she says, involves advising the company about sustainability. “Syngenta is not influencing Wageningen. It is contracting me, who tries to bring some good ideas to Syngenta. We work with all kinds of industry because we fundamentally believe that these big companies have such an influence in the world that they need to be helped to formulate sustainable products and ideas.”Meanwhile, on an abandoned apple orchard in Wageningen, a handful of students are planting a forest.In it, they will grow pumpkins, walnuts and berries. The aim is to demonstrate that small-scale farming is viable and more environmentally friendly than industrial mega-farms. “Louise Fresco still thinks quite a lot in terms of ‘we have to feed the world’,” says Louise Vercruysse, one of the students planting the farm. “I’m not really into that. You have to first look at why the world can’t feed itself.”The young Wageningeners believe that profit-seeking industrial farming has driven the planet to the edge of crisis. The Netherlands’ fantastical food production messaging has hidden modern agriculture’s assault on the environment for years, says Vercryusse. Dutch bees and butterflies are vanishing at astonishing speed, while Dutch children are suffering from pollution-induced asthma at rates higher than any country on the continent. Nitrogen levels, caused in part by hyperproductive Dutch dairy farms, when mapped from space resemble a wound over the country. To combat emissions, in 2019 Dutch courts delayed 18,000 construction projects and cut the national speed limit.The activist students say Wageningen’s curriculum is still prioritising industry over the environment. To introduce new ideas to her peers, student Eva van Dijk, organises lunchtime lectures by Wouter van Eck and champions forest farming – where food is foraged or cultivated in ecologically erse forest ecosystems.Far from feeding the world – Van Eck tells the students, European colonisers destroyed the world’s indigenous food production systems. Eighteenth-century Europeans did not recognise the indigenous plants of the Americas, seeing instead only timber forests that needed felling. Now, he says, Europe is trying to export its broken agriculture system to solve a hunger crisis it created.Van Eck argues that the calculations used to bump the Netherlands up in the export rankings are misleading. They are based on the monetary value of exports rather than the quantity or nutritional value of the produce. The Dutch dairy industry, for example, buys huge amounts of fodder from Brazil, using up farmland that could be used to grow food for Brazil’s native population. To Van Eck, the idea that the Netherlands’ surpluses feed the world, is a hollow and dangerous lie. “The Netherlands is a black hole for food production,” he says. “Wageningen is not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.”Van Eck gets a rockstar reception from the auditorium full of students attending the lecture. A number of them surround him at the end to examine the baskets of forest-grown fruit and herbs he has brought along and ask him if they can organise internships at his forest farm.Activist students at Wageningen organise underground seed exchanges, encouraging farmers to bypass the highly regulated, industry-dominated seed market. Some organise events where they throw seed “bombs” into parks and fields to break the monotony of the Netherlands’ controlled green spaces.The students believe the rational response to ecological crisis is to produce and consume less, even if it causes an economic backslide. This idea is catching fire around the world. Economists like Giorgos Kallis who champion “degrowth”, say western economies have achieved an optimal state, and should stop chasing GDP-driven yearly growth and focus instead on limiting environmental damage. At last year’s UN Climate Action Summit in New York, Greta Thunberg rebuked world leaders for continuing to pursue economic rather than ecological goals. “You are failing us,” she said.The young Wageningeners are aware that they will live through an era of environmental calamity that will shape their entire lives. Their university years lack outward signs of frivolous indulgence and instead are characterised by astounding personal choices. At Droevendaal, an ecological complex near the university, Van Dijk tells me the students bulk order organic produce like cereal and rice and share it between houses to keep costs low. Their primary mode of transport is cycling. They spend their spare time cultivating vegetable patches in their gardens and eat omelettes made from fresh eggs from chickens roaming the area. Solar panels provide their energy. Unwanted clothes, books and scrap are traded in a shed called the “Giveawayshop” to minimise waste.The students’ ideas, though, are untested. Van Eck admits in his lecture that his technique of farming is still a pilot project, and that he is not advocating for all farmers to turn their fields into forests. Scientists have raised questions about other alternative farming methods in the past. Many argue, for example, that some organic fertilisers and pesticides, though natural, can be harmful to the environment. Plus, lower yields on organic farms could mean having to use more land – which could lead to further deforestation.Disrupting food supply chains runs huge socio-economic risks, threatening millions of livelihoods around the world. In February, thousands of farmers in angry tractor convoys protested at The Hague, where parliament sits, fearing that debates about the environmental impact of Dutch agriculture could wipe out their businesses.On the apple orchard, the students agree that their experiments are only a starting point for the questions facing humanity. “I am still figuring out what I think the ideal path is,” said one, as I was leaving. “One thing is clear. The system we have now is not going to feed the planet without completely destroying the Earth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa7c328c58d3e206dc391412d675c597b6a1a04b/0_366_5490_3294/master/5490.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfa972ceecf6ef3c81ef1dea6f0bf80d","title":"coronavirus live updates italy germany pandemic europe uk us australia india update latest news","story":"California declares state of emergency Italian doctors say German man may have been first European with virus and Scotland registers three more cases Iranian authorities are to begin manning checkpoints to limit travel between major cities due to the coronavirus in a country which is now one of the centres of the outbreak.The country has also moved to close schools and universities until the end of the Iranian calendar year on 20 March because of coronavirus.Health minister Saeed Namaki made the announcement Thursday at a televised news conference.Starbucks has said it will only use disposable cups at its North American outlets.The company also said in a statement that it was “pausing the use of personal cups and ‘for here’ ware” in its stores.

According to the German doctors, “a 33-year-old otherwise healthy German businessman (Patient 1) became ill with a sore throat, chills, and myalgias on 24 January 2020. The following day, a fever of 39.1°C (102.4°F) developed, along with a productive cough. By the evening of the next day, he started feeling better and went back to work on 27 January.”On 20 and 21 January, before the onset of symptoms, the man had attended a series of meetings with a Chinese business partner at his company near Munich. The business partner, a Shanghai resident, had visited Germany between 19 and 22 January. “During her stay, she had been well with no signs or symptoms of infection but had become ill on her flight back to China, where she tested positive for 2019-nCoV on 26 January,” write the doctors.The woman had immediately informed the company about her illness. Contact tracing was started and the 33-year-old German man was sent to the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine in Munich for further assessment.On 28 January, three additional employees at the company tested positive for 2019-nCoV and so far, none of the four confirmed patients show signs of severe clinical illness.“This case of 2019-nCoV infection was diagnosed in Germany and transmitted outside Asia,” write the experts. “However, it is notable that the infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of the index patient, in whom the illness was brief and nonspecific.”People who are elderly or have pre-existing conditions could be advised to stay away from crowds as the outbreak progresses, the chief medical officer Chris Whitty has told MPs.He added that parliament was no more risky than any other environment, following reports the Palace of Westminster could be closed down as a result of the outbreak.The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is encouraging countries who want to know how much of their population is sick with the virus to start testing people with symptoms.Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme technical lead, made the comments in a briefing earlier.The Federation of German industries, the BDI, has warned this morning that the effects of the coronavirus on businesses is likely to send Europe’s biggest economy into recession. Germany’s Robert Koch Institute said that by Wednesday afternoon there were 262 confirmed cases in Germany, with all but one of the country’s 16 states affected.The BDI said economic growth was likely to “fall prey” to the coronavirus. “Economic growth threatens to come to a halt,” the federation said in its first quarter report for 2020.It added that if the coronavirus was not brought under control in countries affected by it, by the second economic quarter it expected a much bigger impact. Germany’s economic growth had already been slower than expected before the virus hit, due largely to the slowdown in China.While we reported earlier that North Korea’s leader has sent a letter to the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, offering his condolences for South Korean victims of the coronavirus, observers have expressed fears that the north could be suppressing information about infections.Given that countries with advanced health services are struggling to contain the outbreak, a significant number of infections in North Korea would place intolerable strain on its weak medical infrastructure.“Unfortunately, the international community has no idea if the coronavirus is spreading inside North Korea,” said a recent report by Jessica Lee, an East Asia expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a thinktank in Washington.“The fact that we know nothing about the level of infection or deaths within North Korea is extremely problematic and, left unchanged, could have serious public health implications.”While continuing to declare itself virus-free, North Korea has banned foreign tourists, placed people who have traveled abroad in quarantine and closed its 900-mile border with China - a move that overseas monitors with contacts inside the country say has caused shortages of food, cooking oil and gasoline.As the number of cases south of the border iding the Korean peninsula continues to grow, pressure is mounting on the North to allow international experts to assess the situation there.The UN special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, Tomas Ojea Quintana, has urged North Korea to “allow full and unimpeded access to medical experts and humanitarian actors, and relax restrictions on access to information. Further isolation of the country is not the answer”.In addition, the US state department has said it would “support and encourage” international efforts to help North Korea fight the disease, despite stringent sanctions imposed on the country over its nuclear weapons programme.A 74-year-old woman in western Switzerland has died after contracting the coronavirus, the country’s first death from the rapidly spreading disease, Reuters reports.The woman had been hospitalised at Lausanne’s University hospital in the canton of Vaud since Tuesday, police said. She was a high-risk patient suffering from chronic disease, authorities added.England’s Six Nations game against Italy on 14 March in Rome has been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Press Associatino news agency has reported.Tournament organisers faced the option of playing the game behind closed doors at the Stadio Olimpico or delaying it until later in the year and have chosen the latter option.Official confirmation of the decision is expected from Six Nations later today.The UK response to coronavirus was already moving into its second “delay” phase, rather than seeking to simply “contain” the disease, Prof Whitty told British MPs.“We have moved from a situation where we are mainly in contain, with some delay built in, to we are now mainly delay,” said Britain’s chief medical officer, although elements of the contain process would remain in place.British health authorities “may have had a communications fumble” when they announced on Wednesday that they would not be providing daily updates on new coronavirus cases, the UK government’s chief medical officer has told MPs.They are intending in the medium term to provide more detailed updates with what Chris Whitty described as “a proper dashboard” but they would be having a delay of 24 hours to make sure details were correct.Three more cases of Covid-19 have been detected in Scotland among people who have had contact with the previous patients, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to six. Catherine Calderwood, Scotland’s chief medical officer, said the new cases were found in the Forth Valley, Greater Glasgow \u0026amp Clyde and Grampian NHS areas, and were all linked to the three previous cases. “With all these cases, our thoughts are with those diagnosed and their families. Scotland is well equipped to deal with this kind of infection and we are doing everything we can to contain the virus at this stage and minimise the risk to the public,” she said.“Clinicians are now conducting contact tracing, the process of gathering details of the places those who have tested positive visited and the people they have been in contact with.”Calderwood has echoed warnings from elsewhere in the UK that there is likely to be a significant surge in coronavirus cases, peaking in two to three months time. Following Scotland’s first case at the weekend, two further cases were announced yesterday, after more than 850 negative tests for the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eae899b66ca5a4544c8c7fc3549f159248d9f84f/0_360_5906_3544/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=068ca47cd0d0d67fa4362bb8920cc554","title":"everest by sohei nishino","story":"Photo-collage by Japanese artist is made from hundreds of prints from foothills to summit"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4193182.1583389596!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus cluster of cases in west brings state total to six","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr John Cuddihy,  Health Protection Surveillance Centre director, Department of Health chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and deputy chief medical offier Dr Ronan Glynn during a media update on Covid-19 at the Department of Health, Miesian Plaza, Baggot Street, Dublin. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsHealth Service Executive (HSE)\u0026nbspchief executive Paul Reid has warned of a “potentially unprecedented” situation for the health service, as Ireland’s first cluster of coronavirus cases was confirmed last night.Two males and two females in the west of the country tested positive for the virus on Wednesday evening, bringing to six the number of confirmed cases of the virus in the Republic.Northern Ireland also reported two new cases on Wednesday, one of them a Queen’s University Belfast student, bringing its total to three.The group of four new cases reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is understood to involve members of the same family recently returned from northern Italy. They are being cared for in a hospital in the west.The process of tracing people who came into contact with them has already begun, but is likely to be more complex than it was with the inidual cases previously reported.All of the cases reported in the Republic are in travellers returning from Italy.Separately, Mr Reid has warned the country is facing a potentially unprecedented health situation arising from the Covid-19 outbreak.In a bulletin on Wednesday evening, he said the health service, although still in a containment phase, was planning for all eventualities.“From what we are learning, however, as we see how the virus spreads in countries across Europe and in the UK, we are facing a potentially unprecedented situation in this country and across all of our health services.“So we must continue to be vigilant and practise good infection prevention and control measures, to protect ourselves, our patients and our colleagues.”Northern IrelandNeither of the two new cases in the North involved travel through the Republic.The North’s minister for health Robin Swann said the two cases were not connected.“One inidual travelled from northern Italy. The other had recent contact with a person elsewhere in the UK who had subsequently tested positive for Covid-19,” he said.Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, said there were “no implications” for the Republic.In the North, Antrim Area Hospital has set up a drive-through testing service for the virus.With new cases outside China now far outnumbering those in that country, the number of cases in Italy passed the 3,000 mark, with 107 deaths. Schools and universities have been ordered to close and Serie A teams will play games in empty stadiums to try to slow the spread of the disease.In Ireland, no public events are facing restrictions arising from the coronavirus outbreak, Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer with the Department of Health, said.Guidelines on the holding of mass gatherings are currently being finalised with a view to restricting the spread of the virus. The outbreak has already forced the postponement of the Ireland-Italy rugby match due to take place this weekend.However, Dr Holohan said “at the moment, there are no implications for any event, large or small, in this country”.Confusion and stereotypes“As things stand, on the basis of our assessment, we see no implication for the St Patrick’s Day parade, and we don’t see that changing,” he said at the daily briefing from NPHET on Wednesday.He warned against “unilateral actions” by “well-intentioned” people in communities that run the risk of creating confusion or reinforcing stereotypes.While not referring to specific incidents – a Co Meath school closed on Wednesday due to fears over the virus – Dr Holohan said it was important that whatever happened in local communities was “informed by clear advice”.He said he understood why people might be concerned but there was information and guidance available on what to do from the HSE which could assuage concerns.Again defending NPHET’s stance on not naming the school where the first confirmed case is a student, he said the confidentiality of people had to be protected and there was no public interest in “going further”.The HSE warned sick people not to attend religious services and said churches should plan for the possible suspension of activities if clergy fall ill with coronavirus.The shaking of hands at services should be suspended, holy water fonts should not be used and priests have been advised to “nod” or “smile” instead of exchanging the sign of peace, it has advised.The UK on Wednesday saw its biggest day-on-day increase in coronavirus cases, with 85 people now confirmed to have the virus. Three of the 29 new cases in England were passed on in the UK, raising fears that community transmission may be taking hold.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4192842.1583356242!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus four cases confirmed in family from west of ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn Emergency Department Nurse during a demonstration of the Coronavirus pod and COVID-19 virus testing procedures set-up beside the Emergency Department of Antrim Area Hospital, Co Antrim in Northern Ireland. Photograph: Michael CooperPA WireIreland’s first cluster of coronavirus cases has been confirmed, after a family of four tested positive for the disease on Wednesday evening.The group comprises two males and two females, and are in the west of the country. The four people are being cared for in a hospital in the west.The latest positive tests from the National Virus Reference Laboratory bring to six the number of confirmed cases of the virus in the Republic, and nine on the island of Ireland.As with the two previous cases in the Republic, the latest cases are linked to recent travel from northern Italy.Two new cases of coronavirus (Covid-19) in Northern Ireland were confirmed earlier on Wednesday. Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “Tonight we can confirm there are now six cases of COVID-19 in Ireland. Contact tracing is underway for these four new cases.” Dr Ronan Glynn, Deputy Chief Medical Officer said: “There is still no evidence of widespread or sustained community transmission in Ireland, as seen in some other EU countries. “While we now have six confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ireland, we continue our containment efforts, central to which is that the public know what to do in the event they have symptoms.” The development has major implications for the current containment strategy being followed by public health officials. The tracing of contacts of all four confirmed cases is likely to begin immediately, but is likely to pose a far greater challenges than in the two inidual cases reported in the Republic up to now.Separately, Health Service Executive chief executive Paul Reid has warned that the country is facing a potentially unprecedented health situation arising from the Covid-19 outbreak.In a bulletin on Wednesday evening, Paul Reid said the health service, although still in a containment phase , was planning for all eventualities.“From what we are learning, however, as we see how the virus spreads in countries across Europe and in the UK, we are facing a potentially unprecedented situation in this country and across all of our health services. “So we must continue to be vigilant and practise good infection prevention and control measures, to protect ourselves, our patients, and our colleagues.”College students One of two new cases in Northern Ireland is a student from Queen’s University, Belfast who recently returned from northern Italy and who is believed to have been in contact with other students from the college.After the North’s Minister of Health Robin Swann confirmed the two new cases, bringing the number in Northern Ireland to three, Queen’s University said it was working with the North’s Public Health Agency (PHA) to contain the virus.Mr Swann said the two cases were not connected.“One inidual travelled from Northern Italy. The other had recent contact with a person elsewhere in the UK who had subsequently tested positive for Covid-19,” he said.“Both patients are adults and are receiving appropriate care. Public Health Agency personnel are working rapidly to identify contacts they may have had, with the aim of preventing further spread,” he added .“I would stress that Northern Ireland remains in containment phase,” said Mr Swann. “As I have said from the beginning it was a matter of when not if we received positive cases here in Northern Ireland.”Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said neither patient had travelled through the Republic. “There are no implications for the Republic of Ireland,” he said.Queen’s confirmed the coronavirus case “within the university”.In a statement, it said: “The university is working with the Public Health Agency to ensure that anyone who has been in contact with the infected inidual is identified and supported to receive medical attention if required, and to take all appropriate steps to contain any further spread of the virus and to protect the welfare of all within the university community and the wider public.“The university remains open and is operating as normal. The university will continue to closely monitor the situation,” it added.Queen’s said it has provided online guidance for staff and students and encouraged them to follow the latest official guidance from the PHA. “The university’s major incident team has been convened and is putting in place the appropriate contingency measures which will be communicated to staff and students when appropriate,” it added.While the Northern Ireland health authorities earlier said they were planning to send Covid-19 patients to England if they required further clinical treatment, Dr McBride said not all such patients would require such care.“We have a regional infectious disease unit here in Northern Ireland and indeed we have other facilities which are able to provide appropriate treatment and care,” he added.“We know that for the vast majority of people it will be a mild to moderate illness and they will get appropriate care based on where the appropriate place is to treat the inidual. Not all cases are being transferred to high-consequence infectious disease units because it is not clinically necessary.”He added that there was no connection between either of these two latest cases and the Northern Ireland woman who tested positive for coronavirus last week. Dr Gerry Waldron of the PHA said the authorities were now working to trace all those the patients were in contact with. He said they were following an “established method of contact tracing” which was applied in the initial Northern Ireland case and was well under way in relation to the latest cases. Those who were in contact with the patients would be given information and advice on what action they needed to take, added Dr Waldron.The first confirmed case in Northern Ireland, revealed last weekend, had travelled from Italy through Dublin Airport to Belfast before testing positive.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4192955.1583356595!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus how are other countries coping","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVisitors queue outside the  Louvre museum in Paris after staff ended coronavirus walkout following  two days of closure.  Photograph: Philippe Lopez AFPThe Republic’s second confirmed case of coronavirus, announced on Tuesday night, has focused minds on the measures that might have to be taken to limit the spread of the disease here. The refusal of public health officials to identify the school affected by the first case has also sparked debate over the levels of transparency that should apply during an epidemic.While Ireland is wrestling with the challenges of dealing with its few cases, many other countries are dealing with large-scale outbreaks and person-to-person transmission in their communities, as opposed to imported cases. So how are other countries coping with this challenge? What can Ireland learn from their experience? A selection of  correspondents around the world report:France: The French public are kept abreast of developments in the coronavirus epidemic by a government website and a toll-free telephone number. An hourly radio announcement from the ministry of health tells inhabitants to wash their hands often, avoid shaking hands or kissing cheeks and cough or sneeze into their elbow or a disposable tissue. If they believe they have been contaminated, the French are advised to stay at home and wear a surgical mask when in the presence of other people. If people need medical care, they are told not to go their doctor’s office, or hospital but to call the ambulance.The director general of health Jérôme Salomon holds a daily briefing. There are no restrictions on press coverage. Figures and locations of coronavirus cases are updated daily on the government website. As of Tuesday afternoon, 212 cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed. There are three principal clusters. In these areas, classified as epidemic level 2, all schools have closed, open air markets, public meetings, including church services, rallies for the March 15th-22nd municipal elections, cinemas, swimming pools, sports clubs, employment agencies have been shut down for at least 14 days. Pensioners are not allowed to leave nursing homes. People who have been in direct contact with a contaminated person are asked to stay at home.Each infected person is asked to supply a list of people they have been in contact with in recent days. There was widespread criticism when the February 26th Lyon-Turin football match was allowed to go ahead in Lyon, with the presence of 3,000 Italian supporters, despite the fact that northern Italy was a contaminated zone. Passengers are allowed to board trains leaving contaminated zones without restriction. On Wednesday the Louvre in Paris opened again, having been closed since Sunday, after employees worried about catching Covid-19 agreed to return to work.Belgium In Belgium, where coronavirus cases have risen to 23, health authorities have a website for advice and live updates.When new cases are announced, the authorities state the region and often the hospital where the patient is being treated. (Local press sometimes report additional details like age and specific location.) Doctors trace what contacts the patient had and test them “if necessary”.People who fear they might be infected are advised to phone their doctor, and to wash their hands frequently. If someone is experiencing symptoms after travelling to an affected region, they are told to isolate themselves, contact their doctor, and not to visit the emergency room. Hospitals in the city of Liège are installing temporary buildings to keep coronavirus cases separate from other patients.There have been two cases connected to European Union institutions. As with infections in company workplaces, spokespeople for the organisations have confirmed details to media.In cases connected to schools, the name of the school has been released to media by school management or local government. The schools remained open, close contacts were tested, and classmates were told to monitor their temperatures.Authorities have told staff and students were told they must continue to attend school if they do not have symptoms, and that any healthy students kept at home would be “unlawfully absent”.“If you close down a school, you cause a chain reaction. Parents cannot go to work, there is an economic impact,” public health spokesman Jan Eyckmans told local press.Since the weekend Belgium has been in “phase 2” of its emergency plan, which means a focus on containing the spread of the virus (phase 1 is keeping it out of the country). Schools, cinemas and public events would only be closed down if the situation moved to “phase 3”, in which it is no longer possible to keep track of the spread of the virus and focus shifts to saving lives.ChinaChinese officials seriously downplayed the extent of the outbreak for several weeks but around January 20th the official policy suddenly shifted to declaring “all-out war”. Within a week at least 760 million people were put under some form of quarantine, schools and businesses were shuttered, transport systems halted and public gatherings banned.Since then there have been daily briefings, information is posted online detailing the number of new infections, suspected cases, fatalities and recoveries. The online data gives regional breakdowns and lists the addresses of housing compounds, hotels etc where cases have been found.There are designated hospitals and temporary centres set up for the infected. If people think they might have contracted the virus they are advised to call a hotline and medics in hazmat suits come to their homes. In the worst-affected areas, these centres have been overwhelmed and are often unable to cope .Given that some people with symptoms are afraid to go to the designated hospitals, local officials go door to door each day in some cities checking everyone’s temperature. Chemists are closed in some areas to stop people with symptoms self-medicating instead of reporting. Schools and colleges are still closed indefinitely across the country. With the recent slowdown in infections in China, businesses in many regions are being encouraged to reopen, but most need to obtain written permission. Moreover, many workers are still stuck in their hometowns as the lockdowns came during lunar new year. An estimated 70 per cent of businesses remain closed.Most cities are still insisting on a 14-day self-isolation period for anyone arriving from out of town. Hubei and other seriously affected areas are still sealed off.With regard to media coverage and online discussions , the domestic press, the internet and social media platforms are rigidly controlled by censors and content critical of the government or that strays far from the official narrative is quickly scrubbed.ItalyEurope’s worst-hit country, Italy closed all schools and universities and prepared other emergency measures on Wednesday to try to slow the spread. Twenty-eight people have died in recent days bringing the total number of dead to 107 and the number of cases at 3,089. UKIn the UK the government published an action plan on Tuesday hoping to contain the spread, as cases jumped to 87. The plan includes increased publicity about good hygiene and ill workers staying at home. It includes population distancing strategies such as school closures, encouraging homeworking, and reducing the number of large-scale gatherings. New powers were introduced in England to allow people to be quarantined BrazilBrazil’s federal health ministry and state governments are issuing updates with officials giving regular briefings to media and posting bulletins and advice online. The focus is on the number of confirmed and suspected cases in the country and their location. Authorities are also providing information on prevention and advice on travel. It has also set up a service to combat fake news .People who suspect they might have contracted Covid-19 are obliged to inform authorities within 24 hours. Brazil so far has only two cases confirmed, both imported by travellers returning from Italy. The names of the two people have not been ulged but authorities have identified the São Paulo hospital handling treatment. Brazil’s congress last month passed a new law allowing the health ministry to submit people with suspected cases to compulsory testing, order compulsory quarantine and administer vaccines and other medical treatments. It also allows for restrictions on people entering and leaving the country. HungaryHungary on Wednesday confirmed its first two cases of the new coronavirus, both Iranian students in the country.Last week, 11 secondary school students, two teachers and two drivers who had returned from a trip to northern Italy were placed in quarantine for a fortnight in a hospital in Budapest. Several other Hungarians who have returned from affected areas and cruise ships are also in quarantine.Hungarian officials say anyone with coronavirus symptoms or who has returned from badly affected areas should call rather than visit their doctor. If possible infection is suspected, they will be transferred by ambulance to a clinic for testing.The public has been urged to keep calm after reports last week of panic buying, and hundreds of thousands of facemasks are being made available. Gyorgy Bakondi, chief security adviser to Hungary’s anti-immigration prime minister Viktor Orban, announced on Sunday that for an indefinite period asylum seekers would not be admitted to the controversial “transit zone” on the Hungary-Serbia border.He claimed there was “a link” between migration and the coronavirus, and said many of the migrants arriving at Hungary’s southern frontier were from or had travelled through Iran, a Covid-19 hotspot.IndiaTwenty-eight people have tested positive in India to the coronavirus, with a sharp rise in cases on Wednesday after 15 Italian tourists and their driver tested positive, while at least six other locals contracted the virus from a person returning from Italy. The tourists are in quarantine in Delhi. Another Italian national is presently under observation in the tourist city of Jaipur in western Rajasthan state. According to the government’s Press Information Bureau (PIB) more than 500,000 passengers had been screened at several of the country’s airports.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe EU and UK could agree a “device” to extend the transition period if talks fail to secure a trade deal by the July 1st deadline, a former European Commission secretary-general has said.David O’Sullivan, an Irish former EU director-general in charge of trade who brokered the bloc’s trade with South Korea, said the UK government could drop its objection to the extension of the transition period from the end of the year if it could be sold politically at home. This could then “buy” both sides “more time to continue the discussions” to resolve issues where agreement has not agreed and avoid another potential “cliff-edge” no-deal scenario on December 31st, Mr O’Sullivan told The .British prime minister Boris Johnson has threatened to walk away from Brexit trade talks if negotiations have failed to make progress by June and to focus instead on preparations for the UK’s hard exit from EU economic rules on World Trade Organization terms at the end of the year. Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, both the EU and UK must agree to extend the transition period by July 1st, though the UK government has legislated to prevent this scenario happening.Mr O’Sullivan said that he did not think it possible to agree a comprehensive free trade agreement in the nine-month period available and said that an extension of the transition period could be agreed, “which would not be called an extension”.“As a former negotiator I could imagine such a device being possible if both sides felt it worked for them,” he said.“Obviously it would require the UK to feel they could sell this as not being an extension of the transition phase, but I could imagine that it would have benefits for both sides potentially if it is not possible to solve everything or even to solve most things by the end of the year.”The retired Irish civil servant said he was most worried the EU-UK trade talks, which began on Monday, were not starting from “a position of mutual trust and confidence” in the wake of reports saying that the UK were trying to “get around” the ratified Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. “It is very unhelpful. As Irish people, of course we feel particularly aggrieved by that kind of language,” he said.“Stepping back from the emotions of our nationality, I think the rest of the EU will look at this and say, ‘but wait a minute we have a legal document, legally binding by both sides, ratified and suddenly we are told one side is actively considering how to wriggle out of it.’”‘Unprecedented’Mr O’Sullivan, whose last official posting was as EU ambassador to the US from 2014-2019, described the EU-UK trade talks as “unprecedented” in that the two sides were moving from a position of total free trade to less free trade.The negotiations were “sort of free trade in reverse” as the discussions were uniquely aimed at finding agreement on the degree of ergence rather than convergence, said Mr O’Sullivan. “Typically, in a situation of free trade negotiations, you are talking about two parties who are relatively far apart or have distance between them and you are trying to narrow that distance and you are trying to converge,” he said. “Here we have perfect convergence which we are trying to turn into imperfect ergence.” Mr O’Sullivan will be speaking at an event hosted by the Institute of International and European Affairs in Dublin and Trinity College’s “Hist” debating society on Wednesday alongside former commission president Romano Prodi, and former European Council president and Belgian prime minister Herman Van Rompuy.

None of the options facing Martin are attractive. He has ruled out entering government with Sinn Féin and is now reliant on Fine Gael to make him taoiseach.

Some in his parliamentary party believe Martin has boxed himself in by shutting down the Sinn Féin option so quickly – although there’s little desire to enter government with that party – and has driven some voters further into the arms of Mary Lou McDonald by repeatedly attacking her, allowing McDonald further her claim to outsider status. “They used to say Maggie Thatcher was the best recruiter for the IRA,” one TD said. “Micheál is the best recruiter for the Shinners.”The longer the process of government formation continues, the greater the chance that disquiet in Fianna Fáil will bubble to the surface. But against Fianna Fáil’s willingness to talk, Leo Varadkar still insists he wants to go into Opposition. Genuine desireThose close to the Taoiseach insist this is Varadkar’s genuine desire and say he is not merely posturing before doing a deal with Martin. Some Green Party figures left talks with Fine Gael in recent days believing Opposition is the latter party’s ultimate goal. However, the difficulty of actually achieving that goal is evident to all.Having said he would work with Fianna Fáil as a last resort to avoid a second election, the question is how far the Taoiseach is willing to go to get to the Opposition benches. Does he, against a background of the coronavirus outbreak and Brexit threats, string Martin along for months? Fianna Fáil sources say there is a “misguided impression” in Fine Gael that Fianna Fáil will “crack” and talk to Sinn Féin. This, those at the top of Fianna Fáil insist, will not happen, but many TDs are deeply hostile to coalition with Fine Gael too.Some chat around Leinster House – including at the highest levels in Fine Gael – has suggested President Michael D Higgins could even refuse a request from Mr Varadkar to dissolve the Dáil if negotiations hit an impasse. It has been argued that that event could then force parties to reach agreement where they had previously failed to do so. However, given that he is fiercely protective of the independence of the presidency, the President may not want to be used as a political tool, and Mr Higgins, if there is no government formed by May, may actually allow for a dissolution of the Dáil and another election.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4193122.1583400176!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in is the richest political party in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerry Adams, Michelle O’Neill and Mary Lou McDonald at a Sinn Féin conference in 2017. File photograph: Nick BradshawSinn Féin is the richest political party on the island of Ireland, with about 200 staff and, according to its director of finance, Des Mackin, an extensive network of more than 50 properties.Sinn Féin has experienced a surge in membership applications since the general election was called in January, and will recruit more staff on the basis of its increased representation in Leinster House following the election, Mr Mackin has told The .Besides the four headquarter buildings in Dublin and Belfast declared in the party’s annual accounts, local branches of Sinn Féin own a further 50 or so properties that are used as constituency offices, he said.No other party on the island has anything approaching a property portfolio of this size, and no other political party is anything approaching as cash-rich as Sinn Féin.Mr Mackin is currently in the process of realising approximately €4 million that was left to the party by Mr Hampton, an unmarried English man who died in a public nursing home in Wales in 2018.The executors of the 1997 will in which Mr Hampton left his estate to the party were Mr Mackin and late veteran republican Joe Cahill, who were Sinn Féin’s joint national treasurers at the time.Sale of propertyMoney held in UK accounts has already been given to the party as part of the bequest, while property in Britain and Ireland that formed part of the estate is currently being sold, and approximately €1 million is in the process of being released from a bank account in Singapore.“That transfer should be done by the end of the month,” Mr Mackin said. “The whole thing should be done by the end of the year.”Political funding rules mean the money cannot be spent in the Republic, but the huge bequest is a massive boost to Sinn Féin’s overall financial position.Mr Mackin said that since the election was called by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in January, the party had received an additional 4,200 membership applications, as well as about 500 applications to join its youth wing.Mr Mackin said that “pound for pound”, Sinn Féin and its elected representatives are able to employ more staff for the money they get from Dublin, London and Brussels than rival political parties because the party’s “activist ethos” means people are prepared to work for less.Resisting extraditionMr Mackin was jailed for IRA membership in the early 1970s and successfully resisted extradition from the US to Northern Ireland in the 1980s to face charges arising from a shooting incident involving undercover British soldiers and the IRA.He told The  that he did not necessarily disagree with the view of the Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, that Sinn Féin was run by unelected officials and not its political representatives.“We don’t want a parliamentary party running the organisation,” he said. “We want to stay a party of activists. It’s a totally different model. There’s nothing mysterious about it.”The former party leader, Gerry Adams, is heading up a new unit within the party to ensure it keeps its focus on its main objective of achieving a united Ireland, Mr Mackin said.“Everything should be thought of in terms of a united Ireland. It is important to ensure and promote the united Ireland vision, to make sure it goes right through and that all our policies are thought of in those terms,” he said.Three former Sinn Féin politicians who spoke separately to The  said it was their experience that paid party staff reporting to headquarters had sought to direct their work as elected representatives when they were in Sinn Féin.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4193663.1583392797!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus new cases rise in china after three days of decline","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChinese sales clerks wear protective masks in Beijing. Photograph: Kevin FrayerGetty ImagesMainland China reported a rise in new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Thursday, reversing three straight days of declines, because of a spike in new infections in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak.Mainland China had 139 new confirmed cases as of Wednesday, the National Health Commission (NHC) said, bringing the total accumulated number of cases to 80,409. Authorities reported 119 new cases the previous day and 125 the day before that.The increase was driven by more cases in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, where the virus is believed to have emerged in a market late last year.Wuhan’s new infections climbed to 131 from 114 a day earlier. There was no immediate elaboration and health officials were due to hold a briefing later in the day.After what some critics said was an initially hesitant response to the new virus, China imposed sweeping restrictions to try to stop it, including transport suspensions, lockdowns of cities and extending a Lunar New Year holiday across the country.World Health Organization (WHO) officials have said other countries have much to learn from the way China has handled the outbreak and vice-foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu said many countries had asked for help and China was responding.The number of new confirmed cases in Hubei, excluding Wuhan, has remained in single digits for seven consecutive days, with three new infections recorded on Wednesday.In the rest of mainland China, outside Hubei, there were only five new confirmed cases, the health commission said.The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China had reached 3,012 as of the end of Wednesday, up by 31 from the previous day. Hubei accounted for all of the new deaths. In Wuhan, 23 people died.With the downward trend in new cases, Chinese authorities have turned their attention to stopping the virus being brought in from new coronavirus hot spots abroad.Worrying spreadsThe number of new infections overseas now exceeds the tally of new cases in China, with Italy, South Korea and Iran, in particular, seeing worrying spreads of the virus.Authorities have asked overseas Chinese hoping to return home to reconsider their travel plans, while cities across the country have set up quarantine rules for those entering from high-risk places.An infected person is known to have arrived in China from Iran, one of the new hot spots for the virus, last week.The cities of Shanghai and Guangdong have ordered people who have been in countries with severe outbreaks within the previous two weeks to stay in quarantine for 14 days.The city of Chengdu in central Sichuan province said it was also ordering quarantine for such people.The NHC has said authorities were transitioning from “overall containment to targeted containment” measures, with a focus on containment within communities, and medical treatment.Mr Ma told a briefing China would make donations to South Korea, Iraq, Cambodia and Sri Lanka, on top of what it has already given to Pakistan, Japan and Iran.China was also considering responding to WHO call for donations, he said.“Many of the countries which have requested for our help had actually helped us previously, so when we help these countries, it is to help them fight the virus, and also to repay their kindness,” Mr Ma said. Border controlsMeanwhile, Australia on Thursday banned the arrival of foreigners from South Korea, tightening its border controls in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus as it recorded its second death from the illness.Prime minister Scott Morrison also extended existing bans on foreigners arriving from mainland China and Iran and said there would be tougher screening processes for people arriving from Italy.“It affords the best protection and enables us to slow down the rate of transmission,” Mr Morrison told reporters in Canberra, as health officials said modelling suggests the worst case scenario is for the virus to spread to millions of people within weeks.Australia was one of the first countries to take a hardline approach to tackling the coronavirus outbreak, imposing border controls on visitors from the epidemic’s epicentre in China just over a month ago.Australia has recorded 54 cases of the coronavirus, the majority of those people who contracted the disease overseas before returning home for treatment.In the US, Apple Inc and Netflix Inc have said they are pulling out of the South by Southwest music and tech festival to be held later this month.The US death toll from coronavirus infections rose to 11 on Wednesday and California governor Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency amid the nation’s largest outbreak.Facebook Inc had said earlier this week it would not participate in the festival.Representatives of the event did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Organisers of the South by Southwest music and tech festival, set to be held in Austin, Texas, had said last month the event would proceed as planned despite “a handful” of cancellations related to the virus.–ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4193698.1583400680!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"california declares emergency over coronavirus and holds cruise ship offshore","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Grand Princess: At least 20 people aboard fell ill returning to its home port of San Francisco from a voyage to Hawaii. Photograph: InterpressAFP via Getty ImagesAn ocean liner that previously carried two passengers who contracted the coronavirus was barred on Wednesday from returning to its home port of San Francisco from a voyage to Hawaii after at least 20 people aboard fell ill.California governor Gavin Newsom said the cruise ship Grand Princess would remain at sea until passengers and crew complaining of symptoms that may be consistent with the coronavirus can be tested to determine whether they have it.The governor discussed the ocean liner as he announced a statewide emergency declared in response to the coronavirus outbreak.Coronavirus testing kits will be flown out to the ship and flown back with samples to be analysed at a state laboratory in the San Francisco Bay area, a process that Mr Newsom said should produce results in a matter of hours.“So we’re holding that ship, which is thousands of passengers, off the coast, and will be conducting those tests and getting those tests back,” Mr Newsom said.Eleven passengers and 10 crew members have reported symptoms that could turn out to be the coronavirus, seasonal flu or the common cold, Mr Newsom said.Two passengers who travelled on the same ship on a previous voyage last month between San Francisco and Mexico later fell ill and tested positive for the coronavirus. Health officials say they probably contracted the illness aboard the vessel.One, an elderly man from Placer County near Sacramento with underlying health conditions, died this week, the first documented coronavirus fatality in California. The other, from the Bay area, was described by Mr Newsom as gravely sick.Mr Newsom said state health authorities, working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), were trying to contact some 2,500 passengers who were on that earlier voyage.The ship would now be held off shore, “a distance away, until all the testing and the new protocols and regimes are put into place to secure their arrival”.53 casesMr Newsom said California health authorities had confirmed 53 cases, the most of any single US state, from the respiratory disease that has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide.The death of the former cruise passenger in California marked the first coronavirus fatality in the United States outside of Washington state, where 10 people have died in a cluster of at least 39 infections in the Seattle area.The predicament of the Grand Princess cruise liner was reminiscent of the Diamond Princess vessel that was quarantined off the coast of Japan in February and was for a time the largest concentration of cornoavirus cases outside China.Some American passengers from that ship were ultimately repatriated to military bases in California for extended quarantines. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"best coronavirus dry run catastrophic pandemic come","story":"Our naive optimism has left society exposed to potential breakdown when a pestilence runs riotFor a brief period a few years ago, a bizarre, ahistorical, Whiggish optimism descended on much of the Western world. We thought that we had cracked humanity’s challenges, that we had ascended to a superior, final phase in the great story of human civilisations.It was, surely, the end of history: Homo sapiens had evolved into Homo rationabilis at some point in the 1990s, the time of Bill Clinton, Cool Britannia and the Cold War idend. We had mastered progress – scientific, economic, cultural and political. We would live ever-longer, healthier lives, holding hands in a world of almost zero wars, managed free trade, international cooperation and enlightened technocracy, guided by a new meritocratic elite of technologists, economists, lawyers and financiers. The global village would become richer, healthier, more tolerant and more peaceful than anything anybody could ever possibly have dreamt of.Since then, bit by bit, the deluded certainties of a generation used to radical globalisation and technological triumphalism have been shattered by reality, just as pre-First World War naivety was destroyed in the killing fields of the Somme. The coronavirus is merely the latest blow, the ultimate proof that the Four Horsemen have not been conquered and never will be.First, we rediscovered terrorism and the clash of civilisations in September 2001. Then came the realisation of the West’s impotence as the Afghan and Iraq wars failed. Our powerlessness in preventing depression, poverty and economic collapse was all too apparent in 2008. We realised that genocide was still with us in Rwanda and Syria, the tech revolution’s dark side became impossible to ignore, and in 2016 the bells tolled for the technocratic order – the only piece of good news in this long list of body-blows to the utopian dream of 1990s centrists. Now, in 2020, the fear of pandemic has returned. One day, because of Iran or Pakistan or North Korea, we will also rediscover the cataclysmic dangers of weapons of mass destruction.It is unclear just how bad the coronavirus will turn out to be, but we are now in the midst of the third major global scare since 911. The last time so many were so worried was when Northern Rock was going bust. None of the previous big outbreaks – such as Sars, Mers or swine flu – had anything like the same psychological impact in Europe and America.We shouldn’t panic, but we must be realistic. The best-case (and most likely) scenario is that while there may be many tragic deaths, coronavirus is a dry run, a last warning for a worse pandemic that will erupt at some point in the future the worst (and least likely) case is that Covid-19 will end up being comparable to one of the four big epidemics of the past 125 years.The most recent was the Hong Kong flu of 1968-69, which killed 80,000 in the UK. Before that, the Asian flu of 1957-58 took 33,000 British lives, especially children. Then there was the Spanish flu of 1918-19, which cost 228,000 UK lives, and the Russian flu of 1889-90, which killed 132,000.Ordinary flu, which doesn’t panic people because it returns every year, kills 17,000 on average in Britain, ranging from 1,692 deaths in 2018-19, to 28,330 in 2014-15.So how does Covid-19 compare? The debate is all about growth rates: will the current small number of cases continue to rise at a very large rate, or will the numbers tail off sooner rather than later? About 3.4 per cent of reported cases have died globally, including in mismanaged dictatorships such as Iran. If the death rate in Britain were to remain at 2 per cent, and if one million people were to be infected, we can expect 20,000 deaths. If five million catch it, the death toll would hit 100,000. If a fifth of the population is infected, we would be in Spanish flu territory, although Wuhan’s experience suggests it won’t reach anything like those levels.But we need to accept that the Government’s reaction to all of this isn’t excessive. It is proportionate, given current levels of information. Even if the number of fatalities is limited as a result of drastic action, the economic impact could be vast: there will be a massive supply-side shock as public transport systems, schools and companies shut down, supply chains break and companies run out of cash. Airlines are at risk, as are hundreds of thousands of firms, big and small. Workers may not get paid or may be fired, and the self-employed could be hammered. Hopefully, the economy will bounce back, but not if the crisis then extends to the demand-side and the financial system.Spread of coronavirus and SARSThis is not just the Government’s problem. We can all play our part in trying to halt the spread of the epidemic: hygiene and the way we manage social contact are key. The real lesson is that we need to build drastically greater resilience and anti-fragility into all aspects of our society. We worry endlessly about so many overblown threats, but have become entirely unprepared to deal with one of the basic risks. We need institutions that can develop vaccines extremely quickly, push through tests at breakneck speed and mass-produce, all in the space of weeks.Pandemic-proofing needs to become a basic defensive function of every organisation, like cyber-security already is. Firms need to practise working from home households need to be able to self-isolate the Government needs to rehearse plans to shut borders or chunks of the country. Is the current rush to ultra-urbanisation and centralisation of all economic activity in London the right strategy? Would companies be better off with more dispersed centres, even at the cost of some agglomeration effects? Areas where workers commute by car, not public transport, will be more resilient.Crucially, the next virus could be much more lethal: it could easily have a much higher mortality rate, target children as well as the elderly, and inflict drastically greater damage. A 2 or even 3.4 per cent mortality rate is tolerable if not too many people are affected, but what if the next one is even more infectious? What if 10 per cent of patients succumb? Or 20 per cent? The maths is terrifying, and civilisation as we know it could collapse. We must hope the coronavirus is defeated soon, but never again must we fall foul of Panglossian stupidity and assume away the risk of a catastrophic pestilence.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Mr Holmes wanted more than a massage.She began to feel uncomfortable and tried to move away from him. She was prevented from doing so by Mr Holmes grabbing her buttocks and thus holding her in place. That\u0027s between his legs.He asked if he could touch her boobs and he pointed to his groin and asked if she did extras, plainly you may think a reference to her giving him some sort of sexual relief.The lawyer said the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was shocked and embarrassed as nothing like that had happened to her in her career before.She went on: Mr Holmes realising that he was not going to get what he wanted, he began to apologise and spent time reassuring and calming her.Ms Strudwick said the peer denies any sexual touching, and read out a statement he gave to police.He said: As I am blind I cannot \u0027see\u0027 - but I can get a sense of what a person looks like through touch, which is the only sense I can use to get an image in my mind of people\u0027s appearance.It is obviously a bit strange to be massaged by someone, without knowing what they look like. By touching I mean lightly tracing the outline of the other person rather than grabbing them in a firm way.As I am basing my recollection only on touch I cannot be sure exactly where my hands rested but there was absolutely no intention to touch her in a sexual way.It was purely to give me an idea of her appearance.I am certain that I did not ask the therapist for \u0027extras\u0027 and am adamant that I did not point to the area of my groin at any time.I did not ask the therapist for sexual services of any kind and I am well aware that those sorts of services are not available in respectable hotel spas, with trained massage therapists.I can completely understand that the therapist may have been confused and upset by my request to touch her as I cannot imagine that she sees very many completely blind clients, who would make a request of this kind.It is always difficult for me and other blind people to ask to touch sighed people, but it is a basic human instinct to want to know what somebody looks like and this is the only way we have.The prosecutor however said his motives were not innocent.Ms Strudwick added: The defence will say that she has made up this allegation. That she is  deliberately lying to gain some benefit, some compensation.The court heard that Holmes did not want to be known by his full title, Lord Holmes of Richmond, at the hearings.The politician, who wore a navy suit and a yellow striped tie, was led into Southwark Crown Court with defence counsel Sarah Forshaw QC and his black Labrador, Nancy.The Conservative life peer won six gold medals at the 1992 Barcelona Games and three at the Atlanta Paralympics in 1996 and broke 35 world records.He was director of Paralympic integration for the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympic Games and took his seat in the House of Lords in 2013.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britons take extreme measures coronavirus panic takes hold","story":"When the Chief Medical Officer addressed a worried nation earlier this week, his message was loud and clear.A major coronavirus outbreak may be on the way - but in the meantime, people should keep calm, and carry on.It appears, however, that the British public may not have been listening.Shop shelves were yesterday emptying of toilet rolls and alcohol as customers began to stockpile for the possible pandemic. Waitrose confirmed it had seen a run on cleaning products and hand sanitisers and was attempting to restock shelves.Contactless card payments were said to be on the rise amid concerns the virus might cling to coins and dirty banknotes.Yoga and gym classes were cancelled, while even the spirit world was affected, with mediums conducting psychic readings over Skype.And across the country, restaurants and hotels reported a worrying downturn in trade as customers stayed at home for fear of catching Covid-19.David Moore, who owns Michelin-starred Pied-a-Terre in central London, told The : We have seen lots of cancellations  for the next couple of weeks, it\u0027s kind of scary. People aren\u0027t coming out. I usually have 12 tables for lunch - today I only had two.To put the minds of his customers at ease, Mr Moore has supplied every table with a bottle of hand gel. But he warned that his restaurant would be in trouble if coronavirus panic truly takes hold. If this continues for a few months like this, we will be gone, he said. I\u0027d say we would have eight to 10 weeks we could muddle through like this. We are going to change our opening hours next week and may have to let some staff go.Patsy Derry, who runs Summer Hill Country House in Cumbria, said: The advance bookings into the year are very thin. There’s nothing, almost nothing. I\u0027v got one or two bookings for September on a particular weekend but all the little mini breaks that people start to have when the weather starts to get a little better won’t be happening.For some sectors, the coronavirus scare has led to a boom in business, however.Black cab drivers are picking up more customers because they prefer to be screened from the driver, it was claimed yesterday.Drivers are reporting an increase in customers switching from private hire vehicles, said Steve McNamara, General Secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u0027 Association.Passengers are telling drivers they value the protection and like the segregation provided by the cab\u0027s glass partition screen.Meanwhile, hairdressers have been told to wear face masks if it would make customers feel more comfortable.Hilary Hall, Chief Executive of the National Hair and Beauty Federation, said the organisation had been fielding a large number of calls from members looking for advice on dealing with the outbreak.Official advice is that face masks don\u0027t make a difference but it\u0027s more of a case of making clients more comfortable. Some customers are taking their own precautions. Meanwhile, mediums said they were conducting more readings over Skype rather than meeting clients face to face.It\u0027s harder to feel psychic energy through Skype, certainly. But as long as we can see the face, we can do the reading, said a spokeswoman for the Mystery Chest medium service in Harlow, Essex.It\u0027s all about reducing the chances of spreading the virus in whichever way possible. Some customers were said to be favouring contactless payments instead of cash after the World Health Organization warned coins and notes could be spreading the virus.One shopkeeper said on Twitter that he had refused a customer’s banknote after watching her put it near her mouth. She paid with a contactless card instead. Another man was reportedly seen in a Post Office branch in Bishop\u0027s Stortford withdrawing £500 in cash and specifically requesting polymer banknotes as he believed they were more hygienic than paper  notes.However, Ron Delnevo, Executive Director of the ATM Industry Association, cited research from 2018 which found cards carry more bacteria than cash. I think this is all a bit over the top, he said.Amid fears of an outbreak in schools, Brighton College, an independent boarding school in south-east England, announced a new online learning platform for its students in case the school is forced to close.Clearly, the prospect of any school closure is a matter of great concern for those approaching public examinations and for all of our pupils whose education would be disrupted, headmaster Richard Cairns said.We are now confident that we have an appropriate and impressive educational platform that will enable us to offer a meaningful programme of lessons, marking and feedback.Estate agents have reported cancelled viewings and an increase in video tours of homes. Henry Pryor, an independent estate agent, said he was forced to cancel a viewing an hour before it was due to take place because the owner had just returned from Italy with a cold.He added: I am doing more video tours rather than sending clients to see houses. I’ve cancelled all my meetings this week and rescheduled them with Skype or FaceTime.Mark Hayward, chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents, said some sellers had asked estate agents to check where potential buyers had been on holiday before scheduling a viewing.In an interview, Prof Paul Cosford, Medical Director of Public Health England, said: We\u0027re constantly monitoring what\u0027s happening to see whether we will get more widespread community transmission.I think that it is likely that we will.

Wilson and Barbara Broccoli have announced.Melbourne\u0027s major events chief is confident the Australian Formula One Grand Prix will go ahead as scheduled next week but said he could offer no firm guarantees because of the dynamic nature of the coronavirus epidemic, Reuters reports.Albert Park is already undergoing its annual transformation from inner city oasis to racetrack for the March 15 season-opener despite the health crisis that has caused the cancellation of scores of events around the Asia-Pacific. Martin Pakula, minister for tourism, sport and major events in the Victoria state government said:All of the indications from Formula One management are that they are planning for the Grand Prix to go ahead.The set-up is already occurring, we would be expecting machinery and teams to be arriving from today through to the end of the weekend. So we are almost at the point where everybody is going to be here within the next few days.But having said that, I recognise the situation is extremely dynamic and to some extent there are matters that are out of control. There are decisions made by the (government) or might be made overseas.I\u0027m very hopeful and confident but I can\u0027t say anything about it with absolute certainty.Google has cancelled its annual developer conference in California due to ongoing concerns about the spread of coronavirus.Google IO had been due to take place in May, but the technology giant has now confirmed it will no longer go ahead with a physical gathering at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View.The event is the latest in a string of postponements and cancellations to hit the technology industry, with trade shows Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco having already been called off, while Facebook has also cancelled the in-person aspect of its own developer conference, which had also been due to take place in California in May.Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks during the Google IO 2019 keynote session at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, CaliforniaArt Dubai, the premier fair in the Middle East for international modern and contemporary art, that was to run from 25-28 March, has announced a postponement, due to the spread of coronavirus in the Middle East. A local biennale style programme of events and discussions will take its place, Colin Gleadell reports.As an indicator how swiftly decisions are being taken, the fair told the  only last Friday that: Based on what we know today, and following guidance we have received, we plan to go ahead with Art Dubai 2020. We are recommending that visitors and participants of the fair follow advice from the authorities of their resident countries.The fair was to have hosted 90 exhibitors from 38 different countries -  the largest and most comprehensive in its 14 year history - specialising in galleries and artists from MENASA region (Middle East, North Africa and South Asia) but also from South Africa, Latin America, India, Vietnam, Europe, USA and the UK.London’s Grosvenor Gallery has been a regular participant at the fair and says: “For the artists who have prepared fresh works for the fair we will do a pop up at the London gallery at the same time, so they get their works seen online and by curators and clients who are in London.”The Premier League has written to each of its 20 clubs regarding the latest contingency plans for combating the spread of the virus.While there has been no change to fixtures and kick-off times as things stand, it is understood the Premier League, which is liaising daily with the Government\u0027s public health experts, has asked clubs to consider the implications if large gatherings were banned, resulting in games taking place behind closed doors.It is understood the Premier League\u0027s current message is \u0027business as usual\u0027 but that it has advised clubs to increase hygiene levels at stadiums and training grounds, cut down on non-essential visitors and keep face-to-face meetings to a minimum.The Italian government is likely to order all Serie A games to be played behind closed doors in an effort to curb Europe\u0027s worst coronavirus outbreak, the country\u0027s sports minister has said.We are heading towards that decision, Vincenzo Spadafora told reporters when asked if the government was thinking of barring fans.The government last month banned sporting events in the worst-affected northern regions. So far, 10 Serie A matches have been postponed as well as two in the Coppa Italia.However, Italy\u0027s epidemic has spread, with 79 dead and 2,502 cases, and ministers are considering new measures.Read the full story.Lufthansa will ground 150 aircraft out of its total fleet of around 770 due to the coronavirus, the German airline said today, confirming what company sources had told Reuters earlier.We are dynamically adjusting our plans to reflect extraordinary circumstances, a Lufthansa spokesman said, adding that 25 of the 150 grounded aircraft are long-haul jets.Last week Lufthansa said it had grounded 23 long-haul aircraft.European airline bosses warned on Tuesday that the worst is still to come for the airline industry in terms of economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak, but they predicted that travel demand could stabilise in the coming weeks.A Lufthansa A380 aircraft lands as the full moon shineThe Coppa Italia semi-final second leg between Napoli and Inter Milan, which was scheduled for Thursday evening, has become the latest fixture in Italy to be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak.A Serie A statement said: The president of the Serie A League, having taken note of the order of the Prefect of Naples of 4 March 2020 n. 0069870 which orders the postponement to a later date of the semi-final return match of the Coppa Italia Napoli-Inter scheduled on March 5 at 20.45, announces that the aforementioned is postponed until a later date.The other semi-final return leg between Juventus and AC Milan, which was due to be played on Wednesday, was postponed on Tuesday evening.A decision on whether France\u0027s final match of the Six Nations against Ireland will go ahead may come this afternoon, Ben Coles reports in Paris.The French government is planning to meet with representatives from each of France\u0027s sporting organisations at 4pm GMT to discuss how to contain the spread of the coronavirus.One possibility may be to hold the match at the Stade de France behind closed doors, in order to prevent the scenario of Irish supporters travelling to Paris. France are unbeaten and aiming to win a first Six Nations title since 2010. Ireland\u0027s fourth-round match with Italy has already been postponed. The Six Nations reiterated on Monday that all other fixtures at the time were set to go ahead as planned.Indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people have already been banned in France, while Sunday\u0027s half-marathon in Paris has also been cancelled. More than 100 cases have been reported in the country, while two people have died since contracting the illness.The Stade de France in ParisThree of the biggest races on the Italian cycling calendar are in doubt following a clampdown on public events that was announced by the Italian government on Tuesday, John MacLeary reports.  .Just days after the UAE Tour was brought to a premature end due to a coronavirus scare, Strade Bianche, due to be raced on Saturday, Tirreno-Adriatico (March 11-17) and Milan-Sanremo (March 21) now appear set to be cancelled.After instructing teams on Mondaythat Tuscan race Strade Bianche would go ahead, Mauro Vegni, director of race organisers RCS, told Italian website Tuttobiciweb on Wednesday that appears unlikely.We\u0027re close to the dates for three big races: Strade Bianche, Tirreno-Adriatico and Milan-San Remo and as we said a few days ago, our intention is to put on the races and so put on a show for the fans, Vegni told Tuttobiciweb on Wednesday.We intend to work alongside the UCI to find a new place on the calendar for these tests, which we absolutely do not want to miss.There has been a big drop in the number of people taking flights - this picture shows a near-empty BA flight travelling from London to Milan:Six more people with links to the cancelled UAE Tour cycling race have been infected with the virus spreading around the world, AP reports.The Ministry of Health in the United Arab Emirates said in a statement that two Russians, two Italians, one German and one Colombian have been diagnosed with the virus. They were all linked to two previous cases involving Italians, it said.Rider Igor Boev of the Gazprom-RusVelo team told Russian news agency RIA Novosti that he was in the hospital after being diagnosed. Boev said he was waiting for more test results and said the hospital food was more than fine for a normal person but not enough for a pro rider.Riders from other teams are staying in isolation in case they develop symptoms. Arnaud Demare of Groupama-FDJ posted a video of makeshift fitness routines in his hotel room and eating food delivered in a paper bag.Cofidis team president Thierry Vittu said today he was told to stay in quarantine until March 14. He said it was a relief to have a deadline for when riders and staff could leave, even if it\u0027s still some time away.Now we know where we stand, and even if the confinement in the room continues, everyone will manage to find occupations, distractions, activities, he said on the team website. We are going to stay in solidarity with each other, conscious that we are living a collective adventure, that we would have liked not to live, but which will teach us about ourselves and others. We already tell ourselves that in a few months, we will be laughing about it among ourselves.Riders of the Groupama-FDJ team in action during the first stage of the UAE Tour 2020 cycling race in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on 23 FebruaryBritish Olympic Association chief executive Andy Anson has emphasised preparations for Tokyo 2020 continue despite the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus outbreak.Anson said a planned preparatory trip to Tokyo, with around 55 people travelling, was still set to go ahead as the BOA received information from every possible source in a rapidly evolving situation.On Tuesday, Japan\u0027s Olympic minister Seiko Hashimoto suggested this summer\u0027s Games could be postponed until later in the year because of the outbreak, but the International Olympic Committee announced it remains committed to staging the event as scheduled between July 24 and August 9.Anson told BBC Sport: It is not affecting our plans in any way, in that we are absolutely focused on getting the team to Tokyo for the Olympics in July and everyone is obsessed with that, that is the number one focus.At the same time we are getting information from all the relevant bodies, so we have got the most up-to-date information on coronavirus, and it is changing every day as you can see with the news stories.But we\u0027re in touch with Public Health England, the World Health Organisation, the IOC, the British Government. We are getting information from every possible source so we can make decisions in real time as we go along.It\u0027s obviously a rapidly evolving situation, there\u0027s a lot of uncertainty about where it goes. So our assumption is the Olympics is going to happen, but at the same time we are making sure we are aware of what is going on in the world.We are going out to Tokyo a week on Saturday for a detailed operational recce, we\u0027re going to take about 55 people, the team leaders from inidual sports. We are still going ahead with that because all of the information we are getting says travel to Japan is safe.Of course we\u0027ll take all the precautions we\u0027re being advised to take, we\u0027ll make sensible, smart decisions about where people stay and how they interact, but we are going to do that because we think it is an absolutely vital element of our preparation for Tokyo 2020.Milan’s Furniture Fair (Salone del Mobile) has been postponed to June. The decision has come as a relief to many who thought the event may be cancelled altogether, Kiki Deere reports.The largest furniture design trade fair in the world, the Salone yearly attracts millions of visitors and is a major driver for the Italian economy. Many, however, are not pleased with the newly announced dates (16th–21st June) as they overlap with two days of Men’s Fashion Week in Milan (20–24th June), and with Pitti Uomo, an international event for menswear and accessory collections in Florence (16–19th June). Hotels are particularly concerned as they fear they will not be able to host visitors for both the Furniture Fair and Fashion Week.A number of other major events in Italy have been postponed, including the 54th edition of Vinitaly, a major international trade fair for wine in Verona (now due to take place 14–17th June), and Bologna’s cosmetic trade show Cosmoprof (now 11th–15th June).Tourists wearing protective face masks at Milan CathedralJapan\u0027s Olympic minister has said the contract to hold the Tokyo Games only specifies the event has to be held during 2020.Seiko Hashimoto\u0027s response to a question in the upper house of parliament implies the Olympics could be held later in the year and would not have to start on July 24 as planned. The Paralympics open on Aug 25.The IOC has the right to cancel the games only if they are not held during 2020, Hashimoto told parliament. This can be interpreted to mean the games can be postponed as long as they are held during the calendar year.However, the suggestion of a possible change of plan was quickly batted back at a meeting of the International Olympic Committee\u0027s executive board in Switzerland.We are going to have the games on the 24th of July, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said at a briefing.A women\u0027s golf event in Abu Dhabi which was due to start on Friday has been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.Organisers of The Ladies Open at Yas Links announced today that the two-day event featuring 36 professionals playing with amateur partners had been called off.A statement on the tournament\u0027s Twitter feed read: As a precautionary and proactive measure, in conjunction with the local authorities, the decision has been made to postpone The Ladies Open at Yas Links Abu Dhabi until further notice.This decision is to ensure the health, safety and well-being of players, guests and visitors.On the men\u0027s European Tour, Italy\u0027s Francesco Laporta has been forced out of this week\u0027s Qatar Masters after being faced with two weeks\u0027 quarantine on arriving in Doha.Under travel restrictions imposed on Sunday, passengers arriving in Doha on direct flights from Italy, or those having been in Italy in the last two weeks, will be taken into quarantine for 14 days.Laporta competed in the Oman Open last week but told the ANSA news agency that he was checked, along with 40 compatriots arriving from Milan Malpensa, when landing in Doha.We were treated with respect and welcomed also by the Italian ambassador but there were two solutions, quarantine for two weeks or return home, Laporta said.I had no alternative. I took a flight to Rome and now I\u0027m going to Puglia.Six other Italian players who competed in Oman were allowed into Qatar.Japan has today cancelled the Tokyo Olympics\u0027 rugby test event in the latest disruption caused by coronavirus, which has raised concerns over whether the Games will go ahead on time, AFP reports.Organisers said they couldn\u0027t guarantee a safe running of the Asia Sevens Invitational, scheduled for April 25-26.As the impact of the novel coronavirus spreads across the world, we are not able to guarantee that the tournament will be held safely at this point, Japan Rugby Football Union said in a statement.The tournament\u0027s demise comes after the Hong Kong and Singapore Sevens were postponed as chaos caused by the virus sweeps through the sporting calendar.The Olympic stadium in Tokyo on WednesdayThe London Book Fair due to take place from March 10 to 12 has been cancelled by organisers over the escalation of coronavirus in Europe.A statement from Reed Exhibitions on Twitter said:The effects, actual and projected, of coronavirus are becoming evident across all aspects of our lives here in the UK and across the world, with many of our participants facing travel restrictions.We have been following UK Government guidelines and working with the rolling advice from the public health authorities and other organisations, and so it is with reluctance that we have taken the decision not to go ahead with this year\u0027s event.We recognise that business has to continue. With this in mind, we will of course support and collaborate with exhibitors and visitors to keep our world moving during this difficult period.We thank all those from the UK and a multitude of other countries who have prepared over the last year to deliver what promised to be a wonderful book fair showcasing, as ever, the exciting best of the global book industry.The London Book Fair will return, better than ever, in 2021.Finnair is cancelling flights to mainland China, South Korea and Milan because of the coronavirus outbreak and will open talks with unions next week about temporary staff layoffs, the airline has said.Finnair is cancelling all flights to mainland China until April 30, to Milan in northern Italy from March 9 to April 7, and to Seoul in South Korea from March 9 until April 16.

We have porous borders and we believe that if the heat is turned up on the jihadists in Burkina Faso they will seek to regroup in Ghana.”Britain is already being drawn ever deeper into the Sahel crisis. It has deployed three heavy-lift Chinook helicopters and nearly 100 personnel to support France’s counterterrorist mission in the Sahel, a vast stretch of arid scrubland on the southern fringe of the Sahara. It will send 250 more to join the UN’s force in Mali in the coming months.But any jihadist infiltration into Ghana would raise pressure on Britain to play a much more decisive role in what has so far been a French-led response to the crisis.The three Sahelian states at the epicentre of the insurgency – Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso – are all former French colonies, as are three of the latter’s four southern neighbours. Until 1957 Ghana was the British colony of the Gold Coast.Just as in the Sahel, none of the Gulf of Guinea states are thought to be anywhere near ready to beat back Islamist groups that have carried out hundreds of attacks on military and civilian targets alike, killing thousands of people a year.Britain has taken a leading role, alongside France, the United States and Israel, in helping Ghana develop a special forces capability, the Ghanaian source said.Last week, British officers also joined Flintlock, an annual Pentagon-sponsored exercise to train 15 African armies in counterterrorism techniques.Given the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Sahel, where the number of attacks has increased five-fold since 2016, this year’s manoeuvres, held in the Senegalese town of Thies and in the desert state of Mauritania, took on an added urgency.For Gulf of Guinea states there is not only terror about what their armies may also soon be facing, but concern, too, that America could be abandoning them to the fight.Even as Britain and France step up their presence in the region, the Trump administration says it is considering substantial cuts to its military presence and ending aid to the France’s Sahelian mission, Operation Barkhane.Whatever happens, Western military trainers at Flintlock say that training and equipping Sahelian armies is vital to winning the battle on the African front of the war on terror. Ultimately, western forces will not be able to leave the region until local armies are strong enough to take the battle to the foe. British officers talk of seeking “to learn the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq”. “The solution is going to be local,” says Brig Gus Fair, commander of the Specialised Infantry Group, a British army unit that trains foreign forces, echoing the mantra repeated by American officers, “African solutions to African problems”.The challenges facing local armies were painfully on display during a training exercise for special forces soldiers from Burkina Faso at Flintlock in Thies last week.Under orders to attack a jihadist camp then capture or kill a pre-identified terrorist commander and recover documents with key intelligence in his office, the soldiers mixed up north and south, captured the wrong man and forgot the intelligence documents.Such mistakes could happen in any training mission in the heat of the moment, even the best British or American soldiers might slip up. But typically such exercises are repeated up to six times. The Burkinabe soldiers got to do it just once, given the time-constraints of the instructors working with so many armies. Amid a growing terror of being overwhelmed, Sahelian states have announced massive army recruitment drives. Given the scale of the slaughter, persuading volunteers is far from easy, however. Instead, some states are increasingly relying on outsourcing the war to ethnic militias – tacitly in Mali’s case, openly in Burkina Faso’s – who have fast established a reputation both for brutality and for carrying out massacres against communities perceived, mostly without basis, as supporting the jihadists.Western officials hope that, should it come to it, Burkina Faso’s neighbours will avoid making similar mistakes. Others worry they may have no choice.The Gulf of Guinea states are supposedly stronger than the Sahel, one of the world’s poorest regions. Ghana and Ivory Coast are West Africa’s second and third richest states, eclipsed only by Nigeria, the continent’s biggest economy. Unlike the Sahel, they are also seen as comparatively strong, functioning states.Yet there are also too many similarities for comfort. The northern regions of both Ghana and Ivory Coast are not just more Muslim but far poorer than the remainder of either country.The jihadists exploited similarly marginalised communities in Sahelian states, using local grievances as a highly effective recruiting tool. There are religious differences to exploit too, both within Islam along the ide between Sunnis and Sufis, and outside it, between Muslims and Christians.A series of massacres in Burkina Faso that has seen gunmen burst into Sunday church services and massacre people at prayer has already sparked anger and terror among Christians in northern Ghana.Some churches have already banned backpacks and placed scanning machines outside their entrances, fearing suicide bombs.If religious and ethnic tensions are mounting in the Gulf of Guinea’s stronger states, the problem is even more acute in Togo and Benin, much poorer, more dysfunctional and more similar to the Sahelian states.Last year two French tourists were kidnapped in the Pendjari national park in northern Benin by Islamic State militants and two French soldiers killed in their eventual rescue.The militants may have been helped, a regional security source said, by locals with land grievances caused by the displacement of locals to create the park, a key refuge for some of the world’s last substantial populations of forest elephant.The jihadists are thought to have slipped into Benin along one of the many smuggler and bandit routes that dot Burkina Faso’s borders with its southern neighbours, he said.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security.

The 27-page document sets out the UK-wide response, with possible measures including the cancellation of non-urgent operations and retired NHS staff being called back to duty.The \u0027s map below plots where cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK. It is sourced from Public Health England announcements and will be updated regularly based on trustworthy data.On Wednesday, Public Health England confirmed 36 new cases of coronavirus had been detected in the UK.Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said 29 of the new cases had travelled from recognised countries or clusters under investigation.He said three contracted the virus in the UK, but it was not yet clear if they contracted it directly or indirectly from someone returning from abroad. The spike came after 12 new cases were recorded in the UK on Tuesday, including patients in London, Hampshire, Northamptonshire, Bury, Wirral, Greater Manchester, Humberside and Kent.Public Health England said on Wednesday they will now be releasing information on location of new cases on a weekly basis.Prof Whitty said all UK cases were being investigated and contact tracing has begun.He told BBC Breakfast there could be a need to do extreme things to protect the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions in the event of a UK epidemic.He said the NHS would cope with a major spread of cases but could come under very high pressure in a large epidemic.He said: For the great majority of people this will be a mild or moderate disease, anything from a sniffle to having to go to bed for a few days rather like with mild flu.And there are some people who will get it with no symptoms at all, but for a minority of people - and this is particular in people who are older people or people with pre-existing health conditions - the risk is higher.The NHS will always cope because the NHS is an emergency service which is very good at adapting to what it finds itself with.But he said if the UK sees a very large epidemic, then it will put very high pressure on the NHS and there could be several weeks which could be very difficult for the health service and wider society.Prof Whitty said he believes there is now onward transmission between people in the UK - which could lead to spiralling numbers - although only two cases of this nature have been identified so far. Mitigation efforts in the UK will be driven by the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011 and fall into four main areas:At the end of December, the Chinese authorities sent out a public alert warning that a pneumonia of unknown cause had been identified in Wuhan, central China.Some 10 days later, on Jan 7, scientists announced that a new coronavirus was the source of the outbreak – quickly adding that it did not appear to be spreading between humans. At that point, fewer than 60 cases had been found. But now the virus, which has since been named Covid-19, has spread to well over 70 countries, infecting more than 93,000 people and killing nearly 3,200. Scientists believe that the virus has mutated into two strains: the older ‘S-type’ appears to be milder and less infectious, while the ‘L-type’ which emerged later, spreads quickly and currently accounts for around 70 per cent of cases. This map, which updates automatically, shows where the disease is now, how many cases there have been and how many people have died: More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/20/17/Ben-Affleck-Jennifer-Garner.jpg","title":"ben affleck jennifer garner way back rehab alcoholism","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Actor ‘fell of the wagon’ just before shooting was scheduled to beginThe director of The Way Back has revealed that Jennifer Garner called him up to persuade him to continue making the film, after her ex-husband and its lead star Ben Affleck was admitted to rehab.During promotional interviews for the film, Affleck has opened up a lot about his struggles with alcoholism and his relapse in 2018.The actor went to rehab shortly before the film, which follows a former basketball all-star struggling with addiction, was due to begin shooting.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“So, what happened was, just as we started prepping the movie, Ben fell off the wagon,” Gavin O’Connor told student publication 34th Street Magazine.“So he ended up going to rehab, and I didn’t know if the movie was over.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe Federal Reserve, America’s central bank, cut the official short-term rate of borrowing for the US economy by 0.5 percentage points on Tuesday to a range of 1 to 1.25 per cent.This was the biggest single day cut to rates seen since the financial crisis, an indication of how serious policymakers think the situation could be.Australia also cut its interest rates this week in the face of the expected slowdown.Other monetary authorities such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are also expected to do the same, even though they have far less room to cut before they hit zero than the US, which had been raising rates between 2015\u0026nbspand 2018.Government debt has jumped in price across the developed world in recent days.This is partly because interest rates are expected to come down, which tends to automatically push up government debt prices.It’s also because government debt is generally considered a “safe haven” investment in times of crisis.When the traded price of government debt rises, its interest rate, or yield, automatically falls.\u0026nbspThis shows the coordinated falls in US and UK government debt yields in recent weeks, which is normally a signal of lower expected future growth.The OECD, a mulitlateral government-funded think tank based in Paris, this week slashed its global growth forecast due to coronavirus from 2.9 per cent to 2.4 per cent.And it said global growth could fall to just 1.5 per cent if the virus proves more serious than it currently expects.Other international forecasters such as the International Monetary Fund are expected to follow in downgrading their own\u0026nbspgrowth forecasts due to the economic impact of Covid-19.In the absence of an extraordinary bounce back in the economy later in the year, 2020 is likely to see the worst year for global GDP growth in more than a decade.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They could pay statutory minimum sick pay or anything up to full wages for several months.Greggs will pay workers who self isolate due to coronavirusEmployment dispute resolution service Acas says employers must resolve workers\u0027 genuine concerns about the virus. This could mean offering flexible working for example.If an employee still does not want to go in, they may be able to arrange with to take the time off as holiday or unpaid leave but the\u0026nbspemployer does not have to agree to this.If an employee refuses to attend work, it could result in disciplinary action.You are entitled to time off if you\u0026nbsphave a dependent who needs you in an emergency,\u0026nbspfor example if your child’s school is closed or they are sick and you need to look after them.\u0026nbspNumber of weeks you may have to wait to claim Universal Credit if you are out of workThe amount of time off must be “reasonable” and there is no statutory right to pay for this.

In normal circumstances, sick pay starts on the fourth consecutive day that you are unable to work.However, this week the prime minister announced emergency legislation that employees will receive statutory sick pay\u0026nbspfrom the first day that they are sick or self-isolate because of coronavirus.\u0026nbspMany organisations offer their staff sick pay which goes beyond the statutory minimum.Agency workers, casual worker and workers on zero hours contracts are likely to be entitled to receive at least statutory sick pay.“If you are off sick with coronavirus, your entitlements depend on your type of employment and what is in your contract,” says Tom Neil, senior advisor at Acas.Gig economy workers are typically classified as self-employed meaning they are not eligible for statutory sick pay. Insurance policies for accident, illness and unemployment may cover wages lost to coronavirus infection.Sickness cover is unlikely to cover the cost of self-isolation or loss of earnings if work dries up because people are staying home in response to the virus.If you have this kind of protection policy, check what cover you have with your insurer.Uber’s “partner protection” policy, for example covers severe sickness and injury if a medical practitioner signs a driver off for over seven days. From day eight, drivers are eligible for a daily payment for up to 15 days.Work and pensions minister, Justin Tomlinson, attracted criticism when he suggested people rely on benefits if they could not work during the outbreak.“Those whose employers ask them to stay away from the workplace due to coronavirus concerns, who do not qualify for Statutory Sick Pay, may be able to claim Universal Credit andor new-style employment and support allowance,” he said.Universal Credit claimants have to wait up to five weeks for their first payment, however. Given that the government forecasts up to one fifth of the workforce is forecast to be off sick meaning that a significant number of people could struggle to make ends meet.People with no sick pay who may not be able to afford two weeks of self-isolationAlternatively, workers who are unable to work because of a health condition can claim employment and support allowance but only if they have paid National Insurance for the last two to three years.\u0026nbspThe rate for the first 13 weeks is up to £57.90 per week if your aged under 25 or up to £73.10 for over-25s. It then rises to as much as £111.65 depending on inidual circumstances.A spokesperson for the UK government’s Department for Work and Pensions said: “Our staff are ready to support people if they are affected – we urge them to contact us by phone, or their work coach via their online journal, to explain their situation.If people have to stay home on less than full pay, more people will get into debt. The Money and Pensions Service estimates that 16.7 million people are struggling or squeezed, and these may be particularly unlikely to have financial resilience to get through a period of reduced income.\u0026nbsp“It often only takes one knock to income to push people into problem debt,\u0026nbspsays Sue Anderson, of StepChange debt charity.“Once the immediate threat of coronavirus does pass, it really must be a long term policy goal to improve financial resilience and the way that the welfare system works so that more people are better able to weather short-term financial shocks without being tipped into problem debt.”Further advice on managing debt is available on StepChange’s website:\u0026nbsphttps:www.stepchange.orgShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It could not find an explanation for the circular crater that surrounds the hole – or a proper estimate of just how far the underlying cavern might extend.Holes such as this are of particular interest because their interior caves are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to contain Martian life, Nasa wrote on its Astronomy Picture of the Day page, where it shared the image this week.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Since they could include material left their from previous epochs, they may prove a useful way of looking back into Mars\u0027 past.Nasa is only recently starting to dig unto the large unexplored world beneath the Martian surface. Last week, it showed off the first findings from the InSight spacecraft, which revealed that Mars was seismically active and more, in findings that could help reveal how the red planet was formed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This new result is particularly exciting since it doesn’t require any concepts that are new to physics.”Co-author of the paper Dr Bashkanov said: “The next step to establish this new dark matter candidate will be to obtain a better understanding of how the d-stars interact: when do they attract and when do they repel each other?“We are leading new measurements to create d-stars inside an atomic nucleus and see if their properties are different to when they are in free space.”The research team at York will now collaborate with scientists in Germany and the US to test their theory of dark matter and search for d-star hexaquarks in the cosmos.A New Possibility for Light-Quark Dark Matter is published in the Journal of Physics G Letters.University of York\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The former New York mayor skipped the first caucus in Iowa and instead campaigned in California on 3 FebruaryMr Sanders was apparently unaware that billionaire Michael Bloomberg had ended his $500m campaign for the nomination and endorsed Mr Biden. He said “Joe” would now be getting Mr Bloomberg’s support, another thing to distinguish it from his.“There has never been a campaign in recent history which has taken on the entire political establishment,” said Mr Sanders. “That is an establishment that is working frantically to try to defeat us.”Among the things he said were trying to defeat him was a super PAC, The Big Tent Project, that had been spending millions of dollars on political advertising aimed at him.\u0026nbsp“Does anyone seriously believe that a president backed by the corporate world is going to bring about the changes in this country that working families and the middle class and lower-income people desperately need,” he added.What Joe Biden’s comeback on Super Tuesday means for TrumpMr Sanders also said he had spoken to Elizabeth Warren, who performed badly on Tuesday. There is widespread speculation she will soon leave the race, but there is much less clarity about which candidate she will endorse, if either.With Mr Biden now appearing to have the momentum ahead of a flurry of additional primary contests later this month, including Florida, an endorsement from Ms Warren might provide him a crucial lifeline.Yet he said it was right to “respect the time and the space that she needs to make her decision”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But lacklustre results from Super Tuesday have encouraged him to drop out.\u0026nbspOn Wednesday, it was announced Mr Bloomberg would be leaving the race and\u0026nbspendorsing\u0026nbspformer vice president Joe Biden.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“I’m a believer in using data to inform decisions. After yesterday’s results, the delegate math has become virtually impossible – and a viable path to the nomination no longer exists,” Mr Bloomberg said in a\u0026nbspstatement. “But I remain clear-eyed about my overriding objective: victory in November. Not for me, but for our country. And so while I will not be the nominee, I will not walk away from the most important political fight of my life.“I’ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. After yesterday’s vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden,” he added.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe spoke to supporters in New York later on Wednesday to officially confirm his endorsement of Mr Biden. During the speech, he\u0026nbspreiterated his commitment to the Democratic Party beating President Donald Trump come November.\u0026nbspBernie Sanders releases ad touting ties to Obama after Super TuesdayBiden wins Texas on extraordinary night as Sanders takes CaliforniaKellyanne Conway’s husband donates maximum amount to BidenTrump mocks Sessions over primary result in scathing tweetSuper Tuesday was intended to be a big push for the former New York mayor to solidify his nomination among Democratic voters. To compete, he spent more than $500m\u0026nbsp(£389m) on his campaign with a large amount of that money going towards the 14 Super Tuesday states.But then, just one day before voters went to the polls, both Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the race and endorsed Mr Biden. The vice president also got an endorsement from former Texas Representative\u0026nbspBeto O’Rourke, a move that potentially helped boost Mr Biden to win the state over Bernie Sanders.\u0026nbspStates like California and Maine were still counting their votes – with the former looking like a victory for Mr Sanders and the latter for Mr Biden – but the former vice-president\u0026nbspleft the night as the new frontrunner for the race. Mr Bloomberg, though, only rallied 12 confirmed delegates as of Wednesday morning compared to the vice president’s 404 confirmed delegates.\u0026nbspAlthough Mr Bloomberg had what appeared to be limitless funds to keep his campaign going, he also experienced multiple blunders when trying to garner votes that included underwhelming performances at the debates.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

During heated exchanges, he was unable to fend off attacks from Senator Elizabeth Warren, specifically when it came to his comments about women.\u0026nbspShe called him\u0026nbsp“a billionaire who calls women ‘fat broads’ and ‘horse-faced lesbians’” before demanding Mr Bloomberg release any woman\u0026nbspwho had allegations against\u0026nbsphim from their nondisclosure agreements.\u0026nbspMr Bloomberg also had to respond to his controversial stop-and-frisk policing\u0026nbsppolicy he put in place during his time as New York’s mayor.He first became mayor of New York while with the Republican Party in 2002. Three years later, he was re-elected with the party before deciding\u0026nbspto leave the Republican Party. He then won his re-election campaign in 2009 as an independent.Jill Biden called a ‘warrior’ after stopping protester with bare handsThe economic impact of coronavirus so far in five chartsThe former mayor then put his support behind the Democratic Party before joining the race as the last contender in November. But, ultimately, Mr Bloomberg was unable to create enough momentum behind his campaign.\u0026nbspMr Trump reacted to the news of the recent dropout in a tweet earlier on Wednesday.\u0026nbsp“Mini Mike Bloomberg just ‘quit’\u0026nbspthe race for President. I could have told him long ago that he didn’t have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost,” he wrote.\u0026nbsp”Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe’s campaign, hoping to save face.

He did not deserve to suffer any longerBut since then, Venezuelans have watched as what was one of the strongest economies in Latin America sink into ruin amid a combination of corruption, falling oil prices, economic mismanagement and political violence.Supporters of the president\u0026nbspsay his efforts have been undermined by the likes of the US, which has imposed stringent sanctions and recognised as the legitimate president Juan Guaidó. Critics of Mr Maduro say he has resorted to increasingly authoritarian tactics to hang on to power.UN officials say as many as 4.5m people have fled since 2015. Many have gone to Europe, but the majority have entered nations such as Columbia and Brazil. Many have tried to enter the US.Mr Maduro’s drew criticism from human rights activists and others who noted Venezuelans already were struggling to provide food, clothes and health care for their families.“It is irresponsible, on the part of a president of the republic, to encourage women to have six children simply to make a homeland, when there is a homeland that does not guarantee children their lives,” said Oscar Misle, founder of CECODAP, a group that defends the rights of young people.The UN World Food Programme recently said that 9.3m people – nearly one-third of Venezuela’s population – were unable to meet their basic dietary needs.“You have to be very cynical to ask that we have six children,” said Magdalena de Machado, a housewife picking through scraggly vegetables at a street market in Caracas.“Only two days a week we can serve some meat and chicken. For years we were late having children. We had them when we thought we were better off, but in the last year we’ve been buying less and less food.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Hook, line, and sinker, I guess. He did it.”Mr Adigrati said the thief probably did not know the value of the necklace.“This particular necklace looks a lot more expensive than what it is, so obviously the temptation was there: gold, bright, iconic Medusa head, so that would have been the temptation,” he told ABC News.Police are appealing for more information on the man, who has yet to be identified. He is described as white, aged between 40 to 50 years old and about 5ft 9in.The thief left just one clue behind – the hook from his fishing line.Senior constable Bede Whitty said he had never seen a crime quite like it before.“It’s fairly blatant and it’s quite bold as well, to have someone attend with a fishing rod in the middle of the night,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As is pretty much everyone  on The Split.The only other ones you really need bother about, though, are the firm’s dandyish boss Zander, whose spirit animal is Rupert The Bear.His partner, Tyler, who “specialises in mergers”, which I think is meant to sound sexy.And Hannah’s unfaithful husband Nathan, played by Stephen Mangan, who’s thinking of getting it on with an office junior called Chloe who is not just the authentic voice of The Split but the entire BBC.“I heard you speak at the Women In Law lunch,” she says, less than enticingly, at one point.“Feminist perspectives on cross-examination. It was great.”Yeah, it sounds like a total riot.You feel for the actors, obviously. They’re constrained not just by the script and the EastEnders rules of drama, but by the subject matter as well.In Walford, they at least have a small choice of storylines.Here, there’s just one. Divorce, orce and more orce.A slightly more savvy drama department would’ve given up on it after one series.The Beeb just ploughs on, though, trying to jolly it along with some insanely annoying incidental music and a couple of guest stars.This series, they’ve gone for broke and landed Donna Air off Byker Grove, who spends the duration of her screen time, as TV presenter Fi Hansen, looking like she’s got a particularly bad smell under her nose.She thinks its disdain for her controlling screen husband, Richie.We all know it looks more like contempt for the show, the plot and the script, which forces poor Nicola Walker to scream: “You have s**t, Nina.We all have s**t.” And there’s another two weeks of this s**t to go.Avoid avoid avoid.MEANWHILE, on Liar, Laura Nielson: “I don’t know how Andrew Earlham died and I don’t care.”Snap.SHE’S McDonald, he’s Dodds. So together they are . . .A right pain in the ar*e.Tala Gouveia is ambitious, no-nonsense DCI Lauren McDonald, who’s come down to Bath, from London, saying things like: “I’m here for two years, tops. Don’t get attached to me.”I won’t.DS Dodds is her dorkish, time-serving partner, played by Jason Watkins, with a non-specic Yokel accent.It could be Bath, it could be Ba’ath Party. The damn thing comes and goes, like the ad breaks, so it’s really hard to tell.Bog-standard Sunday night brain rot, so far.The real trouble here, though, is that as well as a lousy script and bonkers plot, McDonald  Dodds writer Robert Murphy has got a very PC political axe, which he grinds against multi-millionaire entrepreneur Max Crockett , who bears no physical resemblance to the Prime Minister.However, he has got a surprisingly large number of children, a much younger pregnant we and a way of quivering with rage about “the politics of envy” that leaves you in no doubt where all of Murphy’s prejudices lie.The normal rules of quality drama and all the most self-important catch-up viewers dictate that spoilers are absolutely forbidden on a whodunnit.So I’ve got no hesitation telling you it was Kasha, the lesbian, traveller waitress, who shot Max’s secret son, Seth.Begone, McDonald  Dodds. You’re not wanted round these paaaarrrrrrts.CELEBS Go Dating, Towie’s James “Lockie” Lock: “I’ve got it all. Tall, dark, handsome, I’ve got a bit of personality.

I think at one time when they started showing the photos I remember gasping, I wanted to get up. My husband was luckily with me and just told me to relax and look down. It was really devastating.Emily - whose father was brother to Pearls grandfather - didnt grow up with Gabriel and his immediate family, but spent a lot of time with him when he was a young child, and still in the care of his loving grandparents Sandra and Robert.She met Pearl a handful of times during that period, and says she had always seemed pleasant enough when they chatted.However, theres one moment when Emily says she caught Pearls eye during the trial - and it will stay with her forever.During one of the impact statement readings, I did make eye contact with her and she did with me. It’s just darkness in her, she recalls.“Whatever le she might have started off with was just ripped out of her soul. There was nothing behind those eyes. No remorse, nothing.“There was no reaction. When we [the family] did the impact statement, not even Isauro had a reaction. He just kept looking down... I have no words for them.”The documentary also references claims that Pearl previously made, alleging she was the victim of gang rape when she was younger.But while Emily says she cant comment on that specically, she adds: “What type of neglect and hate did you receive and was instilled on you to cause physical harm against your own child that you carried for nine months and birthed Gabriel was brought up by his uncle Michael Lemos Carranza and his partner, David Martinez, before moving in with his grandparents in .Its around that time that Emily grew closer to the family, and she recalls him being a playful and loving child - far from the bruised and terried boy he became while living with Pearl in his final eight months of le.“I remember Gabriel was a very quiet boy, he liked to play and jump around with his siblings and cousins. There were always kids around, she says.“His uncle Michael always involved him in planning his birthday parties, that was their thing together.He was a good kid.“He was very happy then. He was in the care of his grandparents, they gave him a lot of love and affection.I witnessed him hugging both of them, and them hugging him back, there was love there.He did know love and affection. It was just the last eight months of his le with Pearl and Isauro that he did not feel that anymore.”Sadly, due to her slowly losing contact with Gabriels grandparents in later years, Emily had no idea Pearl had taken the young boy into her home.In fact, the first she heard of Gabriel being rushed to hospital was when she saw his name on the news.“I saw the cops actually putting Pearl into the cop car. Her name flashed across the screen and I got on the phone straight away, she says.“We were clueless, we had no idea he was going through any of this.“When I saw Gabriel’s name… we were just in complete shock. My mum was able to speak to his grandmother Sandra and she told us he was on le support at a children’s hospital.But two days later they made the decision to disconnect him because he wasn’t going to come back.”One of the most shocking parts of the Netflix documentary is seeing evidence of just how many times Gabriel pleaded for help.Not only did he ask his teacherits normal to bleed after being hit by a belt, he also turned up to school with obvious facial injuries, showed a guard his bruised arm and left his family members so concerned that they called social services themselves.But despite his teachers repeated calls, the guards report and those of his family members, social services did not deem the risk high enough to remove him from his mothers care.“No matter how many times he cried out for help everybody was blinded, nobody was able to see through and help him, Emily says. “The way he died, it’s just unspeakable.”She adds: “He wanted to live. He wanted to be saved and nobody was helping him or listening to him.”Emily is now calling for a major overhaul of Americas social services system.While the documentary details how social workers visited the family multiple times, no action was taken to rescue him.Everybody dropped the ball, everybody overlooked him, Emily says.In what has been described by US media as an unprecedented move, the four social workers involved in the case were eventually charged with criminal negligence.The charges were later dropped because prosecutors did not prove the social workers “had the requisite duty to control the abusers,” and concluded they “did not have care or custody of Gabriel.All four of them have now reportedly been fired by the LA County Department of Children and Family Services .Why is the DCFS in placeyou’re not there to protect the children, but to help the parents and get them resources  Emily says.Yet you’re going to leave a child who’s crying out for help to live in a home where he’s constantly being abused.”“They’ll make excuses so they don’t feel the blame, but like I tell everybody, at night I know I can sleep peacefully, but they can’t. Gabriel’s face will haunt them for the rest of their lives.Social worker Stefanie Rodriguez and other representatives of child protection agencies visited Gabriels home on a number of occasions.They claimed to have never found strong enough signs of abuse in order to remove Gabriel from the house.Later investigations revealed Rodriguez had never received information detailing previous allegations that Pearl Rodriguez had neglected her other children.Emily, with the help of some friends, has now set up a Facebook page, Gabriels Justice, dedicated to raising awareness of the case and pushing for changes to the wider social services system in the US.Its gained more than , followers, but while its proved a major success, Emily says, ultimately, nothing will ever bring her cousin back.“All I know is he’s in a better place, nobody can ever hurt him again. That gives me comfort, knowing he can never be hurt again, she says.“But I only wish that the circumstances were dferent and that he was saved. I wish he was still with family rather than being taken from us.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not for me, but for our country.And so while I will not be the nominee, I will not walk away from the most important political fight of my le.President Trump chimed in on Bloombergs exit, blaming the billionaires team of loser advisers who pushed him to run.Trump told Fox News on Wednesday night that Bloomberg was surrounded by losers who ripped him off for a lot of money.Bloomberg has joined forces with fellow former candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar to support Biden in a bid to stop Bernie Sanders.The billionaire previously pledged to keep his staff on until November to support the Dem nominee.Bloomberg hailed Biden as honest and decent, saying hes the candidate with the best shot at defeating Trump.The endorsement came after Biden ed from the dead to sweep nine victories in an incredible Super Tuesday comeback.I’ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it, he said.After yesterday’s vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden.Bloomberg previously saidhe dropped out of the race, his campaign offices would remain open in key states until November in an effort to take down Trump.The former NYC Mayor teared up when speaking at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.In just  days, I have been to  cities in  states all across the country, he said.In every place we went, I listened to Americans of every age and every race and every ethnicity and every religion and every identity and orientation.And I heard about their hopes, and their dreams, and their fears and their struggles.Bloomberg praised his supporters, saying, no campaign has ever accomplished as much as you did in such a short period of time.He said this really is the best, most creative, most hardworking campaign ever assembled.He added that there is no doubt in my mind we wouldve beaten Donald Trump in November.And you know who  knows that, Donald Trump. Hes been scared stf of us and for good reason.Every time he hit us, we hit back twice as hard.And unlike his jabs, our punches packed the truth.Trump immediately hit back after the billionaire announced he was stopping his campaign Wednesday morning, saying he knew Bloomberg didnt have what it takes to become president.I could have told him long ago that he didn’t have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost.Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe’s campaign, hoping to save face. It won’t work!Trump added in a separate tweet: Mini Mike Bloomberg will now FIRE Tim O’Brien, and all of the fools and truly dumb people who got him into this MESS.This has been the worst, and most embarrassing, experience of his le...and now on to Sleepy Joe!He later slammed Bloomberg and former candidate and billionaire Tom Steyer, who dropped out of the race over the weekend.Pandering Mini Mike Bloomberg, along with his wacky friend, Tom Steyer, have found out the hard way that you can’t buy the election! Trump tweetedThey both wish they had it to do over again!As Bloomberg announced his drop from the race, Warren was reportedly meeting with her campaign advisers to find outshe should stay in the race for president following her flop on Tuesday.Reports surfaced that an all-staff email sent out by Roger Lau to the Massachusetts Senators campaign said they fell well short of viability goals and projections Tuesday night.This decision is in her hands, and it’s important that she has the time and space to consider what comes next, the message said, as reported by The Boston Globe.Bloombergs exit came after a string of scandals, including allegations from past NDAs coming back to haunt him on the campaign trail.He allegedly told a former sales worker to abort her baby when she said she was pregnant.According to documents obtained by the Washington Post, Sekiko Sakai Garrison allegedly told Bloomberg she was pregnant in  — to which he responded, Kill it!Bloomberg has denied the comment, and the suit was settled out of court, but reports surfaced that Garrison was one of the women who had an NDA.He was also accused of telling another employee who was struggling to find childcare for her kids to hire some black, the Washington Post reported.All you need is some black who doesnt have to speak English to rescue it from a burning building, he was accused of saying.Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren both slammed Bloomberg over alleged past comments and treatment of women in the workplace onstage during a Las Vegas debate.The other Democratic candidates demanded Bloomberg release the women who signed the non-disclosure agreements.Bloomberg defended his use of the documents when pressed at the debate.None of them accuse me of doing anything other than maybe they didnt like a joke I told, he said.The agreements between two parties that wanted to keep it quiet and thats up to them.They signed those agreements and well live with it.He later announced he would release three women from the agreementsthey contacted his office.Bloombergs campaign was also clouded by his former defense of the controversial stop-and-frisk tactic used by the NYPD when he was mayor.In resurfaced audio from a  speech at Aspen Institute, Bloomberg defended the controversial policing strategy - and was ripped for his comments.“You can take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, sixteen to twenty-five. That’s true in New York, that’s true in virtually every city… and that’s where the real crime is,” he said.He added: “You want to spend the money on a lot of cops in the streets, put the cops where the crime is in the minority neighborhoods.“And the way you get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them up against the walls and frisk them,” Bloomberg added.Biden dubbed Bloombergs stop-and-frisk policy as abhorrent at the Las Vegas debate.Warren said that Democrats would not beat Trump in the  electionwe have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax s, of supporting racist policies like red-lining and stop and frisk.After spending a whopping  million on his campaign, the billionaire claimed his first — and only victory — in American Samoa, a tiny South Pacic U.S. Territory on Tuesday.Biden claimed victory in nine states on Super Tuesday, and is now in a two-horse race for the Democratic nomination with Sanders.Bloomberg added as he announced his drop from the race: Im immensely proud of the campaign we ran. Im deeply grateful to all the Americans who voted for me, and to our dedicated staff and volunteers.I want you to stay engaged, active, and committed to our issues.Biden thanked Bloomberg for his support Wednesday.@MikeBloomberg, I can’t thank you enough for your support—and for your tireless work on everything from gun safety reform to climate change, Biden said in a statement.This race is bigger than candidates and bigger than politics.It’s about defeating Donald Trump, and with your help, we’re gonna do it.I will be right there with you. And together, we will get it done, he said.Bernie Sanders tweeted that the U.S. needs new politics as Bloomberg announced he was dropping from the race.You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics, Sanders tweeted.What we need is a new politics that brings working class people and young people into our political movement, he wrote.At a press conference Wednesday, however, Sanders was shocked to learn Bloomberg dropped out of the race when questioned by a reporter about what he thought of the former Mayors run.Has he stepped out  The Vermont Senator questioned.Its the first Ive heard about that.He certainly brought a lot of money into this race. He certainly made a lot of television networks very, very wealthy and Im sure theyre very disappointed that hes leaving.I have no animosity for Mayor Bloomberg. I certainly strongly disagree with many of his policies as Mayor of the city New York.But this just confirms what I said.I suspect we will see a lot of money coming into Bidens campaign, probably a lot of negative ads attacking me, - thats what were taking on, Sanders said.A wave of former Warren supporters announced their new support for Sanders Wednesday, amid the Massachusetts Senators meeting to discuss her future in the race.Sanders said he spoke with Warren Wednesday as she was deciding the direction she would move, and called her a very, very excellent senator who ran a strong campaign.Sen. Warren told me she is assessing her campaign, Sanders told reporters.She has not made any decisions as of this point.It is important, I think for all of us, certainly me, who has known Elizabeth many, many years, to respect the time and the space that she needs to make her decision, he added.Bloomberg entered the race for president late in the game, as he announced his candidacy in late November.He quickly pumped millions of dollars into his campaign — and ended up spending more than  million for each delegate he had won by the end of the night Tuesday.Donald Trump Jr. joined in railing Bloombergs flopped candidacy for President Wednesday on Twitter.It was a short campaign, he said, alluding to his fathers nickname for the former NYC Mayor, Mini Mike.Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And now we must – our very way of le could be dependent on it.In Japan where the tradition of wearing masks began, it was because people who had colds wanted to try and protect others from their germs.And perhaps Kim Woodburn – the undisputed queen of clean – had a point last week when she told me we are acting like “dirty devils” in this country and in this case it could actually kill us.The time has come for a dialogue about how we can call out people publicly but politelythey fail to reach basic standards of cleanliness.Looking after ourselves and being kind to each other is not simply limited to the words we use in the public domain.If you are running a business how about encouraging staff who are sick and clearly putting others at risk of infection to have the opportunity to work for a couple of days from home without feeling they are letting the side down in some way.If you are not in a good way healthwise yourself then take a couple of days off, avoid public transport and enclosed spaces with others, and realise that the world won’t come to an end while you’re recovering.If you are a parent or teacher start enforcing standards on our kids when it comes to going to the toilet and washing hands and eating.Andyou run a restaurant make sure hand sanitisers and soap are always available for customers and staff.And Nandos, I’m going to call you out here. As a very wealthy company you can afford to pay staff to make sure your restaurants are clean rather than expecting staff to do it as a favour after their shts, as a recent BBC investigation found.Your company can also most certainly afford to buy dferent mops and cleaning equipment to be used in the toilets and the kitchen, which staff have said is currently not provided.These very basic standards will help us all as a society and not just in the very urgent fight against a coronavirus pandemic.It’s about having a basic respect for each other. We all want to be healthy and so much of that starts from being clean.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sue, pictured with Harry, says she didn’t realise he was overweight until his hip collapsed. And he had to be taken to hospital for horrible, complex, surgery.Didn’t realise  Gordon Bennett, talk about the elephant in the room. I mean, literally. The kid was half the size of their house. She didn’t notice the lack of exercise and the food Harry was putting away  And the fact that he took up the entire sofa and then some Whose fault is it that Harry needed an op We have an obesity epidemic. It is almost certainly this which has caused a drop in le expectancy in our poorest areas. The first such drop for a century.But now the obesity lobby and the health professionals have decided that obesity shouldn’t be “stigmatised”. Asit were an illness just like any other.Something which happens, without the victim knowing it is happening. This is b******s, and it’s dangerous.And stigma is a useful tool in the fight against obesity.It was only when my own son, during an argument a few years back, told me I was a fat, lardy t***er that I decided to sort my weight out. I’ve put most of it back on now so I need another bout of name-calling to provoke me to more action.My point is that fat-shaming can be very useful.Because being fat isn’t good for us and nor is it good for society. It costs the NHS millions each year. It makes people’s lives a misery. It is right that it should carry a stigma. Remove the stigma and you make being fat the natural state of being, no blame attached.Oh, you’re fat. How did that happen  What terrible bad luck, but never mind. But that is very far from the truth. With the exception of that tiny minority of people who are fat as a consequence of their genes, obesity is eminently and quite easily avoidable.Its main cause, these days, is a lack of exercise. If you’re a mum or dad and your kid is looking a bit porky, get them out for a walk every day, or do some sport with them. And keep an eye on what they are eating.Maybe ration the amount of time they spend online, tapping and swiping away on their fat a***s, pausing only to swallow a bowl of Doritos.This is surely basic parenting. Looking after your kids. Becauseyou don’t do that, they will die very young indeed.And it isn’t the Government that’s to blame. Or blind chance, or bad luck. It is because of lestyle choices. That’s the important word — choices.If you take exercise and keep an eye on what you eat, you won’t get fat and your hip won’t suddenly give up the ghost and collapse.The more we insist, out of kindness, that being fat is no fault of the inidual, the bigger the problem will grow.And now,you’ll excuse me, I have to take the dog for a walk. Four miles.That will lose me about  calories, tops. So still some way to go.INCIDENTALLY, on the subject of these face masks. Me and the family are going away for a few days in April. This will require going to an AIRPORT.Awful places, airports. Full of whacko foreigners who’ve just eaten a stewed bat and wonder why they are feeling a bit under the weather.So I had the following discussion with the missus about whether we should invest in face masks . . .Her: “Trouble is, they don’t work.”Me: “The really expensive ones do, the ones with filters. So they say.”Her: “Oh, right. But we’d look like twats, wouldn’t we ”Me: “Yes, we’d look like twats. No face masks.”That’s the British way. Rather die of pneumonia than look a bit of a twat.We’ve been told that in a worst-case scenario, , British people will die. Almost all of these, according to the experts, are elderly people with serious underlying medical conditions.Just to get this risk thing into perspective – how many of those people would have died anyway, as a consequence of those medical conditions, over the next six months THE “You Can’t Say That!” brigade are at it again.This time they have banned a woman called Selina Todd, pictured, from speaking at the Oxford University International Women’s Festival.Ironically, it was a festive which SHE helped to organise.Todd is an academic and a feminist. She has been barred from speaking because transgender activists don’t like her.They accuse her of being “transphobic”, which she denies. She probably just thinks – like a lot of the population and scientic community – that men who transition to being women are still basically men.We have to fight back against this hysterical tyranny imposed on us all by a tiny, minuscule, rump of deranged activists.It is time institutions such as Oxford University stood up for the principles of freedom of speech.That they fail to do so is a national disgrace.DANNY Baker’s been talking about how the BBC “threw him under a bus.”Baker was sacked for having tweeted a joke about Harry and Meghan and their son, Archie. He was accused of racism.

Many simply have to use local roads to get around.”In the letter - seen by The Sun - the backbenchers tell Rishi Sunak they are “very concerned” that he is considering overturning Boris Johnson’s election pledge not to hike fuel duty.The signatories include powerful Tory grandees such as former leader Iain Duncan Smith and ex-Cabinet ministers David Davis and Chris Grayling.The Tory rebellion ballooned yesterday after it emerged the Chancellor had not ruled out hiking fuel duty, despite the backlash that followed The Sun’s revelation that he was plotting the tax raid to raise £ billion and bolster the Government’s green credentials.The letter warns Mr Sunak not to “balance environmentalism on the backs of working people.It adds: “They depend on their cars, vans and lorries to get about and run a small business. Every penny of a fuel price rise hits their financial security.“Increasing fuel duty also impacts bus users, food prices, public services and businesses. Prices for much , too, go up because of the high cost of transport.”Piling pressure on the Chancellor to ditch the plans, the group of Tories write: “We are optimistic that this will be a Government for workers.“The measures announced to cut taxes for lower earners are really welcome - all the more reason for not whacking normal folk hard with higher taxes on fuel - especially after the strong record over the past ten years in freezing fuel duty and saving drivers on average close to £, a year.”Senior Tory Robert Halfon added: On both sides of the red wall, blue-collar and white-collar, town or country, Conservatives are united against a fuel duty rise.Lets not be the Government that hammers hard working families and hurts the NHS and our other public services by increasing fuel costs.

A Commons spokesman said confidentiality clauses had not been used in settlement agreements since . The House of Lords spent £, on four non-disclosure agreements , all of which contained confidentiality clauses, over the same period. The figures, revealed in response to freedom of information requests by the PA news agency, have led to calls for Parliament to outlaw the use of NDAs in cases of harassment or discrimination.

In January last year, the NHS Long Term Plan acknowledged the need to increase staff numbers, noting that the biggest shortfalls were in nursing. But the NAO said there is signicant time lag of at least three to four years before policies to train new nurses have an impact.

At this point in time we think it is likely, not definite, that we will move into onward transmission and an epidemic here in the UK, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme on Wednesday.

It takes three to four years for policies to train new nurses to have an impact.

The frontrunner insisted he was sticking by party rules, which require donations to be declared through Parliamentary authorities. But other candidates in the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn say they have gone further - voluntarily publishing what they say are full donor lists on their websites. Rebecca Long-Bailey and her allies have called for greater transparency from Mr Starmer, with shadow minister Jon Trickett suggesting the delays were anti-democratic. Mr Starmer criticised this line of attack when repeatedly pressed to reveal all of his donors during an interview for The Andrew Neil Show on the BBC.  How can you say Iaposm hiding behind process when itaposs the Labour party process, Sir Keir said, when pressed on who his five biggest donors are. Iaposve got a compliance team in place who are checking every donation is in accordance with the rules, he said.

So two lots have gone up, another lot is with the Parliamentary authorities as of today, Iaposm following the rules.

Askedshe thinks Sir Keir is hiding something, Ms Long-Bailey said that I hope not. But I think itaposs fair to expect all leadership candidates to be transparent, come under scrutiny, because we will do as leader of the party and indeed as prime minister, so we should be as open as possible to show where our donations come from, she added. Itaposs important to do that because thereaposs always an assumption that you donapost get something for nothing in this world and those who donate to your campaign will expect to be repaid in some way in the future.  Ms Long-Bailey was subjected to her own grilling by the veteran journalist, during which she declined to revise her   rating of Mr Corbyn, saying itaposs not Top Trumps. The shadow business secretary insisted she is not the continuity Corbyn candidate which some cast her as, dismissing claims she is the outgoing leader in a dferent wrapper. Itaposs not the same old chocolate Corbyn bar, she said, before being grilled on the anti-Semitism that has blighted the Labour Party. She admitted regretting not directly challenging a member at a recent event in Liverpool who claimed members of the Israeli lobby including Jewish Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge had the greatest responsibility for preventing Mr Corbyn from becoming prime minister. In my response I thought at the time that I had been implicit in explaining why this particular gentleman was wrong but with retrospect I shouldaposve called that out directly because it was anti-Semitic, she said.

The Government handed a former aide to Ms Patel a £, payout after she claimed she was bullied by the then-employment minister. And we have been told she also complained to Tory Party HQ, but received no response. Legal notes, seen by the BBC, allege the woman took an overdose of prescription medicine after a  incident involving Ms Patel. The Home Secretary faces a Cabinet Office probe on claims over treatment of officials in three departments during her ministerial career. Labour today accused Boris Johnson of “covering up” bullying and said it had received fresh allegations about Ms Patel from Government staff in the past  hours.But the PM said he was “sticking by” Ms Patel and put on a public show of support by sitting beside her in the Commons.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called on him to release the findings of the Cabinet Office probe.He said: “A government cannot be judge and jury over its own conduct – there has to be an independent element to that investigation. “We have a part-time Prime Minister who barely turns up but is determined to cover up for bullies.” Ms Patel could be forced to give evidence under oath to an employment tribunal launched by Sir Philip Rutnam.  He quit as Home Office Permanent Secretary at the weekend, accusing her of bullying and vowing to sue for constructive dismissal. The case involving alleged bullying of the aide at the Department for Work and Pensions then emerged.

He told the committee: #xCWe are intending to provide geographical information - in fact, in the medium term we will provide a lot more information with maps and other things, with a proper dashboard as we gradually move into a phase where there are many more cases. #xCWhat we are, though, intending to do is have some delay - about  hours - to be absolutely sure we#xve got the details right.#xD However, he said he did not want to provide #xCstreet level#xD data on outbreaks.

Scotlandaposs new cases were in the Forth Valley, Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Grampian areas. The UKaposs total is likely to increase again when the Department of Health reveals its latest numbers. Professor Chris Whitty, Englandaposs chief medical officer, said onward transmission in the UK was likely already occurring and the Government was moving into its second “delay” phase, rather than seeking to simply “contain” the disease. Here is a summary of the latest coronavirus headlines on Thursday. Follow our live blog for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak. Coronavirus response moves to aposdelayapos phase Professor Whitty told MPs the response to coronavirus was already moving into its second “delay” phase, rather than seeking to simply “contain” the disease. The delay phase means measures to tackle coronavirus are ramped up to delay its spread. The Governmentaposs battle plan says of the delay phase: Action that would be considered could include population distancing strategiesto slow the spread of the disease throughout the population, while ensuring the countryaposs ability to continue to run as normally as possible.  “We have moved from a situation where we are mainly in contain, with some delay built in, to we are now mainly delay,” said Professor Whitty, although elements of the contain process were remaining in place. He added: I think we need to be realistic about the fact that with so many dferent outbreaks, containing looks pretty optimistic.” Cases aposto only go upapos due to community transmission Professor Whitty told the Commonsapos Health and Social Care Committee he was “expecting more [cases] today, and expecting more over the next few weeks”. Headded: “I’m expecting the number only to go up, and there are now several - not large numbers - but several cases where we cannot see where this has come from in terms of a clear transmission, either because someone has come directly from overseas or because they’ve had a close contact with someone who has recently ed from overseas.  “That I think makes it highly likely therefore that there is some level of community transmission of this virus in the UK now. “I think we should work on the assumption it is here, on very low levels, at this point in time - but that I think should be the working assumption on which we go forward from this point onwards.” aposVery small numberapos of deaths possible Professor Whitty repeated his earlier prediction that one per cent is the upper limit of the mortality rate for coronavirus. He said deaths from Covid- could be a very small number as a proportion but a large absolute number depending on how many are infected.

The -year-old was not too concerned however, and enjoyed Christmas at home in Nottingham with his partner Kirsty Legore, their one-year-old daughter Isla-Reign and his two step-children Isaiah, eight, and Isaac, four. When he went to the doctors and brought up the possibility of cancer the medical experts dismissed the idea.It felt like I was getting food stuck behind my chest, so when I went to the  doctors  they have me dferent medication for that, he told Nottinghamshire Live. I Googled the symptoms and came across cancer and I brought it up in doctors appointments, but they shrugged it off at first because of my age. Once or twice per week I thought food was getting stuck, then it progressed to once per day. Within a few months Aeron had lost kg and was regularly sick. When he went back to the doctors test revealed that he had a cm growth on his food pipe. The cancer had spread to his lymph nodes and liver. During his diagnosis appointment, doctors told him he should realistically think about having months, not years, to live. I do not feel like Iaposm about to die, Mr Williams added.  Iaposve been up and down for the last few weeks. I know itaposs not curable. I was on a soft food diet but now Iaposm on a liquid diet, I have special drinks that are low amounts but high calories. I joined a football leagueas I was about  stone and now Iaposm about , and none of that is through healthy eating or exercise.

I was waiting for [the doctor] to tell me she was joking, that he had stomach ulcers, but thataposs not what she said. Itaposs been so dficult. Aeron is now due to have a stent inserted in his throat so he can eat. He will also have more chemotherapy to shrink the tumour, which could leave to further le-prolonging treatmentsuccesful. The family has now set up a JustGiving page to raise £, to pay for the funeral and help support his family in the future.I want to leave something behind because I do not want the kids struggling, Mr Williams added.

Leah Cordice had claimed in her defence that she was raped by the boy when she was  years old but a jury rejected her claim by convicting her of three counts of sexual activity with a child.The presiding judge told the court after hearing the juryaposs verdict: To be sexist about this,she was a man, custody would be almost inevitable.The jury acquitted Cordice of two other counts of sexual activity of a child which were alleged to have taken place when Cordice was aged  years.Cordice, of Windsor, Berks., showed no emotion as the foreman of the jury of seven men and four women read out the unanimous verdicts.  Judge Peter Clarke QC then told the jury: I have got to consider a custodial sentence. To be sexist about this,Leah was a young man of  years and the complainant was a -year-old girl, the sentence would be almost inevitable as far as custody is concerned. It is all very unfortunate for everyone, herself included, but I was struck, as I suspect you were, by her lack of self-awareness of what she was doing to the victim. It seems to me that one of the evils here is that, for the rest of his le, the victim will know that that baby is living somewhere that he does not know about and that - I can say as a man - would be as scarring for a father as for a mother. That is a further matter I need to consider and the impact that it has had on him.  The court heard that the boy victim would attend court with his parents to see Cordice being sentenced next month and had prepared a victim impact statement. Judge Clarke adjourned the case so that a probation report could be created about Cordice. Tara McCarthy, who was defending Cordice, said: This is a very sad situation all around and obviously, Your Honour, I will address you in terms of mitigation. Cordice, who appeared in court wearing a big camouflage jacket and a black top, was released on bail to await sentencing.

What was supposed to be a relaxing weekend with the family turned into a grim ordeal for Teresa Barbato who couldnapost believe the Brean Sands resort expected her elderly and disabled relatives sleep on bunk beds. The accommodation at the resort in Somerset was not what -year-old Teresa from Port Talbot thought she had booked for her partner, mum, granny and grannyaposs partner. After paying £ for two apartments for three nights, they left after after just one night.Teresa told Wales Online : As soon as we opened the door we found problems. We couldnapost believe they expected elderly, disabled people to sleep on bunk beds.Also, my mother and I have fibromyalgia and my partner is ft ins tall so it wasnapost appropriate for any of us. They ask the age and other details for people before they stay to aposallow the allocation of appropriate accommodation,apos which this wasnapost. The filthy state of the holiday camp accommodation was clear from the moment they arrived they claim. They found that one of the rooms had childrenaposs bunk beds in and they claim there was mould in the bedrooms, faulty electronics, and what they thought was faeces on a pull-out sofa bed. Teresa received an email from Pontins shortly before the break to offer the family a free upgrade to a higher standard of apartment, called a Club Apartment, which they accepted. But when they arrived on Friday, February , they were shocked.  Teresaaposs grandmother, Mary John, , and her grandmotheraposs partner, Douglas Hookins, , both have disabilities. We thought a weekend away would be nice and let everyone forget about their problems for a bit, said Theresa. After seeing the state of the rooms, we said weaposd make the best of a bad situation and just use the rooms as base but by the Saturday morning weaposd had enough, we packed up and went home.  On Saturday, Teresa, who has asthma, says she woke up with a tight chest. I got out of bed on Saturday and stood right in a puddle of water, there was mould on the walls which must be what set off my asthma, she said.  Her mother, Rebecca Barbato, was staying in the one bedroom chalet opposite and had problems of her own.  There was a pool of water in the shower that must have been there for days because it had dead flies and spiders in it and there were black stains in the toilet, said Teresa. There were also exposed wires in the bathroom and my partner said aposimaginea child touched thoseapos. My mother pulled out the sofa bed and there was what looked like faeces on it.  Shortly after arriving on Friday, Teresa had been to the reception at Brean Sands and said the manager offered her a downgrade to standard apartments, but was told she would have to pay for electricity in the roomsthey decided to move. She added that a cleaner was sent to their rooms as well but all they did was let the water out of the shower basin and flush the toilet. The family decided against the offered downgrade and made the two-hour drive back to Port Talbot on Saturday morning.

Estate agent Claire Louise Ainsworth, , betrayed Jenner Scott, , after she was tasked with selling her home in Accrington, Lancashire, a court has heard.Ainsworth - who runs UK Online Agents Ltd - sold the property for £, but told Mrs Scott the deal was only worth £,, Lancashire Live reports.Burnley Crown Court heard how apospure greedapos led to Ainsworth, of New Lane, Oswaldtwistle pocketing the dference for herself. Her actions left Mrs Scott, who had previously bought and sold two houses through Ainsworthaposs business, feeling distraught and often tearful. Prosecuting, Stephen Parker told the court that Mrs Scott had considered the businesswoman - who was tasked with selling the house in Whalley Road in December  - a friend who she confided in. Mr Parker said: She told Mrs Scott that the selling price was £, while telling the purchaser that the price was £, plus an additional £, in cash. The fraud was uncovered when Mrs Scott later visited her former home to pick up any post and met the new owner, who mentioned the £, in cash, to which she replied aposI don’t know what you’re on aboutapos. Police were called and in an interview after her arrest Ainsworth denied any fraud. In a victim impact statement, Mrs Scott said she felt ‘totally betrayed’ by the agent, who ‘took advantage of my vulnerability’. She added: I’m often tearful about it. I can’t understand why she would do this to me. I’m sure that the stress of this caused a severe attack of shingles and my weight has dropped to seven stone. Ainsworth, a mum-of-two, was found guilty of one count of fraud by  representation last month. She had denied the charge and was convicted in her absence after failing to turn up for her scheduled trial. She had no previous convictions.Defending, Christopher Hudson said his clientaposs conviction had been ‘catastrophic for her family and her business’, which he said had now been wound down. He said her actions had been a aposone-offapos and that she had later transferred back £, of the cash taken to the house buyer on the advice of a solicitor. He said: She is a decent and talented estate agent. The business was very successful. She built it up and now she’s knocked it down with self-induced greed. This was a one-off. She essentially is the business as photographer, valuer and negotiator so it has now come to an end. It has no assets. Recorder Mary Prior QC told Ainsworth that she had ‘lied to everybody’ about the house sale and that her motive was greed as she was not in dire straits financially and at the time of the offence and was ‘in a good place in her le’. She said: Nobody now is going deal with an estate agent with a conviction for fraud. Ainsworth was sentenced to a nine month jail sentence, suspended for  months and ordered to perform  hours of unpaid work. She was also ordered to pay £, in compensation to Mrs Scott. Speaking after the court hearing, Mrs Scott said she did not knowshe could ever trust anyone again. I cannot believe she was so pre-meditated about all of this. I thought I could trust her, she said.

His tiny daughter was soaking, her teeth chattering with cold after falling in during the illegal two-hour crossing of the five-mile strait from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos. They had been given fake lejackets filled with useless ­packaging foam by the people-smuggler who persuaded them to pay , each for their passage on an inflatable dinghy. Yesterday, after camping out for two nights with other newly arrived Afghan families, ­Shamsullah and his children were herded on to a minibus hired by the authorities. The -year-old dad-of-four didn’t realise it, but this was probably the end of the dream. As Lesbos battles vigilante groups who are targeting its overcrowded migrant camp – and the volunteers who help out there – the government is changing tactics. While clashes between police and migrants continue at the country’s land border with Turkey, here the arrivals were driven to a ship on which they will be temporarily housed. The ship will transport them to a closed detention centre on the Greek mainland, and from there the likelihood is that they will be deported back to Afghanistan, their home country. Under emergency measures introduced by Greece’s Prime Minister last week, they cannot apply for asylum. Shamsullah tells me through a translator: “We all left our home at night. We gathered what we thought we would need for the journey and just left. “Our village in Helmand Province was being attacked by the Taliban because we are a minority tribe. They wanted us out. I had already been injured in an Islamic State bomb attack.  “After many months walking, getting across the sea was the worst thing. “My two-year-old daughter fell in. She has been coughing and very sick. Maybe she has pneumonia. Now, thank God, she is getting medical help.” As he talks, his sons Yasin, six and Mahamad, four, throw pebbles into the sea. His other daughter, Sahirah, shows me their pile of belongings. They have six blankets and six sleeping bags in bin liners, and little . Kostas, a police officer helping clear up, surveys the pitul scene. “This is an impossible problem,” he says. “It is inhuman to leave them, but people here in Lesbos feel they have been abandoned by the government and by Europe.” He picks up the fake lejackets left on a bench where tourists would usually come to admire the view, muttering: “They would actually drown more quickly wearing these.”  Around the coast, an EU flag flutters as a reminder that this is the frontier of Europe. Greek coastguard vessels are the only ships on the horizon. The latest influx of migrants was prompted by Turkey’s hardline president Erdogan declaring his nation’s borders with Europe were open. He said Turkey had no choice after . million Syrian refugees flooded in. But Greece toughened up security. Yesterday Turkey said a Pakistani migrant was shot dead by Greek security forces at the land border. Greece denies the claims.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/KMil_ADHD_Support-003-scaled.jpg ","title":"dundee adhd group aims to support undiagnosed women with special event this week","story":"It#s a condition that effects hundreds of thousands of adults in Scotland.Yet women can find themselves struggling to get a diagnosis of ADHD, with their symptoms often being misrepresented as depression or anxiety, partly because it is more commonly associated withNow, ahead of International Woman#s Day on Sunday, the Dundee and Angus ADHD Support Group is organising a special event aimed at bringing together women who are living with the condition and to raise awareness of what help is available in the city.Sarah McIlravey, who is the group#s Dundee project manager of the group, sat down with the Tele to speak about the challenges faced by woman and girls living with the condition, and how ADHD can impact the lives of those who are diagnosed with it.Dundee ADHD group gets Scottish lottery grant\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-adhd-group-gets-scottish-lottery-grant embed # secretJfkpjENiJ\" data-secret\"JfkpjENiJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"#Overall, there is less awareness of what the symptoms in females are so people might not recognise it as easily as they would do in men,# she said.#It#s more common for females to present dferent symptoms such as being less hyper-active.

We’re constantly reviewing and adapting our model. We don’t want to just stand still. We need to move forward with the modern trends of the game.“There’s needs to be a balance of letting kids express themselves and being free at certain points but also hammering home the technical and tactical elements of their game.”Of the environment at Tannadice, Courts added: “The club’s invested quite heavily in additional staff members like ourselves but also video analysis and physical performance.“We look at the full player as an athlete, first and foremost, but it’s all in collaboration with the technical, tactical and physical performance.“It’s a club on an upward trajectory again and they’ve got a phenomenal reputation historically for developing young players.“There’s a blueprint and something ingrained within the club. The calibre of people you are working with on a daily basis is great. We’ve got some of the best people around.“If you look at the profile of the type of player this club tends to produce, there’s a creative flair but we want to help by giving them as much information as possible.”Payne added: “Logan Chalmers and Keiran Freeman are next in line.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e5f7607109c29.60228049-scaled.jpg ","title":"hemmings set to return says boss","story":"James McPake expects Kane Hemmings tofor Dundee against Ayr United this weekend.The Dark Blues’ top scorer missed last night’s frustrating draw with Alloa after failing to shake off a persistent illness.Despite creating multiple chances, the Dee drew a blank in his absence.But their manager expects to have him back in time to face the Honest Men.“Kano will come back for Saturday,” said McPake.“Kano was ill last night. He was ill at Queen of the South and, maybe stupidly, I played him when he wasn’t right.“But he’s now almost recovered and we’ll have him back for Saturday.”Dundee may have drawn a blank against the Wasps, but McPake was as delighted with his side’s performance as he was annoyed by the result.The Dark Blues fired  shots at the Alloa goal to no avail.Yet McPake took heart from the creative nature of his side’s showing ahead of a potentially pivotal double-header with play-off rivals Ayr.“We’ll take the positives for Saturday, we’re going down to Ayr then they’re coming here,” said McPake. vw, px\"  “It’s two massive games for our football club and,we perform like that, then we’ll give ourselves a right good chance.“At the minute, it’s sore but, though it was only one point, it’s another clean sheet.

The games are stacking up a wee bit but we just have to get on with it.“We trained on Saturday and it’s one of those occasions when we’re grateful to have access to the indoor facility at the Regional Performance Centre.“It was a good session, which kept us ticking over for Tuesday night, and there were actually positives to the game going off.“Dave watched Alloa and Ayr on Saturday afternoon and Jimmy went to Dunfermline against Dundee United, which was obviously useful for the days ahead in terms of preparation.“So there’s frustration but we took the good side of it, too.”Meanwhile, James reacted to news of the club’s latest financial figures.The Dark Blues revealed losses of £. million at teatime on Friday – more than four times greater than the previous year’s deficit .The figures show how heavily the cost of relegation has hit Dundee in the pocket, with squad and managerial churn blamed for much of the club’s increased expenditure.Financial predictions for next year are also bleak.But the club’s majority shareholder – Tim Keyes and John Nelms’ Football Partners Scotland– have committed, in a statement released alongside the accounts, to continue providing funds.For the manager, who has enjoyed daily support from Nelms, that came as no surprise.But McPake remains aware of the pressing need toas quickly as possible to the Premiership, given the havoc dropping into the Championship has wreaked on the club’s balance sheet.“Some of it I can’t control but the bit of it I can control is the budget I’ve been given,” he said.“Regardless of what  has been going on and wherever  money has been needed, the owners have backed me from start to finish.“I have absolutely no complaints on that front. That has been the same for every other manager they have employed here – they’ve all been backed.“What we can do on the playing side is, as I’ve said before, make sure come April, May time, we’ve given ourselves the best possible chance of getting back to the Premiership.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"where should johns scrapbook rest","story":"Lochgelly resident Gary Lister got in touch regarding his late father.John Lister died in  and was one of the last remaining members of the great St Andrews United side which won the Scottish Junior Cup  years ago in .Gary, , said: “My father was very well known in Fe junior circles as, in addition to playing in that great St Andrews United side, he also had spells with other clubs such as Steelend Vics, Lochore Welfare, Newburgh, Valleyfield Colliery, Dunfermline Jubilee, Lochgelly Albert and Halbeath.“Indeed, he played as a goalkeeper at that level from  to .“My father, who worked as a blacksmith at Rosyth docks, turned out  times for St Andrews, which included a run of  consecutive appearances.”The main reason for Gary getting in touch was his father’s scrapbooks and he continued: “I have three scrapbooks, photos, cuttings, articles from The Courier, Saturday pink paper, yellow paper, Sunday Post.“They are all just tucked away in a drawer.“What I’m looking for is some place to put them on display so others may be able to enjoy them.

advertised.Duff House Gardens has been protected from any property development along with the historic Duff House Royal golf course.Banff and District councillor John Cox hopes these plans will encourage more people to come to the town.He said: “Hopefully this will be transformative to encourage further investment, not just in buildings but creating an infrastructure to support employment opportunities, manufacturers and increasing the local wage economy.”For Macduff, the popular aquarium will be invested in to draw more tourists in through developer contributions.A network of walking and cycling routes have also been identied to link Macduff and Banff and help improve connectivity around the north-east.Land south of Corskie Drive has been allocated for housing development to expand the settlement westwards.However, the report states it is essential “to retain separation of Macduff from Banff to ensure local identity is maintained”.In Fraserburgh the plan focuses on protecting the fishing heritage and sport and recreation in the area.Saltoun Gardens, playing fields, tennis courts, bowling green, putting green, play areas and the cricket ground will all be

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"keep that mojo burning 4 below","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFrom Oban,  Below previously graced the MOJO stage before in  with a blistering set from their debut album Alpha, to great acclaim.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

He was .As a descendant of the famous Ballantyne clan, whose links to the Scottish woollen trade can be traced back to the mid-th century, Mr Brett upheld the family tradition by carving out a successful career in the fast-changing Borders textile industry.The son of an army officer, Lt Col. Denis Brett, and his we Katherine , Denis Roland Brett was born in  in Dehri Dun, India, where his father was serving with the Leicestershire Regiment.At the age of seven he was sent to Blairmore preparatory school in Aberdeenshire, then on to Haileybury School in Hertfordshire. There Rolyrsquos cricketing talents were quickly spotted, and as a member of the schoolrsquos st XI he had the distinction of hitting a six into the stands at Lordrsquos in the annual fixture against Cheltenham.On leaving school he was offered an apprenticeship by his uncle, David Ballantyne, in the family-run Henry Ballantyne  Sons mill at Walkerburn. It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs. He captained Selkirk on their ground-breaking tour to Barbados in , and the following year led the Souters to a Border League  Border Knock-out Cup double.Once his playing days were over, Roly qualied as a cricket coach, helping steer the South of Scotland u- side to its first Scottish Championship.A familiar adversary during his cricketing career was Gala wicket-keeper Ronnie Murray. ldquoRoly was a breath of fresh air when he first arrived on the Border scene, said Ronnie. ldquoHe was an excellent all-rounder, a true sportsman and also great fun to be with.ldquoHe played in a very good Kelso team that included players like John Rutherford and Michael Taylor, before helping inspire Selkirk to a string of successes in the s. You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

ago many of us had probably never heard the term lsquoself-isolationrsquo.But now not a day goes by without us being aware of people who have been asked or chosen to isolate themselves in order to try and minimise the spread of the Coronavirus.Nicole Rogers, Solicitor at DAS Law, has been looking at the impact this has on workers rights and pay.If I feel that I should be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use annual leaveyou are medically unfit for work.However in many other circumstances, your employer can force you to take annual leavethey provide you with adequate notice twice the amount of the days you are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid statutory sick pay while Irsquom away from work Onlyyou are medically unfit for work and meet the eligibility criteria for Statutory Sick Pay.Will my pay be affectedI have to stay at home due to my childrsquos school being closed You have the right to reasonable time off to deal with unexpected disruptions relating to the care of your child this includes incidents relating to your childrsquos school.You must noty your employer as soon as possible and advise, where practicable, how long the disruption is likely to last.This time off is unpaid but you may request to use this time as paid annual leave.If I am on a lsquozero hoursrsquo contract will I lose pay for the time I am away from work Genuine zero-hour workers have no right to be offered work and no obligation to accept work.Therefore, you will likely have no right to pay.In the event that you have been advised to self-isolate, your employer will be entitled to simply not offer you any work until the isolation period has

Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too. From the high kicks in the opening number, I Get a Kick Out of You, to the tap dancing break in the Act One finale performance of Anything Goes, members of the audience will be transfixed.Congratulations must go to musical director Jeff Thomson for creating a remarkable show.CAST LISTBilly Crocker - Jack McAuleyHope Harcourt - Catriona LambReno Sweeney - Holly NicholMoonface Martin - Dan WilsonErma - Jess ThomsonEvelyn Oakleigh - James BennettEvangeline Harcourt - Lorraine KempElisha J.

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC. Kick-off is pm with Kintyre Park the expected venue.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength. She bade her time there, kenning she would be able taeand reclaim her throne when darkness once again ed tae the land.ldquoIn autumn, said one of the children.ldquoAye, smiled the gran.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why we hae arsquo these winds and storms just noo.

And we still hae the three days orsquo snaw tae come, but ater that Beria will huv tae flee.ldquoWhy didnrsquot they kill Beria, then itrsquoll be summer all the time  asked one of the older children.The gran smiled. ldquoAngus was Beriarsquos son. They were all related, just like the seasons, although they fought each other for a place they all needed each other and were part of the same family.ldquoJust like us.ldquoAye.ldquoGran, can we have more hot chocolate and can you tell us the other stories about Beria  asked a grandchild.ldquoOrsquo course, said the gran, ldquobut we wud need a hale winter tae tell arsquo the stories aboot her.

Probably more than anyone  in the world.\"Politically, China is obviously much better placed to put up very stringent controls. So the number they have is partially due to that response.\": Scotland facing chronic shortage of consultantsA WHO report published on Friday February  credited Chinas \"aggressive response\" for curtailing the spread of the virus.The number of new cases peaked in early February and has been slowing ever since, while transmission has escalated in the rest of the world.The WHO report said China had \"rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history\", and in doing so \"has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic.Interventions included the lockdown of Wuhan - the city at the centre of the outbreak - and nearby cities in Hubei province.Elsewhere in China people voluntarily quarantined themselves with their compliance monitored by appointed neighbourhood leaders.Two new dedicated hospitals were built in Wuhan within a week - with many of the beds now lying empty - and aggressive \"social distancing\" measures were implemented, such as cancelling sporting fixtures, closing theatres and cinemas, and extending the Chinese New Year school holidays.WHO scientists who visited hospitals, railway stations, food markets, and other public spaces described \"a sense of responsibility and collective action...therersquos war footing to get things done.In Western democracies, such stringent controls and cooperation are harder to imagine, but the UK governments battle plan includes potential measures such as school closures, putting the Army on standby to help fill gaps in emergency services arising from an outbreak, giving health boards the power to detain people with the virus and stop them from travelling, or forcing those suspected of having the virus to be tested and quarantined under court order.Professor Kao believes the -% figure for peak outbreak in the UK has probably been extrapolated using something called the \"basic reproduction number\", a theoretical model used by scientists to predict the limits of an outbreak.He added: \"Its a funny thing because you want to motivate people enough to listen, but you dont want to scare them.\"You want them to do the things that are sensible. If people dont take it seriously, theyre pretty much going to go about their daily business.\"That includes people who are a little bit sick still going to work, or still sending their kids to school.\"So what youre trying to do is say look,we actually do nothing, these are the kinds of numbers we could end up with.\"A Scottish Government spokesmansaid: ldquoA lsquoreasonable worst case scenariorsquo would be that -% of the population might become infected.

The rest, as they say, is history. Except, in the case of the Tudor dynasty, this is a period thatrsquos never allowed to die. And in Henryrsquos case, as everyone knows, Anne Boleyn was only the second bite on his kebab.The publication of the final part of Hilary Mantelrsquos Thomas Cromwell trilogy, The Mirror  the Light, has been treated asitrsquos breaking news. The antics of the rapacious Henry VIII and his Machiavellian chief minister took place nearly  years ago, yet the airwaves, review and feature pages, and even fashion spreads are dominated by talk of the Tudors. Whether itrsquos their backstabbing ambition, headbands and bodices, or iron-fisted bureaucracy, weto them again and again, like birds to a hollow coconut shell, hoping for another flake.Mantelrsquos work is as thorough and intense an exploration of the political mind as yoursquoll find. That the previous two books in the series won the Booker Prize indicates their artistic merit as well as their accuracy. Those who donrsquot feel Cromwell merits so many pages might be surprised to find themselves hooked. And, although the factual detail is so well-founded the trilogy could become set texts for students, this is the past recast by the authorrsquos imagination. Official, dispassionate, unspun history it is not.Mantelrsquos portrayal of Henryrsquos sleekit, ruthless, tight-lipped consigliere has parallels with people in power today. Those echoes, and the entanglements of a murderous but exquisitely dressed court, are where the perennial fascination with Henryrsquos entourage lies. That his time on the throne was soon to be followed by Elizabeth Irsquos long tenure has ensured that,this era is to your taste, therersquos enough to chew on for a letime. Yet dramatic and richly brocaded as all this is, havenrsquot we now had enough  Isnrsquot it time to look where, and bid the Tudors farewell Historical fiction sounds like a timeless niche, untroubled by tides of fashion. As Mantelrsquos supremacy shows, however, it is as susceptible to fads as everything . There was a time when the Tudors were considered dusty and tired. Mention of Henryrsquos six wives or the Spanish Armada conjured up Jean Plaidy and school lessons: interestingthat was your kind of thing, but hardly thrilling or new.Writers in this genre are in a tricky situation. Publishers want them to be original yet follow the road more travelled, to mine a popular seam but make it their own. If nothing , Mantelrsquos oeuvre is a masterclass in how to go about this. Yet some years ago, before her meteoric rise, it seemed the appetite for Tudor was waning. The German market, a literary agent told me, had overdosed and lost interest in buying the rights to anything further from this era. Then Mantel rekindled the flame to such an extent that today, from Hamburg to Heidelberg, she will be in bookshop windows, kept company on the shelves by best-selling Alison Weir and Philippa Gregory, both of whom have also made Hampton Court their second home.And, just as the pitiless English royals in farthingales and ruffs are enjoying their moment in the sun, so too is anything set during the two world wars, or in Victoriarsquos later years. Like children who ask for the same story every bedtime, it seems that readers love nothing better than retreading old ground before they douse the lights.Most genre novels are looked down on by the literati as second class citizens. That is why Mantelrsquos Booker victories offered such encouragement for others ploughing a similar furrow. Yet having written historical fiction myself, set in the early th-century Borders, I have reservations: not about the calibre or worth of the genre, but about how it ranks with fiction that comes almost entirely from the writerrsquos imagination.As Andrew Marr said of The Mirror  the Light, the ending is never in doubt. The same goes for aspects of all books in which real-le figures play a part. When it comes to plotting, these fixed points become the beads on the rosary between which the narrative is threaded. They might cause problems when interweaving made-up with documented events, but they provide an off-the-peg outline around which to build a story. Writers portraying modern le through invented characters do not have this luxury. All they can rely upon are their powers of invention and the quality of their prose. To my mind, despite the spadework needed when researching previous centuries, that is a much harder act to pull off.With the Tudors dominating the bestseller lists, what astonishes me most is how little of our history fiction has yet covered. In this country alone there is material for libraries of new novels set in the centuries before the Stewarts claimed the throne, and long after the Jacobites retreated to their peaty hovels.

By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than % of those infected.The lack of a vaccine was another major obstacle in the fight against Covi, said Mr Adhanom.Although numerous research efforts are under way worldwide, the clinical trials to ensure effectiveness and safety mean any immunisation programme is unlikely to be ready until  at the earliest.However, Mr Adhanom stressed that unlike influenza ldquocontainment is possible and that the evidence so far suggests that the virus does not spread as easily as flu.The WHO also revealed important developments in relation to how the virus presents.There have been suggestions that there could be large numbers of infected people in China without symptoms, potentially skewing scientistsrsquo efforts to count the incidence and estimate mortality rates.Mr Adhanom said this did not appear to be the case, but encouraged other nations to carry out mass surveillance.He said: ldquoEvidence from China is that only % of reported cases do not have symptoms, and most of those cases develop symptoms within two days. Some countries are looking for cases of Covid- using surveillance systems for influenza and other respiratory diseases.ldquoCountries such as China, Ghana, Singapore and where have found very few cases of Covid- among such samples ndash or no cases at all.ldquoThe only way to be sure is by looking for Covid- antibodies in large numbers of people, and several countries are now doing those studies.

But there might be something , other than where you live, that you feel more connected to. Is that a way to structure an element of representation ldquoThese are all things we could, in theory, put back on the table.ldquoPerhaps therersquos an elected body over here thatrsquos to do with where I live and therersquos another elected or partially elected group over here thatrsquos partially to do with how old I am.ldquoThat might be a way to encourage people to engage dferently with the conversation.Another repeated suggestion of the session was the idea of citizenrsquos assemblies, closely linked to replacing a first past the post voting system with proportional representation.One participant, Corrina, said: ldquoI really like the idea of citizenrsquos assemblies. I think itrsquos really important that we get back down to the nuts and bolts and what people understand by politics in their daily lives.ldquoOur political system feels like a joke but, unfortunately, itrsquos a reality. It plays on that isiveness between people.ldquoThere needs to be a regulatory body that actually stops all the misinformation because how can people really be informed when therersquos so much rubbish thatrsquos put out there ldquoIn the end, people want to have decent housing, they want to have a good le for them and the community.ldquoSo we really need to speak to people whose voices are never heard. We have to speak to people who are, say, super racist.ldquoIt might be uncomfortable to have them in the room but because they have never been listened to itrsquos important to be in a space where we can start to understand each other.For participant Emma, who runs a charity, the situation must work to be more inclusive.She said: ldquoI think there is a more basic issue, politics, whether it is the mechanics of the system or the culture around it, it is not inclusive at all.ldquoI run a charity and we work with young people and adults with learning dficulties, young carers, people who are homeless. And they are the least likely to vote because the system is so complicated.ldquoIf you are a young person with a learning dficulty and you are trying to have influence there is just currently no system to support that.Student Alice told the group that she had not learned enough about the UK political system at school and felt let down by her experience of Modern Studies.She said: ldquoIt was more what they thought were things kids would find interesting rather than what we needed to know ndash we did a lot of laughing at Donald Trump.ldquoI have left school with a very small understanding of politics and Irsquom not happy about that.Tortoise aimed to set out the first inclusive membership model for news and now has , funded memberships.The organisation works with around  partners, including The Herald.There will be further Tortoise events throughout the year.

Mike Rutherford, Tony Banks, Phil Collins and Steve Hackettsold m records based largely on the support of teenage boys who couldnrsquot get a girlfriend and spent way too much time in their bedrooms, practising guitar solos on a fretless and reading Philip Roth novels.Genesis produced album tracks so long you could put one on the record player before going to bed and Banks and co would still be blasting away by breakfast.Now, I wasnrsquot a Genesis fan the idea of worshipping a vainglorious lead singer who wore a foxrsquos head angered me to the point of mounting a horse, donning a red jacket and yelling lsquoTally ho!rsquo at the top of my voice. Peter Gabriel had to be hunted down.But I was a fan of prog rock. I loved Yes and the Yes Album and a bit of Jethro and a lot of Emerson, Lake and Palmer. And why wouldnrsquot I Prog rock was unashamedly pretentious, elitist and to enjoy it was to mock the becircte noire of adolescents through the ages ndash duty, conformity ndash and parents such as your dad, who liked Jim Reeves.The likes of Yes and ELP, to the teenager in the s, were iconoclastic. These bands had the rampant disdain for traditional song structures ndash verse chorus . . . sometimes a middle eight ndash opting instead for long rambling jazz tunes which featured several key changes, dissembled melodies and use of vocal counterpoint. The likes of the wonderful Yes and Genesis paraded self-indulgent solos that stretched patience to the limit.Prog rock was, of course, a command for attention we boyscould relate to. It was the musical version of Lindsay Andersonrsquos film If, featuring middle-class boys from a toff school, olde England tradition mixed with rage. Indeed, the genesis of Genesis took place at Charterhouse College.Yes, there are those who will say Genesis are past it. Theyrsquoll say Phil Collins was once one of the worldrsquos greatest drummers but now he walks with a stick and can barely hold a pair of chop sticks. stage school kid.There are those who say Genesisrsquo reformation isnrsquot complete because Peter Gabriel wonrsquot be part of the line up but you could argue itrsquos  years since he appeared with his one-time chums on stage. Why not invite him along  No one could have countenanced a reformation of The Beatles without Lennon and McCartney, the Kinks without both Davies brothers.Sure, there are critics who will point out Collins and co donrsquot need the money. .But thatrsquos not the point. If we get to see the likes of Banks and co up there on stage we get a visual reminder that the riches of Croesus canrsquot protect from cellular degeneration nor frequency sensorineural hearing loss.We get to appreciate that these fellas might have beautul wives and lives but they still need something to do during the day. They still need a bit of attention. \"I worked it out and weve only done two shows in the UK in the last  years, so we havent over-worked it, said Mike Rutherford.There you go.

I mean actually blow it up. The real internet. With explosives.Boom. Gone. Cyber Guy Fawkes.But herersquos the problem: Irsquove no idea where the internet is. And then therersquos the fact that Irsquom a pretty lazy, middle-aged writer who finds it dficult to wire a plug let alone construct a bomb. I also donrsquot like violence. So my motivation and commitment may be defeated by my character and skill set.Just in case a secret policeman from the Prevent programme is reading this without a sense of irony, I donrsquot really want to blow up the internet ... personally.But I would like it gone. From the face of the planet. At least, in its current incarnation.If I could snap my fingers and make the internet disappear, Irsquod do it right now.This month marks the st birthday of the internet. In three decades itrsquos caused more harm, more quickly, to humanity than any other invention. I struggle to see an upside to its existence.Itrsquos made a world full of extremists. We may not be lunatics in our real lives but once we get online we self-radicalise. Black, white. Gay, straight. Left, right. Leave, Remain. Yes, No. Trans, cis.

We bully and abuse some celebrity or royal one week, and then once wersquove broken and destroyed them we cry and tell everyone to lsquobe kindrsquo the next week.The greatest damage that the internet has done in its current incarnation is to destroy the belief that human beings are essentially good. Online wersquore generally bad and stupid.Wersquove given it total control over our lives. Itrsquos enslaved us psychologically. We tell the internet everything about ourselves - things we wouldnrsquot tell our partners or doctors. We let the internet listen to us, see us, study us, through smart devices and monitors. Then we allow corporations to monetise this information. Wersquore idiots.Itrsquos made us poorer. The internet came along and ate up jobs. It put people out of work. It destroyed our high streets and closed shops. Our economy has been continually, unnecessarily and negatively disrupted by the digital world. And at what gain to you or I  Are we happier, richer, safer  The internet proves progress is a myth.The jobs the internet has created are mostly precarious and low paid. Where once our parents and grandparents depended on a job for le, now our children struggle to keep their heads above water in the gig economy.We canrsquot just blame our terrible governments for this - governments are weak in the face of the internet. The internet is the new invisible guiding hand in world events, and governments are here today, gone tomorrow.The tech giants are like new East India Companies - theyrsquore as rich as small nations, wield power without accountability, flout their taxes, harvest us for data, cause electoral manipulation. Theyrsquore corporate vampires.The internet has changed us emotionally. Itrsquos locked us behind screens at the dinner table. Itrsquos transformed iPads into nannies. People chose their partners by swiping. Itrsquos turned extreme pornography into digital background static. It isolates and dehumanises us.Culturally, wersquore fading away. The internet offers up so much trash that therersquos no time or space for real art, real literature. Therersquos no time for real debate, real analysis. We skim headlines, we donrsquot read stories. Our attention spans are declining. Wersquore changing from a book culture to a screen culture.Fewer and fewer people pay for culture anymore. They want songs, films, TV, books and newspapers for free. If thatrsquos the case then who pays the songwriter, filmmaker, showrunner, writer or editor  Without financial reward, culture dies.Politically, the internet has fuelled populism, the alt-right, cancel culture, anti-semitism, conspiracies, the extreme lsquowokersquo totalitarianism of the left. Itrsquos carpet-bombed the centre ground.It can be changed, though. My rage against the internet is like blaming physics for the atom bomb. Itrsquos not the science thatrsquos wrong, itrsquos the way people have harnessed the science which is dangerous.The internet has the temerity to set itself up as an alternative to reality. You can go online and shop, fall in love, be political, and consume culture, just as you do in real le. Given thatrsquos the case, then treat the online world like the real world.Police it like the real world. I canrsquot walk down the street in a balaclava shouting rape threats. So online you should have to show your face and go by your real name, just as you do in the physical world.Sites like Facebook and Twitter are publishers. Except Facebook and Twitter arenrsquot subject to the same laws as the rest of the media. End that. Drag a few tech execs into court, the way you can bring a real world publisher into court, and things will change rapidly online.And tax the hell out of the internet. If you make a buck in Britain, then pay your fair share. Otherwise face being shut down, or prosecuted.Itrsquos really not too late to fix things. Victorian industrialists thought they could stuff children up chimneys with impunity until society said stop. The world of publishing was a demented free-for-all after the invention of the printing press until libel and defamation laws finally emerged and the crazies got silenced.Change can be made.

They asserted that it went against current council policy, which dictates that there should be no permanent increases to the current officer establishment.At the end of discussions, the council leader received more support, and councillor Stockan’s motion won,  votes to seven.However, at a general meeting of the council yesterday, Tuesday, the council leader agreed that the issue should be referred back to the policy and resources committee, following a further call by Councillor Tullock.Councillor Tullock said that he made his amendment in light of the failure of Scottish Government to provide a budget settlement to OIC, plus the concerns expressed to him by his constituents on the issue.Councillor Stockan said that he himself had received support for the establishment of the post, but he was happy to have it taken back to committee.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If Singapore — a city-state with no rural areas — is the economic model for those who inform this Government’s thinking then it speaks volumes about their priorities. This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are  employees at the hotel who do a fantastic job.ldquoI can disclose that there have been a number of competing offers for this first class hotel in excess of pound billion.ldquoI have no doubt that such offers will be considered so that the Ritz is sold at the right time and for a proper price.ldquoThere is no place for any sale at less than full value. A sale below the proper value would give rise to further litigation. This would be regrettable.ldquoI am deeply shocked and saddened about recent events involving unethical conduct and intrusion into my privacy.ldquoI hope we can get these family matters resolved so that we can all move on.The statement comes after media reports that bids were at around pound million, less than the family had hoped for.The High Court heard last week that the -year-old businessman and his daughter Amanda claim that Sir Davidrsquos three sons, Alistair, Aidan and Howard, and Aidanrsquos son Andrew, were parties to the recording of their private conversations over several months.Sir Frederick and Amanda Barclay brought a legal action alleging misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breach of data protection laws against their four relatives, and Philip Peters, who ldquoholds a board position in the Barclay group of businesses.Desmond Browne QC, representing Sir Frederick and Amanda Barclay, asked the court to make an interim non-disclosure order, preventing the defendants from disclosing the recordings.Heather Rogers QC, representing all five defendants, said there no need to make an interim non-disclosure order.She told the court there was ldquoa lot of information that would have been in the possession of my clients hellip which they have got completely free of the recordings.She added that her clients had ldquoample opportunity to ldquospread it about before an injunction was granted, but there was ldquono evidence of dissemination.Giving a short ruling dismissing the application for a non-disclosure order, Mr Justice Warby said the claim ldquostems from the falling-out between elements of the families of Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay.He said that ldquosubstantial parts of the business enterprises the twins had built up ndash which include interests in the Ritz and the publisher of the Dailyndash ldquoare now owned by trusts, beneficiaries of which include Amanda, Alistair, Aidan and Howard Barclay.The judge added that the ldquovexed litigation arose ldquoover the governance and direction of the group businesses.Mr Justice Warby declined to make the order sought, ruling that ldquothere was no intention and no evidence of any intention to disclose the recordings.A spokesperson for Ellerman Investments, the company behind the Barclay familyrsquos assets, said: ldquoNeither Sir Frederick nor Amanda Barclay have any relevant legal interest which would allow them to disrupt the sale process of The Ritz Hotel, London. The process is being independently and professionally run, and continues to progress well. We remain focused on achieving the best value for all shareholders.copy -.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"Voting going live at lunchtimeoldhttp:belfastmediagroup wp-content uploads   w-read-titles-online-border.jpg -- -- Online March , From street busker to Empire headlinerSHARESShareTweetFRESH TALENT: John Garrity with Jonathan Cariaga at the Empire, where the talented duo will be playing on March  By Conor McParland JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"Voting going live at lunchtimeoldhttp:belfastmediagroup wp-content uploads   w-read-titles-online-border.jpg -- -- Online March , Residents in ‘limbo’ over moveSHARESShareTweetCONFUSION: Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association’s Joby Fox By Ciara Quinn CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"Voting going live at lunchtimeoldhttp:belfastmediagroup wp-content uploads   w-read-titles-online-border.jpg -- -- Online March , Rising star Alanna gives hope to those in distressSHARESShareTweetPERFORMANCE: Alanna Flynn will sing at the Spring Ball as well as release her new single and album By Ciara Quinn A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there. Everybody’s mental health struggles are dferent. With the release of the song, the album, I hope when people hear it it gives them a bit of comfort, to hear that there is always hope”.Alanna will be attending as well as performing on the night of the ball along with fellow artists Joleen Burns, Leah Hawkins and Second Nature.“Invitations have gone out to MPs from across the city to attend and whoever shows up is showing their support for this cause.”Alanna spoke of the pressures facing young people as they prepare to leave school for the next chapter of their lives.“For your entire le you are being looked after by your mummy and daddy and then, all of a sudden, it’s like you need to know what you want to do with your le. A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March . Tickets are priced at £ which includes a three-course meal and champagne reception. For those not wanting to partake in the meal, £ is payable at the door.

There#s nothing to be found.Not a single pharmacy had any in stock, with one pharmacist saying she#s never seen demand like it in  years behind the counter.Already the shelves are bare in the high street chemist stores.Across the UK, Boots limited sales to two per customer last week as the panic-buying set in - but the entire product range remains out of stock across the country.A quick check on their website and the messages range from #sorry temporarily out of stock# to #stock sold out# or #stock coming soon#.We#ve found hand sanitiser incredibly dficult to source.

We were promised a supply last week and it arrived on Monday, but we didn#t even get them out of the box before they were gone.

By Jessica BlackMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA motion for Belfast City Council officers to assess the possibility of analysing animal excrement has been passed at a committee hearing.Derry and Strabane District Council, the mayor of which was blinded in one eye after picking up dog mess as a child, is also considering the feasibility of such an approach.Michaela Boyle was five years old when she lost the sight in her left eye after playing in sand containing the dog mess near her home.She was unaware the sand was infested with parasites.Alliance councillor Ross McMullan said that while the council gets around  complaints about dog fouling every month, just  owners were fined last year.We#re talking about thousands of bits of dog poo, he added.Looking at these sorts of measures, as extreme as they may sound, is important.Mr McMullan stressed he just wanted to explore what was possible. The point is us identying what would be necessary to actually bring in dog DNA testing. It#s not an issue with technology - the testing is there, he added.It#s for council officers to come back with some of those recommendations in the next couple months.Mr McMullan#s motion at the people and communities committee read: The council agrees to undertake its own scoping exercise of DNA testing and to bring back recommendations on whether it is something that could be adopted for Belfast.It was amended to include a suggestion for the council to consider other measure to prevent fouling.The matter will go before the full council next month.Local authorities in the UK and beyond have previously considered analysing dog excrement.Last year an English council floated but rejected a plan to enter dogs# DNA into a database to trace the animals# ownersthey failed to pick up after their pet.A separate council in England ran a pilot scheme.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadLarne tragedy: Inside the family home with picture perfect views where the unimaginable happenedReport confirms UDR members and MI linked to murders at Boyle#s Bar in Tyrone, says solicitorBBC#s Stephen Nolan puts Twitter trolls #who should know better# on notice he will fight back#Taigs Out# sectarian hate note forces family out of Belfast homeOff-duty officer#s bid to arrest boy over snowball incident in Northern Ireland probed by Ombudsman,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Crews dispatched to his address were held up for periods of more than an hour as O#Toole then refused to co-operate, the court heard.On one occasion he phoned again within two minutes of being checked, and while paramedics were still outside his home.Referring to the wider activity, Crown lawyer Adrian Higgins said: The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service has  calls on their system from the defendant to his address between February ,  and February , .He#s drawing ambulances away from real emergencies and clogging them up with his unmerited phone calls.O#Toole was said to have made admissions following arrest, claiming he acted while drunk.He told police that he lived alone and phoned for an ambulance when he feared he was having a panic attack.Opposing bail, Mr Higgins contended that the alleged offences went beyond nuisance calls.Danielle McMahon, defending, told the court her client#s behaviour stemmed from losing his brother at a young age.His anxiety is exacerbated and then he rings the Ambulance Service, she added.Adjourning the bail application, Mr Justice Shaw said he wanted a package put together designed to provide help to the defendant.He told O#Toole, who appeared in court by prison video-link: This sort of behaviour is intolerable.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadLarne tragedy: Inside the family home with picture perfect views where the unimaginable happenedReport confirms UDR members and MI linked to murders at Boyle#s Bar in Tyrone, says solicitorBBC#s Stephen Nolan puts Twitter trolls #who should know better# on notice he will fight back#Taigs Out# sectarian hate note forces family out of Belfast homeOff-duty officer#s bid to arrest boy over snowball incident in Northern Ireland probed by Ombudsman,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Figures released to the student newspaper The Scoop show that more than , applied to the Student Hardship and Student Support funds, which typically award up to £ in the form of a non-repayable loan for those in financial dficulty.It also shows  students who applied to the fund in the academic year   were rejected.Alliance councillor for Lagan River and former QUB student Eoin Tennyson said the money could be a critical leline for some.Finance can be a source of huge pressure and anxiety for students, with an increasing number of hidden costs and challenges facing those at university, he said.Student support and hardship funds provide a critical leline in times of financial dficulty, and it is imperative that students are able to access these funds as and when required. With increasing accommodation and transport costs, and growing challenges surrounding student poverty and mental health, these figures make for stark reading. I would urge the Department of Economy and Queen’s University to review the process and ensure students get the necessary support.While the number of students applying to the fund rose by .% over the past four years, the number approved increased by just .%. The application for financial assistance asks for details of loans, expenses and exceptional costs, as well as a personal statement explaining why the applicant is in financial dficult and why their situation merits additional support. Priority is given to mature students whoseto university has caused them financial hardship, lone parents not in receipt of childcare grants or disabled students# allowance and those from low income families or those caring for a relative or who are homeless. The number of students rejected has risen by .% since  . More than one in five applicantswas rejected in the   year.Speaking to The Scoop, Student#s Union vice president welfare officer, Ciaran O’Brien, said: It#s not surprising that more and more students are applying for the hardship fund. As the welfare officer I sit on the Hardship Fund Committee, and at my first meeting during almost mid-way through the first semester of this academic year it was remarked that those processing the applications were receiving on average almost  a day.More money is clearly needed for the fund, he said. VP education officer Jason Bunting added: This worrying rise in applications demonstrates the acute financial pressures student face, which have a major impact on poor mental health. The fact that so many students are making applications also demonstrates that our university is still inaccessible to working class young people. It is time that QUB took urgent action and ensure university is accessible for everyone.NUS-USI President Robert Murtagh said: Increasing numbers of students applying to the student hardship fund is, unfortunately, not surprising. As rent, transport, food and the general cost of living have continued to rise, student maintenance loans and grants have remained static, meaning many students cannot afford to make ends meet.Queen’s University Belfast and the Department for the Economy have been asked for a comment.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNorthern IrelandTUV#s Jim Allister urges Queen#s University to improve relations with unionist communityTUV leader Jim Allister has expressed concern over the election of the new president of the Students# Union at Queen#s University Belfast.EducationQueen#s still reigns as NI#s top university in Times listQueen#s University remains the best university in Northern Ireland, according to an influential list.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadLarne tragedy: Inside the family home with picture perfect views where the unimaginable happenedReport confirms UDR members and MI linked to murders at Boyle#s Bar in Tyrone, says solicitorBBC#s Stephen Nolan puts Twitter trolls #who should know better# on notice he will fight back#Taigs Out# sectarian hate note forces family out of Belfast homeOff-duty officer#s bid to arrest boy over snowball incident in Northern Ireland probed by Ombudsman,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The figure that I stated was set aside for the purpose and remedial works of property proposed to be acquired by the council.Although this didn#t have a bearing on the non-sale, I now accept this disclosure was not in keeping with code of conduct or standing orders of this chamber. I am happy to live and learn.I have now completed training with the chief executive about what can be disclosed in public session. In the future I will think more carefully before discussing matters of this nature in open session and will specically check and refer to the publication status of any written reports I intend to rely on.Mr Gaston must also seek advice and guidance from senior council officers where he is unsure of confidentiality requirements prior to commenting or discussing it in public.The code of conduct for councillors sets out the principles and rules of conduct which they must observe. It clearly states that councillors must not disclose confidential information. DUP councillor Audrey Wales said that Mr Gaston had called into question the integrity of not only this council, but every inidual councillor.She added that we need businesses to know as a council we can conduct our business professionally and confidentially.We as a council should see all correspondence regarding this investigation by the ombudsman, said Mrs Wales.Mr Gaston said that he did what he has been asked to do and called for the discussion to close this agenda and move on to some proper business.DUP councillor Paul Reid said: I think members should listen very carefully whenever they are given a warning that what is said in closed council should remain in closed council. This is an indictment on the member.He is a senior member of this chamber and really he should be considering maybe possibly his position.Mr Reid added: We have standing orders for a purpose. It is a sad day when elected members do not adhere to standing orders and go out of this chamber and tell public what is going on. Standing orders are there for a purpose and let it be a lesson for all.Mr Gaston replied: This was a comment made in this chamber. I had the guts to say it in this chamber when many members have taken it outside this chamber and ran to reporters.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadLarne tragedy: Inside the family home with picture perfect views where the unimaginable happenedReport confirms UDR members and MI linked to murders at Boyle#s Bar in Tyrone, says solicitorBBC#s Stephen Nolan puts Twitter trolls #who should know better# on notice he will fight back#Taigs Out# sectarian hate note forces family out of Belfast homeOff-duty officer#s bid to arrest boy over snowball incident in Northern Ireland probed by Ombudsman,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.”Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed.“It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!“I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble.“I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above.There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

McDonagh admitted that the win was important for team morale.“Our first win of the season means it gives us a wee bit of confidence going into the Waterford, so yeah it was important to win,” he said. “We have got a bit of confidence now and I know all the boys will be looking forward to the Waterford match.“We’ll be going there looking to exploit them and get three points again, because that feeling of getting three points against Bohs is special and we want to get as many points as possible.”The importance of keeping a clean sheet was not lost on the Derry City players, particularly after two scoreless draws between the club last season.“Whenever we came in at half-time the manager talked about making sure we keep a clean-sheet,” McDonagh continued. “Obviously we felt comfortable in the first half and knew that we were doing quite well and knew that we just needed to get that goal and keep a clean-sheet.“If you keep a clean-sheet in this league you have a good chance in winning games, so we done that and that’s credit to the back-four and everyone as a whole, but as I said keeping clean-sheets are ideal. “It will stand us in good stead and we’ll be looking to keep this momentum going and hopefully we can get a few more clean-sheets, because I’m sure we have got the players to win us more games.” googletag.cmd.push ImportantMcDonagh heaped praise on goal scorer Stephen Mallon, who made a memorable contribution on his first start for the club.“That’s why Stevie was brought to the club and we see that in training every day and that’s why he was given his chance,” he explained.“It’s important in those close games that we take our chances and Stevie did that tonight. It was a bit of magic from him and it’s a great goal from him. I think it was important to get up and running and get the three points, as it will do the team a world of good.”McDonagh is now hoping that the Candystripes can build on the momentum from Friday, both inidually and collectively.“There were a lot of good performances and we looked solid at the back and the whole team collectively you could see we are starting to come together, things are starting to work and we can only get better from now,” he stated. “Waltergetting his goal will also do him the world of good as well and it’s good to get two dferent goalscorers and it will give the boys confidence.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns directly with the British government in the weeks to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down District has two of worst roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District. It is important that all road repairs are carried out to a high standard to that the work will last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down GAA.jpg","title":"Down goals revive hopes  ","story":"DOWN left it late before getting the better of Longford at a bitterly cold Pairc Esler on Saturday night.Itrsquos ever so tight now in the race for second place behind an unbeaten Cork in the Division  table with Down, Longford, Derry and Offaly all on five points after four games.Saturdayrsquos game seemed to be heading for a draw as the sides were locked at - to - with less than  minutes remaining.However, two late goals from Cory Quinn and James Guinness put paid to a brave Longford challenge as Down ran out two point winners.Longford were dealt a blow before the game with star forward Rian Brady ruled out with a chest infection and his replacement, Peter Lynn, who scored two points in the early exchanges, had to go off injured after  minutes.It was Lynn who opened the scoring in the first minute, but Downrsquos fleet-footed set of forwards quickly got into gear and created scores for Barryand Darren OrsquoHagan before Liam Connerton brought the sides level again in the sixth minute.Cory Quinn and Lynn swapped scores as did Jonny Flynn and Darren Gallagher to leave the sides in deadlock at - apiece after  minutes.Flynn and Donal OrsquoHare then edged Down two clear as the first half headed for conclusion, but a total of six points were scored in added time.Gallagher and a rsquo from lsquokeeper Paddy Collum made it - apiece, but Kevin McKernan pointed Down back into the lead. This advantage was quickly cancelled out by Gallagher, but Down continued to press and further scores from Liam Kerr and Barry OrsquoHagan sent the home side into the break with a - to - lead.Down controlled play at the start of the second half and points from OrsquoHare and Quinn stretched their lead to four points.However, no sooner had the Down supporters started to relax as their side moved well clear, when Longford roared back with - without reply to take a shock - to - lead.Connerton rocked the boat when he goaled out of nothing and when Dessie Reynolds and Gallaghertagged on points, the visitors were suddenly in the driving seat.Down now faced an uphill task, but they refused to panic and with  minutes gone Liam Kerr started the fightback with a point from play.Barry OrsquoHagan converted a free and it was suddenly all square again, but the predatory Quinn pounced to give Down a - to - lead with five minutes remaining with a well-worked goal.A free from Daniel Mimnagh another rsquo from Collum saw Longford trail by a single point with only a matter of minutes left on the clock.Down really went for broke at this stage and they were rewarded when James Guinness showed his versatility with a cool finish when he put the home side into an unassailable - to - lead with the  minutes almost up.Longford never stopped trying, but all they had to show for their efforts was another Mimnagh point.Down take to the road again this weekend when they head to OrsquoConnor Park to take on Offaly on Sunday afternoon for another must win game.Down: R Burns, S Annett, P Murdock, R McAleenan, G Collins, D OrsquoHagan , B McArdle, J Flynn , D Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , K McKernan , L KerrD OrsquoHare , A Morgan, C Quinn .

I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it. This common-sense approach is very welcome.ldquoThe government department has confirmed that the review will commence in the coming months, with Ms Mallon seeking views and asking stakeholders to engage with the process.

However, the securing and locating of a temporary mobile facility for the short-term was welcome.Mr McGrath said that while the building was able to use a generator provided by the contractor for the switching-on of a sustainable Christmas tree provided by the council, the generator did not remain in place.He continued: ldquoI have contacted council and made representations and have been told the relevant committee has discussed and approved the long-term use of a generator which will allow activities to commence soon.

At the time, DfE said: “He intends to report to the department before the end of the year”. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

However, more than two months after that deadline there is still no sign of either report - even though there are multiple stories from RHI claimants who say they are facing financial dficulties as a result of the department’s actions.Three sources have told the News Letter that Mr Buglass delivered his report to the department some time ago. One source said that the department refused to accept it without changes being made.In January, the department’s DUP minister, Diane Dodds, told the Assembly that the reports should arrive “reasonably soon” and “I will share the information on their outcomes with the Committee for the Economy as soon as it is available to me”.The RHI Inquiry heard evidence – which civil servants disputed – that the consultants’ report which they used to justy the creation of RHI in the first place had initially recommended that they should not undertake such a scheme but that they had altered their recommendations at the request of civil servants.A DfE spokesman said: “The final report on Cornwall Insight’s tarf review was received by the department last week and is being closely considered. Andrew Buglass’ report has not been finalised. The outcomes of both pieces of work will be made public in due course.”When askedit was attempting to get Mr Buglass to change his report, DfE said it “has not sought, nor will it seek, to fetter Andrew Buglass’ discretion or independence in preparing his report”.Mr Buglass declined to comment.When asked why his report had not been finished, Mr Buglass declined to comment.Former Stormont energy minister Lord Empey, who secured the concession that independent experts would examine the department’s work, said that many peers “feel kind of cheated on this”He said that he had only withdrawn an amendment to the RHI legislation because of a public commitment on behalf of the department that there would be “a process designed to alleviate the distress that some legitimate users of the scheme were suffering” but there had been “foot-dragging” from the department ever since.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This would be regrettable.ldquoI am deeply shocked and saddened about recent events involving unethical conduct and intrusion into my privacy.ldquoI hope we can get these family matters resolved so that we can all move on.The statement comes after media reports that bids were at around pound million, less than the family had hoped for.The High Court heard last week that the -year-old businessman and his daughter Amanda claim that Sir Davidrsquos three sons, Alistair, Aidan and Howard, and Aidanrsquos son Andrew, were parties to the recording of their private conversations over several months.Sir Frederick and Amanda Barclay brought a legal action alleging misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breach of data protection laws against their four relatives, and Philip Peters, who ldquoholds a board position in the Barclay group of businesses.Desmond Browne QC, representing Sir Frederick and Amanda Barclay, asked the court to make an interim non-disclosure order, preventing the defendants from disclosing the recordings.Heather Rogers QC, representing all five defendants, said there no need to make an interim non-disclosure order.She told the court there was ldquoa lot of information that would have been in the possession of my clients hellip which they have got completely free of the recordings.She added that her clients had ldquoample opportunity to ldquospread it about before an injunction was granted, but there was ldquono evidence of dissemination.Giving a short ruling dismissing the application for a non-disclosure order, Mr Justice Warby said the claim ldquostems from the falling-out between elements of the families of Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay.He said that ldquosubstantial parts of the business enterprises the twins had built up ndash which include interests in the Ritz and the publisher of the Dailyndash ldquoare now owned by trusts, beneficiaries of which include Amanda, Alistair, Aidan and Howard Barclay.The judge added that the ldquovexed litigation arose ldquoover the governance and direction of the group businesses.Mr Justice Warby declined to make the order sought, ruling that ldquothere was no intention and no evidence of any intention to disclose the recordings.A spokesperson for Ellerman Investments, the company behind the Barclay familyrsquos assets, said: ldquoNeither Sir Frederick nor Amanda Barclay have any relevant legal interest which would allow them to disrupt the sale process of The Ritz Hotel, London.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
