Anyone who writes about apocalypse today is bound to acknowledge that humans have worried and theorised about it for as long as they have worried and theorised about anything at some point, the writer is guaranteed to employ the word “eschatological” as a nod to the fact that apocalypse is an essential principle of major and minor religions. Yet for a foundational concept it’s quite hard to pin down. Just as “reality” is elusive in a once-fragmented world that has (very creatively) reassembled itself online, the apocalypse can apply to whatever you want it to: the Greek root means to uncover or reveal, hence the Book of Revelation, hence the hard truths we learn about humanity’s consequential inaction in every apocalypse story. Marxist revolution can be an apocalypse relationship experts speak about the “Four Horsemen” of orce. Apocalypse is a shifting abstraction, a deceptively neat encapsulation of cascading associations and ideas. The End is endlessly debatable, everywhere and nowhere, relative, adaptable, accommodating to many levels of interpretation. As the funny refrain in Bong Joon-ho’s apocalyptic film Parasite goes, it’s “so metaphorical”.Even lovers of hermeneutics will hedge their bets. After all, a non-metaphorical apocalypse could result from a few types of disaster, arriving suddenly or accumulating gradually over time: climate catastrophe a nuclear war an unlikely asteroid a pandemic – likely not the current one – that can’t be contained. While most stories that imagine the apocalypse are not realistic (zombies are another metaphor, the rapid-onset ice age depicted in The Day After Tomorrow a misguided extrapolation, and the Bible not in fact meant to be taken literally) the anxiety that surrounds them comes from a deep sense of pragmatism. Prevailing opinion these days is that the apocalypse is not only going to take place, it’s more likely to take place than ever, especially if you plot the rate of its increasing likelihood on a logarithmic scale very few people know how to read. Plots of all kinds tend to make people very excited. If the worst could happen, it only makes sense that you should act as if it will. Especially if you have children.Here lies the conflict at the centre of Mark O’Connell’s new book, Notes from an Apocalypse: A Personal Journey to the End of the World and Back. The indefinite article, “an” apocalypse, provides a clue to his inclinations. He has a PhD in English literature and notes that “throughout my 20s and into my 30s, the writers who seemed to me to possess the truest vision of the world … were those who rejected most thoroughly the idea that life might be on aggregate a good thing”. Yet we encounter him hovering uneasily in the space between theory and reality, existing in the break of WB Yeats’s line, “The best lack all conviction, while the worst  Are full of passionate intensity”. The merely intellectual approach, untested by actually pressing circumstances, has lately been failing him. On-the-nose signs of impending doom are all around, bombarding him with images of contemporary discord, and they’re really freaking him out.Given its publication date in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, critics are calling this book timely, appropriate and prescient. Though the possibility of a pandemic only comes up occasionally in the book, as one option in a series of hypothetical catastrophes, current events generally support O’Connell’s attitude, which is that any collapse will be the result of a complicated system of effects from which a single cause cannot be determined. (If he had to say, though, he would likely reply: “Because capitalism”.) “It was the end of the world, and I was sitting on the couch watching cartoons with my son,” O’Connell writes. As his son giggles at the show, about a little girl and “the comic scrapes she gets embroiled in with her long-suffering bear companion”, dad holds his phone – “my eschatology handset, my streaming service of last things” – above his child’s head, scrolling through Twitter. He stumbles on a video advertised as “soul-crushing” and “heart-wrenching” naturally, he clicks. Set to a “slow and mournful glissando” played by a cello, the video warns of the effects of climate change and features an “emaciated polar bear dragging itself across a rocky terrain” in search of a morsel of sustenance. It gives O’Connell “moral vertigo, resulting from the fact that the very technology that allowed me to witness the final pathetic tribulations of this emaciated beast was in fact a cause of the animal’s suffering in the first place”. The “absurd juxtaposition” of cartoon and real bear makes him feel “a surge of shame and sadness at the world my son would be forced to live in, a shame and sadness that I in turn was passing on to him”.This is the end of 2016, “the winter of an ignoble year”, when “the more or less hourly vibration in my pocket was a kind of post-traumatic thrum, a bracing for whatever fresh hell I was about to peer into.” Were he childless, or less aware of the reality that humanity demonstrates a horrible resilience in the face of struggle, and suffering is often never redeemed, he’d probably prefer to die in the apocalypse than to pursue whatever violent, desperate life might come after, not that he would have much choice in the matter. “Whatever form the apocalypse came in,” he tells a friend who admits to keeping a well-stocked “go-bag” under her bed, “I would almost certainly be in the first wave of deaths. We both laughed, but I think she knew that I was not entirely joking.” Unsettled, he muses that, “as an inidual, as a parent, I wanted the world to live on after me … But perhaps the reasons for my interest in the end of the world were more complicated than I was prepared to acknowledge. Perhaps my terrors and my desires were more intimately related than I knew.”The last four years have seen a spate of articles wondering, in the age of climate crisis and denial: “Is it OK to have a child?” Most writers decide it is, coalescing around the joy of family as a collective good and the (unproven) belief that parenthood may spur people to action on behalf of their children. In 2016 O’Connell’s son is already three, so gaming out the ethics of reproduction is not a thought experiment he bothers long with. This is the closest thing he has to pressing circumstances – for now – so instead he sets out on a series of “perverse pilgrimages” to “landscapes both real and imaginary where the end of the world could be glimpsed”. The internet is followed by a sojourn to the South Dakota prairie, where a former army munitions facility is being transformed into a “survival shelter community” of customisable bunkers for obnoxious upper-middle-class preppers, whose notoriously overboard internet rabbit holes O’Connell has also explored.Then he goes to New Zealand, which truly rich libertarian venture capitalists such as Peter Thiel have designated the optimal place to wait out “systemic collapse” – and where professed socialists such as O’Connell might see the Second Coming in their progressive young prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who has explicity prioritised her citizens’ wellbeing over economic growth. At a conference on Mars colonialisation in Los Angeles he attends a talk called “Liberty in Space” and reflects on how the “fundamentally male narrative of exit, of escape as a means toward the nobility of self-determination” dovetails with American capitalism if Mars is the backup when Earth is uninhabitable, someone is going to have to be in charge of it.On a camping retreat in a remote, rewilded area of the Scottish Highlands – arranged by a group that believes climate catastrophe is “inevitable”, so people should “hope beyond hope” for a better world to come by learning to reintegrate with nature – he reflects on Dr Seuss’s classic climate-change parable, The Lorax, which he has read to his son. Finally, he and a friend visit the Chernobyl exclusion zone, where they take a depressing guided tour through what he sees as both “the ruins of a collapsed utopian project, a vast crumbling monument to an abandoned past” and “an immersive simulation of the future, an image of what will come in our wake”.There’s a lot of area to cover between not yet and too late. O’Connell zigzags across it many times, but he sticks to well-trodden paths, from relatable observations about his own ultimately hypocrisies to theoretical interpretations: the apocalypse as patriarchy, as white-supremacy, as colonialism, as genocide, as luxury consumerism, as a projection of the inidual’s anxiety about his own death, as “nostalgia for the future”. (Thankfully, there are no charts attempting to represent messianic time.) After apologising for travelling to all the locations in the book by plane, acknowledging his carbon footprint is “as broad and deep and indelible as my guilt”, he declares: “My days are a procession of last things, seals opened. I myself am the apocalypse of which I speak. That is the prophesy of this book.”By the end, he fulfils this prophesy by ending up where he started, looking at the news on his phone, but he feels better. “I wonder now whether it is because of or despite the strange series of pilgrimages I have been on that I have come at last to this place of accommodation … it became apparent to me that a state of perpetual anxiety was no way to live. It constituted a kind of retreat, and that that retreat was a kind of dying.” Through what he thinks could be “exposure therapy”, he’s learned to accept that “we have no idea what might come to pass”, but in the meantime being alive is at least “interesting”, in the precocious words of his young son.In a blurb, the novelist Jenny Offill describes O’Connell as “a genius guide through all the circles of imagined or anticipated doom”, and reading his descriptions of his tour of Chernobyl, I thought the word “guide” was very apt. At one point, the group goes into an abandoned school and finds a room in which “a dozen or so toddler-size chairs were arranged in a circle, and on each was perched a rotting doll or distempered teddy bear”. O’Connell has the “unsettling” realisation that “this scene had been carefully arranged by a visitor, probably quite recently, precisely in order for it to be photographed”. A guide’s job is to show you what you expect, just more so: a representation of reality that emphasises what you always believed. It rarely has much to do with the guide’s own life.As the literary critic Frank Kermode had it, the apocalypse is a fiction, one that lends humanity a “sense of an ending”. In his book of that name, Kermode argued that “crisis is a way of thinking about one’s moment, and not inherent in the moment itself”. Man arrives in the world in media res, and the apocalypse is a “coherent pattern” he follows to create “consonance” from the discord inherent in the inidual’s relationship to the world. (This is also why, when doomsday preppers get the date of the Rapture wrong, they always claim it was due to an interpretative or mathematical error – never because the myth is bunk.) We think about the world as a book, in other words, and “one of the great charms of books is that they have to end”, Kermode writes.The role of the critic is important here he must stand outside the paradigm to “make sense of the ways in which we try to make sense of our lives”. Near the beginning of his book, O’Connell half-jokingly poses that the apocalyptic fantasies he grew up with in the 1980s were superior to the slow, painful climate collapse facing us today. “Nuclear war … adhered to certain established narrative conventions,” he writes. “You had near misses, global panics … You had plot, was what you had: you had drama. And even more crucially, you had characters.” He goes on to suggest that a crucial difference between the cold war and global warming is that in the cold war, most people were “not among the protagonists and antagonists”, but “bystanders, whose role was limited to cowering in terror”. The trouble with the real apocalypse, he suggests, is that we are all authors of it.But this is a fiction, too – one that makes consonant our inidual feelings of power and agency within the overwhelming global system of capital in which we are each insignificant. It’s easily translated into the moral of The Lorax, which O’Connell relies on for his hopeful conclusion: “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not.” (Similarly, we would like to think decreasing carbon emissions is as simple as convincing enough people to stop travelling by plane.)It follows, then, that for much of the book, O’Connell doesn’t portray himself as a critic, or an author – he portrays himself as the protagonist of a novel. He can’t help but frame the story as a reluctant hero’s journey, a mid-life Bildungsroman. He notes that his usage of the word “pilgrimages” to describe his project is “weirdly religious, even self-aggrandising”, but nevertheless feels it’s too apt to abandon. “I was looking for something in these places, for some kind of enlightenment or edification or even solace.” As he peppers the text with explicit literary references, he also finds himself in situations that quietly imitate art: among others, there are parallels to fictions of Ben Lerner and László Krasznahorkai, whom Susan Sontag called the “master of the apocalypse”. Signs, symbols, explanations of those signs and symbols, and incredible coincidences abound, so often that I suspected O’Connell must have compressed, massaged, or otherwise altered what actually happened to fit the story he wanted to tell. At first, I wondered if his high-flown language was a wink at the gravity apocalypse inspires in people as the book went on, I had to admit he was mostly serious.In order to create the illusion of seamlessness between his experiences and his thoughts, he’s constantly “realising” things in scene, or else considering them, remembering them, being struck by them, or having them occur to him, though it seems likely he came up with them when reporting was done and he was toiling at his desk. I’m sceptical they just appeared in his mind while he was zoning out at the Heathrow Yo! Sushi. Perhaps these are intended as little apocalypses, to suggest that serious thinking can lead to a break or rupture in one’s life.But most damning is his treatment of other people, which reveals a more significant hypocrisy than claiming to care about the environment while still using an iPhone, the production of which destroys the world. Like his children, his subjects do not ever resemble real people but instead only ever serve some specific, singular purpose in the narrative. Thiel, for example, is “a figure of almost cartoonishly outsized villainy … a human emblem of the moral vortex at the centre of the market”. Most of the women in the book are the same stock character, a reserved sage nodding at O’Connell’s pointlessly spiralling thoughts as she goes on about her more important concerns: care work, sustaining life, “attention”.He introduces his wife as a woman of “unfathomable resilience and practical wisdom, to whom such fugue states of panic and epochal despair were essentially foreign” she forbids him from bringing thoughts of peripeteia into the home. On his wilderness retreat, a rugged Australian woman helps him set up his tent and avoids embarrassing him with “empathic skilfulness” by explaining that she used to work at a camping store. (He then explains why this is so empathic and skilful.) Even his prepper friend with the go-bag is a source of quietly eye-opening higher perspective: when he says he’d prefer to die in the apocalypse than to see what happens afterwards, she gently points out that women are “already halfway to a dystopia. If she got raped tomorrow, for instance, she was by no means confident that she would go to the cops about it.”In her 1965 essay “The Imagination of Disaster”, Sontag wrote that fantasy allows us to cope with life “under continual threat of two equally fearful, but seemingly opposed, destinies: unremitting banality and inconceivable terror”. When we fail to understand the relationship between fiction and reality, this coping mechanism stops working: all fictions become myths and prophesies. As we tear through history searching for some model to deal with pressing contemporary problems, “prescience” has emerged as the be-all and end-all of artistic accomplishment, inspiring in audiences almost quasi-religious admiration for “visionary” talents. (Kermode points out that the phrase “be-all and end-all” reflects a “pregnant conflation of crisis and an end immanent in it”. Shakespeare came up with it, in Macbeth.)“It’s just like Harry Potter, The Handmaid’s Tale, The Matrix, and Contagion!” social media users marvel when a news item resembles the plots of those stories. To treat these stories as prophesies is to miss the point of fictions completely. They’re supposed to be like life. By attempting to make the reverse true, to make reality fit into a fiction, O’Connell hasn’t really overcome his apocalyptic imagination. He has just passed it off to someone else.· Notes from an Apocalypse is published by Granta (RRP £14.99)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc49f3c0eedca30e1bd7daa9067a99d0a16b5465/0_29_5000_3002/master/5000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba9ba8fc62e021ff067b38dfd6d9ad6e","title":"the frightened ones by dima wannous review love and loneliness in syria","story":"This multilayered tale of revolution and displacement explores the psychological fallout from living under a brutal dictatorshipMidway through Dima Wannous’s novel, the narrator recalls a neighbour who fell sick during a dire shortage of doctors and medicine. The woman’s daughter had to take time off work to hunt for a hospital bed. “So, silently, I begged my own mother not to fall ill,” she says, to “not contract a virus or other disease.”As well as having a chilling resonance today, the anecdote offers a glimpse of daily life for millions of Syrians since the 2011 revolution. Almost five years after the uprising began, many doctors have left a country mired in civil war, where the price of medicines has sky-rocketed. Yet in Wannous’s ambitious, multilayered second novel – which was shortlisted for the 2018 International prize for Arabic fiction – the threat of disease is just one of many reasons to live in fear.The novel opens in a psychotherapist’s waiting room in Damascus where, years earlier, the narrator Suleima met her lover, Naseem. She is an artist with anorexia who has panic attacks, while Naseem, a doctor and writer, slaps his face compulsively. After the uprising begins, he leaves for Germany – a loss that compounds her grief over the deaths of men in her family. Naseem sends her a novel manuscript from his new country with a narrator, Salma, whose life closely resembles her own: “Naseem stole me and wrote me into his novel.” This manuscript’s first-person chapters alternate with Suleima’s.Fleeing to Beirut, Suleima returns periodically to her analyst Kamil’s couch in the Syrian capital. As she moves between “brutal” Damascus, with its checkpoints and Mukhabarat spies, and the “dark loneliness” of exile, the sources of the couple’s anxiety are revealed. Suleima ceased painting in 2012, when her brother disappeared after taking part in the protests. Naseem’s family was killed in the shelling of Homs. Being from that city is enough to get him detained in a hellishly overcrowded cell and beaten with a metal hose. Though his deepest fear is the sea, his only escape is via the Mediterranean.A complex tale of revolution, displacement, delusional love and the psychoanalyst’s couch, The Frightened Ones explores the psychological fallout from living under a brutal dictatorship in a bitterly riven society. It deploys dreams and Freudian interpretation in the context of a police state where torture is an instrument of control, and fear is anything but irrational. The name of the “eternal leader” Hafez al-Assad – whose 1970 coup founded the 50-year dynasty his son Bashir now heads – is first invoked by a madman urinating from a window on passers-by.The revolution and crackdown stir suppressed memories of one of the regime’s worst atrocities, the 1982 massacre that ended a Sunni uprising in Hama, which Suleima’s family fled. While her late father never spoke of it, her mother blamed him for cowardice. Fear, the novel suggests, can be both inherited and indoctrinated. Suleima recalls pressure at school to spout the party line on Hama (“Our Father the Leader has bloodied his hands for the whole Syrian people”), and being terrified by the instructor’s “cryptic smile”. As sectarian vitriol erupts, family rifts mirror fissures in the nation.Damascus-born Wannous, who studied French literature at the Sorbonne, can write powerfully and subtly. Yet the twin narratives (in distinct typefaces) are a sometimes confusing device. Suleima’s nuanced psychological interiority contrasts with Naseem’s crude glossing in his novel for a foreign readership – a difference well rendered in Elisabeth Jaquette’s translation. This contrast might hint at the dilemmas of writing from exile, and the violence done to women’s stories by men who purloin them. But the novel’s movement towards psychoanalytic resolution seems overcomplicated by its doppelganger theme (“Had I lost my memory and borrowed hers?” Suleima wonders). It is most memorable in surreal details and glancing tales: a woman sprawled on the pavement with a snorkel, “searching” for her drowned son an overprivileged student, whose father is an intelligence officer, who has his rival in love tortured and broken.The analyst Kamil emerges as the novel’s quiet hero – strangely reminiscent, to me at this time, of Dr Rieux in Camus’s The Plague. “Lines etched by exhaustion” on his face, he was “experiencing the same things we were: we the crushed, unnerved and frightened ones”. Humane and indefatigable, he remains in Damascus doing his job, treating the torturers and tortured alike who fill his waiting room, in a society yet to come to terms with its traumatic history. As Suleima imagines him saying: “Either we all stood together or we’d all lose our minds at once!”• The Frightened Ones by Dima Wannous, translated by Elisabeth Jaquette, is published by Harvill Secker."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae8fab2db91130d6e6f89366acf534b9cdf07119/0_428_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fc7d54f8018f75998a537e3356b8fbb","title":"imf has no experience of recession arriving with such ferocity","story":"Recovery will take some time as countries will exit Covid-19 lockdown only graduallyIn 1941, Britain considered its colony of Singapore to be pretty much impregnable. But while the naval base was bristling with big guns, its defences were geared towards preventing a sea-based invasion and when the attack came it was on land, down the Malay peninsula. Britain was expecting trouble, just not from that direction.The same fate has befallen the International Monetary Fund and the Office for Budget Responsibility, both of which have been forced to rip up their forecasts as a result of Covid-19. Both organisations knew there was potential for things to go wrong: they simply did not spot the likely cause.The fact that the Covid-19 pandemic spread so quickly meant countries had virtually no time to prepare. Nor had they any experience of a recession arriving with such sudden ferocity. A look back at past slumps shows that it normally takes 18 months to two years for output to fall from peak to trough. This time, both the International Monetary Find (IMF) and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) think the UK is already experiencing the worst of the slump and that, following a swift collapse, recovery will begin in the second half of 2020.The IMF is more cautious, and is pencilling in a more gradual recovery not just for the UK but for the global economy as a whole. It remains to be seen how gradual the process proves to be, and whether it is interrupted by a recurrence of the Covid-19 virus. The IMF is encouraged by the evidence that the lockdowns are helping contain the virus and thinks the extraordinary policy response from central banks will help limit the number of firms going bust and job losses.But it has sketched alternatives to its baseline forecast, which take into account extended lockdowns and a second outbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9b712943723f3840e23fb90f46c81c138ade41/0_208_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=670ee3aa5be11cede606d738ad6ccd3d","title":"whopper watchdog bans ads burger king vegan","story":"ASA says campaign implied burger did not contain beef or other animal productsAn ad campaign for Burger King’s first plant-based burger has been banned by the advertising watchdog for implying it is suitable for vegans and vegetarians, when it is not.The Rebel Whopper, which was launched in January coinciding with Veganuary, was promoted in a campaign that included tweets and Facebook posts.The ads, which trumpeted the patty as the fast food chain’s “first plant-based burger”, also featured the “Vegetarian Butcher” logo.However, the soy-based version of the chain’s Whopper beef burger is cooked on the same grill as meat and egg-based mayonnaise applied, making it unsuitable for many non-meat eaters.Burger King said the ads explained in the “small print” that the burger may not be suitable for vegans or vegetarians as it was cooked alongside meat products. The company said the Vegetarian Butcher logo was not used in TV advertising, acknowledging it could be potentially misleading. Customers could also ask for no mayonnaise, the company said.The ASA said the public would have assumed from the social media ads that the burger did not contain beef or other animal products. The use of the Vegetarian Butcher logo, a green colour palette and the timing of the launch during Veganuary contributed to the impression it was suitable for vegans and vegetarians.The ASA banned the ads for misleading consumers, saying the small print warning “was not sufficiently prominent to override the overall impression that the burger was suitable for vegetarians and vegans”.In addition, there was no warning about the presence of egg mayonnaise.“We concluded that the ads were misleading,” the ASA said. “The ads must not appear again in their current form.”Burger King has previously said it was targeting “flexitarians” – people who eat meat but are reducing their intake of animal products.At its launch, the burger was complimented by Toni Vernelli, the international head of communications and marketing at Veganuary, a campaign to encourage people to go meat, dairy and egg-free for the month of January.He said the method of cooking “makes absolutely no difference” to those trying to cut down on meat, but could encourage meat-eaters to lower their consumption.However, The Vegan Society said veganism was a plant-based diet that avoided all animal foods such as meat (including fish, shellfish and insects), dairy, eggs and honey.

Some hope the global economy will bounce back from Covid-19, but others expect a long, bumpy, haul.Newsflash: Global oil demand is expected to fall by a record amount this year -- according to industry experts.The International Energy Agency has predicted that demand will slump by 29 million barrels per day in April -- to levels last seen in 1995 -- as the Covid-19 lockdown hits demand extremely hard.It also warned that output cuts (such as last week’s Opec+ deal to remove 19.5m bpd) won’t offset this slump in demand.For 2020 as a whole, the IEA predicts demand will slump by 9.3m barrels per day. It also gives producers some credit for (finally) reaching last weekend’s agreement to cut output.“By lowering the peak of the supply overhang and flattening the curve of the build-up in stocks, they help a complex system absorb the worst of this crisis.“There is no feasible agreement that could cut supply by enough to offset such near-term demand losses.

China’s policymakers have acted overnight, by cutting a key medium-term interest rate to record lows and paving the way for a similar reduction in benchmark loan rates. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says investors are turning gloomier as the Covid-19 recession strikes.Under these circumstances, and with looming first quarter corporate earnings, recent gains we have seen in equity markets could be the calm before the storm. Investors could close their positions and run to safety in the blink of an eye. This explains why safe haven assets are curiously bid despite solid gains across global equities.In recent weeks, the markets had been cheered by hopes that the lockdowns could soon ease and people would return to the office, the shop and even the pub. But gradually, more investors are realising that the coronavirus will cause long-term economic damage too. “Most of the analysts are asking — ‘When will the economies return back to work?’ — which we believe is the wrong question,” said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of BK Asset Management, in a Tuesday note.“The much more relevant question is — ‘When will aggregate demand recover to pre-virus levels?’ That is a much more difficult dilemma to assess given the massive damage done to consumer balance sheets.” The IMF is publishing its Fiscal Monitor later today, looking at the state of government finances - as Covid-19 drives borrowing sharply higher. We’re also expecting to see a big drop in US retail sales, and a slump in factory output in the New York region.

These iding lines extend beyond the cabinet and the governing party, to become a new shorthand in an old culture war. The right wants to get back to business as usual the left wants a lockdown for as long as it takes.That is the wrong way to approach these decisions, which will entail constant and painful trade-offs. Conceptually, we find it easiest to focus on the things we can count. So we talk about stock markets, about businesses going bust and about unemployment as a cost to the exchequer – and the imperative to lift the lockdown thus becomes a purely economic one. And on the other hand, we talk about numbers infected, numbers of ventilators, numbers of dead. Yet behind all these numbers, there are people, whose physical and mental health are symbiotic: people to whose wellbeing the virus is not the only threat.Even while recessions are not historically associated with higher mortality, our recent experience of fiscal contraction and austerity was of huge numbers of excess deaths. There are impacts that aren’t yet visible but which we nevertheless cannot ignore Anne Case, co-author of Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism, pointed out recently that the negative effects of unemployment won’t show up for perhaps five years but have to be part of our consideration, even while this provides no obvious, definitive course of action.Likewise, isolation has its own health impact. People who were already suffering serious mental illness, or were already housebound with disabilities, have seen many of their support networks capsize overnight, which will create its own tragedies. People living in overcrowded conditions, without green space, will have a potentially devastating experience of self-isolation.You can’t even generalise across the category of “childhood” – an affluent kid in year 7 is just having a really long Easter holiday. A kid in year 11, ready for GCSEs, relying on free school meals, is facing something much starker. We were encouraged by Patel at the weekend to think of those living in abusive relationships, and perhaps stick a supportive logo, declaring “you are not alone”, in our windows. Our sympathetic thoughts are insufficient to the point of insult we need to think seriously about the hidden hardship this confinement entails, and it is humane to do so, not the act of some hard-boiled bread-head.None of this is an argument against the lockdown, or even for a shorter period of constraint. It is not at all clear when any of the restrictions could be lifted, or in which order. It is a fruitless discussion to have before we have greater clarity on testing, greater confidence that the antibody tests will work.Rather, it’s a plea for the subtlety and complexity of the question to be reflected in the way it is discussed. If we allow this to calcify into a debate between right and left, the plurality of views collapses into two as we all line up behind our team. Expertise is so often characterised by uncertainty, knowing enough to know that every decision contains pros and cons, consequences both foreseeable and not. Binary debates invite absolute views, and chase away the frustrating complexities of knowledge, in favour of arguments that can obliterate one another. It actually isn’t fair – and I never thought I’d feel so sympathetic to them – on the politicians of any party, to turn decisions so seismic into questions of loyalty to a pre-existing agenda.Meanwhile, there are many questions that plainly are political, which we’re asked by the government not to politicise. The provision of protective equipment to NHS and social care staff is not the unknowable conundrum that the health secretary pretends it is, with his intimations that staff are misusing it, and his airy talk of targets hoped for rather than targets met. There is an obvious duty on the state, if it’s asking people to risk their lives, to protect those people to the very limits of its ability.Likewise, the testing of NHS staff, of care workers, of bus drivers, of prison officers, of the wider population, this is all a matter for public debate. It is legitimate to interrogate policy every step of the way, and reasonable to point out hypocrisy or incompetence. It would be derelict not to scrutinise decisions around sick pay and other entitlements, income protection for those in insecure work. In the grim daily death toll, it is right to ask how the tragedy is being distributed, what can be done to address the disproportionate risk faced by those in low-paid work, why black and minority ethnic people comprise such a high number of the total, how to narrow these health inequalities in real time. A nation may come together in the face of an emergency, but it doesn’t need to switch its brain off.Yet the way forward, murky and obscure, is made no clearer by partisanship. If we build the strategy of the next phase well, it will be short on fireworks. There will be no grandstanding or rabble-rousing it will be hard to tell who’s on which team there will be a large variety of expert voices, making points subtle enough that to hear the differences between them, we’ll have to listen it will be conducted in pastels not neon. The pandemic appears to distill politics down to its barest essentials: do you care about money, or do you care about people? The only problem is, it doesn’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca349aa8d4765bc69f2f24ede88f8797e5e603f2/17_0_4729_2840/master/4729.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d82e6e88a803e936e19b8e186331af4","title":"coronavirus uk ireland delay","story":"In March, while the UK delayed, Ireland acted. For many this may prove to have been the difference between life and deathThe choices our governments have made in the last month have profoundly shaped what risks we, as citizens, are exposed to during the course of this pandemic. Those choices have, to a large extent, determined how many of us will die.At the time of writing, 365 people have died in Ireland of Covid-19 and 11,329 have died in the UK. Adjusted for population, there have been 7.4 deaths in Ireland for every 100,000 people. In the UK, there have been 17 deaths per 100,000. In other words, people are dying of coronavirus in the UK at more than twice the rate they are dying in Ireland. Yet, despite Ireland being your closest neighbour, this has barely been mentioned in the British press.In Ireland, we consume a great deal of British media. This means that we’ve been watching, with growing despair and grief, British news reports chronicling a national disaster. But for weeks now, long before the death rate accelerated, we’ve been watching and reading your reports with a queasy feeling. We knew of the measures and plans the Irish government was putting in place to protect us and we knew how far your government was slipping behind.When our taoiseach was closing our schools and universities, your prime minister was still telling you to wash your hands. When our government cancelled St Patrick’s Day celebrations, yours allowed the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead and, with it, a potentially massive multi-day super-spreading event of over 250,000 people. The contrast was disorientating.Nowhere was the dissonance more marked than on the weekend before St Patrick’s Day. By that point, Ireland had banned indoor gatherings of more than 100 people, but had stopped short of closing the pubs. A video showing revellers in Temple Bar went viral a public outcry ensued #closethepubs trended on Irish Twitter the minister for health commented and voluntary pub closures began the following morning.That same weekend, thousands attended a gig in Cardiff: I remember watching the video being posted on Twitter that Saturday night and feeling sick to my stomach. How many people were being infected, at that very moment, singing along to the Stereophonics? I say this not to shame the band their decision to go ahead with the gig was informed by government guidelines. But while their gig was permitted in the UK, it would have been banned in Ireland. I assume there were people in Cardiff who felt the same way I did. The difference was that I was supported by my government. They weren’t.Pandemics grow exponentially, so that infections seem to rise slowly, and then all at once. Every day counts. A week’s delay in mid-March would yield an outsized effect on the deaths to come in April. This means that the contrasting choices of the UK and Irish governments in March mattered.Technically, the UK went into lockdown before Ireland, on 23 March, but Ireland was already operating a “delay phase” from 12 to 27 March. I would argue that the crucial difference in approach lies in this two-week period from 9 March, when Ireland cancelled St Patrick’s Day, to 23 March, when the UK government finally initiated a lockdown. Because the Irish government moved quickly, we seem to have interrupted our pandemic’s exponential curve at an earlier point. In mid-March, our models forecast 3,000 new coronavirus cases a day by the end of the month. In reality, we had a daily increase of less than 300, one-tenth of that predicted. Our government’s measures worked.It’s probably too early to know for sure whether the UK government’s delays, set against the Irish government’s action, made a decisive difference. However, we do know that people in the UK are currently dying more than twice as fast as their neighbours across the Irish Sea. Ireland has also been testing for the coronavirus at twice the rate of the UK (at least). Given that the UK Department of Health’s daily statistics only include deaths in hospitals where there has been a positive coronavirus test, your lack of testing is probably depressing your figures. More importantly, the daily death toll released by the Irish government includes deaths in nursing homes and the community, whereas the UK daily releases do not. EU figures suggest that half of all deaths may take place in care homes, and their exclusion from the daily UK figures is puzzling. If we adjust the Irish figures so that they match the UK criteria, and include only deaths in hospitals, the differences between us are even more stark. In that calculation, almost three and a half times as many people have died of the coronavirus in the UK as in Ireland.The best time to plant an oak tree was 20 years ago the second-best time is now. The best time to stop this pandemic was in January. The second-best time is now. And while we’re working this ground together, it would be good to remember that over the fence, in the neighbouring allotment, Ireland is tackling some of the same problems as the UK. It might be worth taking a peek over the fence sometimes, to see what we can share.• Elaine Doyle is a writer and researcher "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/542613dca2c0b4b194ee260a7205d52b86ddbb8a/1565_62_2111_1268/master/2111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3beb443fda6668b9d32ad6eaba139523","title":"eamonn holmes 5g coronavirus","story":"Viewers who thought they heard the ITV idol link coronavirus to 5G masts can breathe easy: it was they who got it wrong“Just before we go on,” said a desperate-to-go-on Eamonn Holmes at the start of today’s edition of This Morning, “I want to clarify some comments that some of you may have misinterpreted from me yesterday morning …” Classy of Eamonn to blame the viewers, but I’m afraid the mistake – suggesting that a link between 5G rollout and coronavirus ought to be considered – was all his, and this quarter-arsed “clarification” is faintly insufficient in the circumstances. Though arguably the biggest Holmes triumph since he concluded an interview with a rape victim with the words: “I hope you take taxis now.”By way of a recap, this conspiracy theory is seeing real-world impact on emergency communications when they are most needed. At last count at least 30 phone towers had been attacked. The figure has since grown.But who was this heaving into view on Monday morning, with a lofty big-picture take? Why, it was television’s Eamonn Holmes, whose recent (sadly unsuccessful) case against HMRC included himself’s assertion that he is “the best live presenter in the country”, and “not there to follow other people’s rules”. Not even the rules of physics, on this latest evidence.Or as Eamonn bullishly interrupted when This Morning’s consumer correspondent, Alice Beer, was explaining that the rumour was not true: “What I don’t accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don’t know it’s not true.” Two immediate things jump out there. First and foremost, that we do know it’s not true, as any number of simple and vitally important debunkings have shown. The second eyebrow-raiser is Eamonn’s apparent conviction that a man sitting on the This Morning sofa is not “the mainstream media”, but instead part of some plucky samizdat enterprise where you only hear the good shit. “It is very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative,” continued the Václav Havel of daytime interviews with body language experts. “That’s all I would say, as someone with an inquiring mind.”Mmm. Yet again, the question is what Eamonn might have made of himself if only he hadn’t been held back by such chronic self-doubt. As his autobiography remarks of the two men who gave him his first local TV gig: “I can only hope that TV history judges them as men of vision.”While we’re waiting for the judgment of televisual history, it feels like as good a moment as any to mention that 15 hours after Eamonn’s 5G brain-dump, police and six fire engines were called to a mobile phone mast in Huddersfield. Although it’s not yet known what caused the fire, it not only destroyed emergency services kit, but also posed a threat to occupants of the nearby block flats.Inevitably, people who don’t understand free speech are defending Eamonn. But as Oliver Wendell Holmes (not thought to be a relation) famously remarked, you don’t get to shout fire in a crowded theatre. Furthermore, I think we can all live without a defective free-speech defence of a man who once sent a legal letter to the BBC over a recurring Jon Culshaw impression that saw “Eamonn” given to eating everything in sight, from the programme sofa to studio guest Frankie Dettori. As the punchline ran: “I was fierce hungry, so I was.”Back in the present, ITV is declining to comment. But it was only a fortnight ago that Amanda Holden was also pushing a petition based on the 5G conspiracy (her agent later claimed she’d done so by accident). Given two of its highest profile presenters have now been associated with this arrant rubbish, is ITV going to do any better than allowing Eamonn to blame the viewers?Surely the most elegant – and indeed watchable – solution to it all would be to make Eamonn go on that most sacred of ITV broadcasting devices: a journey. As far as what our hero might discover about himself on this quest, I imagine it would be something similar to what Ron Atkinson learned in the supposedly penitential (BBC) documentary Big Ron: Am I a Racist?The answer to that inquiry, given that Ron had recently been overheard describing a player as “a fucking lazy thick n*****”, was patently obvious: yes. Yes, you are. And I imagine we’d arrive at a similar answer for a programme with the working title: Eamonn Holmes: Am I a Tax-Avoiding Irritant So Inflated By Self-Regard That I’ve Actually Gone and Fanned a Lunatic Conspiracy Theory That is Literally Hampering Emergency Communications Right Now, in the Middle of a Fricking Pandemic?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afa4bbe3b638200bdc77052aafb826290648dcd7/0_217_5578_3347/master/5578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49eb38040e1ddf14664ad0b110105973","title":"why is cottagecore booming because being outside is now the ultimate taboo","story":"The visual and lifestyle movement is designed to fetishise the wholesome purity of the outdoorsYouth movements are always about more than what meets the eye. For example, 1970s first-wave punk wasn’t really just about punk music. Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols defined the punk world’s position on harmonics as such: “We’re into chaos, not music.” But it’s not just the appeal of an ideology that sparks a new youth subculture. The most memorable feed off a taboo of the times. In the case of early punk, if the world was tipping toward Thatcher-era conservatism, maybe it was time to put a safety pin in your face and get in the pit.As expected, there’s a new taboo on the scene, ripe for fetishization. What’s not expected though, is the taboo itself: “The Outside World”. Today, the simple act of being outdoors poses a very real, very mortal threat. So while mindlessly scrolling through Twitter, and encountering collages of young women lying in grass, cradling bunnies, wearing outfits out of Picnic at Hanging Rock – I felt as though I’d found something as illicit as a schedule 2 drug.The reference here is cottagecore: a visual and lifestyle movement designed to fetishize the wholesome purity of the outdoors, spearheaded by lovely queer teens of TikTok. Gaining initial traction sometime around 2018, its founders imagined and discussed idyllic escape from the endless dopamine trap of digital media and the brutal judgment that accompanied it.In contrast to the choker-donning eGirl, those worshipping at the church of cottagecore wear traditional, Victorian-inspired dresses – a wholesale dismissal of cyber-inspired everything. Well, not everything – Nintendo’s latest, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, fits perfectly within the calming, pastoral universe imagined by cottagecore devotees.It’s well-established that most contemporary movements are dependent on social media for growth. So it’s funny that cottagecore is both dependent on it, and simultaneously ignores its existence. It’s easy to understand why. Millennials were the first generation to grow up with the internet, yet Gen Z has led the entirety of their adolescence in a state of constant social media performance. It makes sense that on a foundational level, cottagecore would tap into a taboo familiar to many teens and young adults: To be “disconnected”. To be “unavailable”. To be “off-the-grid”. In 2018, “to be outdoors” was a symbolic act of rebellion. Fast-forward to 2020, and the outdoors are a pipe dream (featuring pink baby lambs, of course).Gardening, interacting with farm animals, and dancing with a loved one under the moonlight. These classic cottagecore themes eschew digital connectedness in favor of a connectedness to nature. But this isn’t anything new: the movement’s aesthetics are part of a larger visual tradition that peaks in cycles when urban grit, industrialization and the drudgery of daily life demand escape.In 1854, David Henry Thoreau published Walden, a response to the rapid industrialization he witnessed during his lifetime. In the 1860s, the avant-garde art movement known as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood romanticized nature in firm opposition to the utilitarian ethos of industrialized Europe. Art Nouveau and the Arts and Crafts Movement of the 1880s quickly followed in a further attempt to highlight a human touch when machines continued to replace man.It was assumed that because we’re living in socially distanced, Zoom-mediated reality, our visual tastes might follow suit. Maybe the increasingly outdated Millennial Aesthetic of the 2010s (frosted pink, potted fig trees, sparkling terrazzo) would give way to something hyper-digital – referencing the synthetic-ness of a life spent online. But to hold up a mirror to our current situation would be too simple. Perhaps the more apt reference is a window into a rarified reality. We revere what we can’t have, and today that looks a lot like what cottagecore celebrates: a taste of nature, the human hand and an aesthetic that soothes us to our very core. Visual ASMR, anyone? Perhaps we could do with some baby lambs right about now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8f381ae487fcd6e266ef70b5f502cd08b546c06/0_274_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=023320d1094b717f423fccb7c7ef5be1","title":"michael sheen mocks itv announcer over martin mix up","story":"Welsh actor changes his name on Twitter to that of the Hollywood starMichael Sheen has mocked an ITV continuity announcer for mixing him up with his fellow actor Martin Sheen by switching his name on Twitter to that of the Hollywood star.The blunder apparently happened when the channel introduced the second instalment on Tuesday of its new mini-series, Quiz, in which the Welsh actor plays the presenter Chris Tarrant.After switching his Twitter name to that of the star of Apocalypse Now and The West Wing, Sheen tweeted: “Hey ITV the least you can do is get my name right in your trailers FFS.”Sheen has carved out a successful TV and film career giving impressively accurate portrayals of real-life people, including Kenneth Williams in Fantabulosa, football manager Brian Clough in The Damned United, David Frost in FrostNixon, and former prime minister Tony Blair twice, in The Deal and The Queen.The writer Caitlin Moran wrote: “ITV announced him as ‘Martin Sheen’.

I’ve got a routine going. Bizarrely, I’ve been more relaxed about my OCD when it comes to micromanaging my time because it’s taken out of my hands.With previous records I relied on going on a journey for inspiration. The physical limitations have stumped my creativity a little bit. Every time I tried to write about this period – I’ve given up now – it all just sounded so meh. Maybe I need to give it some time. I’m in a fortunate position because I’ve got half a record written. If isolation had arrived a month into writing, it might have had a bigger effect. My last record is all primary colours and sunshine. This next record is a little earthier.On my last record, there were lots of songs about escaping and dreaming. What I was forced to learn, in my own life, is that when things arrive, I’m better off confronting them. I feel in limbo between being a boy and a man. It’s interesting to be in a transitional period where it’s almost as if I can see either side of the tightrope. Those questions are coming up in the songs: who am I, why am I, what am I to do?I remember writing sixth-form poetry and trying to force myself to confront things like that, but it never felt natural. Whereas now, it seems like a good use of my time to be thinking about them and not expecting to come out the other side with a eureka moment.I make physical structures, but now the question is, can you make it digitally? So much of what I was doing was an assault against the glowing portal of your phone or computer. Suddenly I’m not discouraging my children, I’m not taking their phone off them, because it’s now the window to culture, to friendship, to everything.Before all this happened I was working on a maze based on the structure of a human lung, which looks like the branches of a tree. I did a piece in 2016 called Mirror Maze in a warehouse in Peckham. My thought was to make a piece like that where people arrive in groups of 12, they watch a film and then walk through it, into a maze made of mirror. At the end you look across a sea of water and see reflections of yourself with these bifurcating patterns projected on to you, so you begin to understand that these tree-like structures are inside us as well as defining the way we move. We’re in a holding pattern now about when it can be physically realised. People won’t have the confidence to visit these works – or any of the other collective audience works that I make – until there’s a coronavirus vaccine.In many ways we needed this: look at the way we can operate without getting on a plane, the way we can spend time with our kids … I’ve never recently spent so many days in one place. It’s a calibration between how long, how different and the casualties along the way.When you tune into the larger vibration of what’s going on it’s hard not to make work that responds to that. That’s the work we need to make.Until the middle of last month, I was in Los Angeles preparing my new film. There was no “stay in place” there then, but people were afraid. Our hotel was almost empty and, one day, I realised they were no longer serving breakfast, only coffee, and that the people must be out of a job. That frightened me.When I came home, there was a panic over whether there would be enough intensive care beds, but in fact the French healthcare system is not the worst. I live next to a hospital and they did manage to take everyone. Yet there was some shock here to realise that being lucky in our infrastructure is not the same as being prepared. We were late with that. And there will be a huge crisis after this immediate crisis. When I go out to buy bread, I see shops that may never open again.I hope France’s socialist history has given us a degree of philosophical preparedness. After the second world war, laws were enacted to help the country rebuild its healthcare and education and unemployment. We were less concerned about returning to industry and more about giving social dignity to the people. To be poor or out of work is not something shameful here. Likewise in Greece, where fewer people are sick.At the moment, I’m doing a lot of reading, working on the film I still hope will shoot in the autumn, and watching old movies. Last week I saw a lot of Shohei Imamura just now it was the Belmondo film L’Homme de Rio, which I find so charming. What I see is random –\u0026nbspthese aren’t decisions about how to help survive.But I’m not drawn to fiction about comparable situations. I want to live in the present: to have food and a roof over my head and to know my family is OK. To write about what we are going through now without knowing the consequences isn’t something that interests me. It would be stupid.Outside might look like a sci-fi film from my window, but that’s not the whole world. They may suffer more I don’t know. I’m not ready to think about it.While house concerts, live streams and archival footage are now readily available for free online, this period has confronted the classical music industry with some profound existential questions: what does it mean to have an onlinevirtual self versus a real self? Can music and video be combined to create something that is completely new and relevant for our time? What takes the online self beyond the realm of mere self-promotion? Can we work with video artists and web designers to explore the texture of the digital being? What effect will it have on the way we monetise our profession if everything is now expected to be free? Are we so accustomed to the state of being in a late-capitalist society that the notion of silence and stillness is alien to us? What meaning does music have in this world?As a performer I’ve had concerts cancelled, but as a composer I’ve luckily not been directly affected yet. These last few days I’ve been commissioned to write a short piece for violin and piano for Elena Urioste and Tom Poster to perform online – the couple are posting daily performances on Twitter #UriPosteJukebox. Does it describe these strange times we’re living in? Not directly, but it has a kind of yearning quality, and an ambiguous harmony that alludes to our current mood. I never think that my music directly responds to world events, but subconsciously, naturally, it’s in there. I’m also writing a violin concerto for Nicola Benedetti – commissioned some months ago, but as I write it now I find a sense of claustrophobia and anxiety has crept into some of the material. I want to find a way to try and express that shared feeling of anxiety with a look toward a more hopeful future.I live 100 miles from New York City, and life in a small town is very different during this period. There’s a small city near me called Hudson. On nice days I go there and photograph – I can walk down the street and not get within 100 feet of another person. So my photographic activity hasn’t changed much. But the work is recontextualised. I recently posted pictures of the first signs of spring. They’re very much like what I posted this time last year, but I’m getting comments about how they symbolise rebirth and hopefulness. They’re reminding people that life goes on, that certain things have their own time clocks and cycles.I’ve done some indoor photography myself – one wearing gloves, another where I’m using hand sanitiser. I’ve started a series of posts about what I’m watching on television because I’m doing more of that now. But I’m not sure I’ve learned anything in particular from this period. My approach remains the same as it was in 1972, when I would travel the country, see a meal in front of me and think, “This is what I’m looking at”. Now it’s hand sanitiser. But I’m still just paying attention to what I’m looking at and seeing it as a possibility for a picture.In spite of the lockdown, the TV industry can still partially function: producers, directors and writers continue to develop new projects from their kitchens, while post-production can largely be done remotely.When it comes to filming new content though, everything has halted. In my case, that’s meant suspending pre-production on a new ITV show, only a few weeks before filming was due to begin.TV productions are big operations with hundreds of people on the payroll – all freelance – so worryingly most won’t receive government grants until June. We’ve managed to furlough as many crew as possible, but others have been given two weeks notice.Shutting a production down is expensive, and many companies will have to absorb the losses. The financial implications will reverberate throughout the next few years: how many people we can employ how many scripts we can commission. But TV is a robust industry, it’ll bounce back.When things pick up again productions will start all at once, so it’ll prove almost impossible to get previously assembled crews back together. That’s a practical worry for someone doing a job like mine, but it should create a vital flurry of work for thousands of people.Quite how all this informs what gets commissioned remains to be seen, but what audiences want to watch in a post-Covid world might well be different. In the meantime, social distancing lets us go back and watch what we missed the first time: shows that we loved can be watched again, and those that weren’t may get a fresh hearing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4852ef4a5e05165cd4a3c770b34e678f454ebf5/66_0_2388_1434/master/2388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8968bc8939c814e574d9a170379609ca","title":"like a spiral ufo worlds longest animal discovered in australian waters","story":"Along with up to 30 new marine species, scientists have found a 150-ft example of a siphonophore, a string-like deep-sea predatorScientists exploring the deep sea off Australia’s coast have discovered as many as 30 new marine species – and what may be the longest animal ever seen.The discoveries were the result of expeditions into Western Australia’s underwater canyons. One of the biggest discoveries was a siphonophore measuring an estimated 150 feet (46 metres). Siphonophores are deep-sea predators made up of many small clones that act together as one and spread out like a single long string in the water. Researchers think this particular siphonophore may be the longest yet found.The expedition also collected a number of other deep-sea animals that the researchers suspected had not yet been documented, including an octopus squid, a long-tailed sea cucumber, glass sponges and the first giant hydroids – a colony of animals that looks like an upside-down jellyfish – ever seen in Australia.Nerida Wilson, a senior research scientist at the Western Australia Museum, who led the expedition, said the discovery of the extra-long siphonophore came when many researchers on board were least expecting it. The research vehicle dove as deep as 4,439 metres, but the siphonophore was only discovered as the vehicle was making its way back to the surface at around 630 metres.“Most scientists had drifted out of the control room,” Wilson said. “The word soon spread and people came pouring into the control room to share the excitement. It was just amazing to see this huge organism spread out like a spiral UFO, hovering in the water column. We couldn’t believe what we were seeing.”Siphonophores, like jellyfish, feed by dangling stinging tentacles in the water. Small crustaceans and fish unlucky enough to swim into this curtain of tentacles are paralyzed and reeled up to the body of the colony.The new siphonophore was about twice as long as many blue whales, and three times as long as a humpback whale, which usually grow to around 50ft long.The expedition was led by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, a non-profit group that supports oceanographic research, including the provision of a research vessel and remotely operated vehicle, which the Australian government and scientific institutions otherwise lack.The discovery of the siphonophore and other possibly unknown species was made in a protected area known as the Gascoyne Coast bioregion. This highlights what Wilson described as “one of the disconnects between where we are with ocean conservation and knowledge”.“While it’s a protected area, we actually have no idea what lives there,” she said. “We really wanted to reveal the incredible bioersity that is there.”Wilson acknowledged it will be months or years before researchers will be sure that the organisms they discovered are new to science. “We were definitely looking for and expecting new species,” she said. “Those waters were just too unexplored to not yield such treasures.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e31352ddcbca0262cc2659c4dcdb5da0558c9812/0_11_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c711200caa3987ddc7d51835dcf9173","title":"self isolating animals species social distancing wwf","story":"WWF has compiled a list of animal species whose social behaviours make them self-isolation experts.

On her head the singer sported a braided hairstyle with baby-hair edges. The hiic Gomez also appeared to have a darker complexion than she would normally have. “She is done letting people control her narrative,” the magazine wrote in the caption below. And yet the cover image styling appeared to show the singer appropriating from another culture completely. “This is blackfishing y’all wake up,” read one comment under the cover image, while the website Pop Crave tweeted the question: “Why is Selena Gomez trying to be black …” – featuring pictures from the Interview shoot.From the rapper Bhad Bhabie, who appeared on Instagram last week deeply tanned and in a black wig, to the styling of Ariana Grande in her 7 Rings video (she had worn “culture as a costume” according to the Atlantic), “blackfishing” has become an all too familiar cultural trope. The term was coined to reflect a perception that you are cosmetically enhancing your appearance through makeup and hairstyles to appear as if you have black heritage. “It’s about picking and choosing common black traits and characteristics for one’s benefit,” explains Johanna Yaovi, the founder of The Curl Talk Project, “while we continue to face discrimination on a day to day basis. “As black women, we are constantly fighting for clear, authentic representation and ersity and then have to face iniduals who do blackfishing, iniduals who will therefore look ambiguous enough for brands to use them as emblems for ersity.”Last month Kim Kardashian, a figure who some commentators have accused of normalising blackfishing, was called out for wearing braids at Paris fashion week with Twitter users asking: “Can you please stop appropriating black culture?” In December, Kardashian drew criticism for her appearance on the cover of 7Hollywood magazine, which saw her sporting a Diana Ross-like wig, dress and a darker complexion. Karen Attiah, the Washington Post’s global opinions editor, tweeted: “I don’t see it as complicated. Her proximity to and appropriation of blackness has gotten her (and her family) paid. Handsomely.” (Kim and Khloé Kardashian have a combined net worth of $400m, while their younger sister Kylie Jenner has been named by Forbes the youngest billionaire in the world). “It’s America’s obsession with blackness, and black culture – without black people,” she added.In November, Love Island’s Molly Mae Hague was questioned after using a foundation that was many shades darker than her natural skin tone. Many Twitter users found it troubling that she was turning her skin into a darker shade than it was naturally, comparing her to Rachel Dolezal.“I do question the motivation behind some people’s excessive use of tanner,” says the journalist Wanna Thompson. “Do I believe that every person who tans wants to be black? Not particularly, but I do wonder about the need to make yourself appear several shades darker. Who are you trying to emulate?” Thompson came up with the term “blackfishing” when she saw a discussion about white women cosplaying as black women on Twitter. “And I said to myself, ‘I need to bring awareness to this growing issue’. “It’s always been prevalent,” Thompson says. “Be it fashion, beauty or music. Black is cool, unless you’re actually black.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a07ec1cabbf9536db8666d9ddf1d9608ac762351/0_247_3901_2341/master/3901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbf78185ce523ecfae5df2f11d2ecbbb","title":"jane horrocks wearing a tight latex dress felt brave and liberating","story":"The actor on how Absolutely Fabulous led her to modelling for sustainable label Vin + Omi, and how her children helped her to reinvent her style When Vin + Omi first asked me to model, it was at a time when I was trying to do things that I had not done before and not be so much on repeat.

A sale to a consortium fronted by the Yorkshire-born financier Amanda Staveley has been broadly agreed and documents lodged at Companies House last week provide concrete proof that advanced negotiations are well under way.The paperwork suggests the proposed £310m deal involves Ashley apparently loaning Staveley’s company PCP Capital Partners £150m in an attempt to get an agreement over the line. It is understood that in reality Staveley is taking on a £110m interest-free loan the retail tycoon had made to Newcastle but the club will be purchased outright.This complicated transaction is reflected in Companies House papers which create a legal scaffolding enabling the ownership handover to proceed through a transfer of shares.Three years ago Newcastle’s owner called Staveley “a time waster” after the collapse of an attempt to purchase the club but the new documents confirm she and Ashley have agreed a £13m deposit.Puzzlingly, and perhaps significantly, the Saudi investment is not mentioned in the Companies House documents made public on Tuesday, although Reuben Brothers’ involvement is detailed. However it is understood PIF, whose role is likely to be the subject of not merely Premier League but government interest amid sports–washing and human rights concerns, remains part of the consortium. It is believed PIF intends to help fund urban regeneration on Tyneside.Ashley bought Newcastle for £133m in 2007 but his willingness to transfer his subsequent £110m loan to Staveley to facilitate a sale was confirmed in a “registration of a charge” at Companies House. A charge is the security a company gives for a loan.Newcastle’s owner has long been known for driving the hardest of bargains but the coronavirus crisis has been extremely bad news for his retail empire and he now seems keen to offload Newcastle. The club declined to comment on the latest developments.The Premier League has received the necessary paperwork from both parties and is understood to be initiating the mandatory owners and directors test. The sale is contingent on both the governing body’s blessing and the finalising of the deal’s small print.Given the logistical difficulties imposed by the current lockdown the Premier League test process could take up to a month to complete. When, and if a satisfactory conclusion is reached – and providing Ashley does not change his mind – then Yasir al-Ramayyan, the governor of PIF, is expected to become Newcastle chairman. There could also be a seat on the board for Jamie Reuben, the 32-year-old son of David Reuben, although he would first need to resign his current directorship of QPR."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/982d01296ead4fdc314eadd9c30bf49739afc396/0_128_5168_3102/master/5168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f188bf34d408d3342cf52c8262d2b2f","title":"deep inequalities of social distancing in south africa in pictures coronavirus","story":"In densely populated townships and cities, the army and police have been patrolling the streets to enforce strict measures to curb the spread of coronavirusAll photographs by Jérôme Delay for AP"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eccb154fa2ca2fedc153092443baf21df18684c/90_68_4125_2475/master/4125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=605554917908fa309d0a561c07e59051","title":"daily telegraph stops publishing section paid for by china","story":"Content from China Watch, written by state journalists, has also been wiped from websiteThe Daily  has stopped publishing paid-for propaganda on behalf of Chinese state media, amid growing scrutiny of how Beijing is using the pandemic to grow its influence in English-language media aimed at western audiences.The long-running China Watch section, funded by the government-controlled China Daily news outlet, has appeared in the  for more than a decade.

The Washington Post has also run China Watch in the past, although the outlet confirmed they have not run the supplement since last year.They are the same three US news outlets that recently had their Chinese-based reporters expelled from the country.Similar deals to reprint paid-for Chinese propaganda have been struck with newspapers around the world, including outlets in Australia, France and Germany."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb04114fe4a9443e2a7f3abc4fa79bfc039eb29/94_90_2966_1780/master/2966.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a61eae18c2cb1d0c3c0521f016044d5","title":"why have the uk and germany taken different approaches to covid 19 testing","story":"In February, the UK and Germany were taking a similar approach to testing for coronavirus.

Price said: I have lodged a formal complaint to the European commission relating to instructions reportedly issued by Public Health England to the main domestic suppliers of PPE in the UK not to sell certain high-demand items to care homes outside of England.Price claimed this potentially breached EU regulations and added: I have been made aware of countless cases of care home workers being left to work with wholly inadequate PPE, endangering themselves and those they care for.This really is a matter of life and death and the Welsh and UK governments must get to grips with the problems surrounding the supply and distribution of PPE as a matter of urgency whilst doing so in a manner which doesn’t discriminate any nation in any way.Downing Street denies that the NHS in England is being prioritised over the other nations.The husband of a former MP has died from Covid-19 in hospital after twice being told that he did not have the virus. Betty Williams said her husband Evan Williams, 79, died in intensive care on Good Friday – a day after a third test showed he had contracted the disease. He had initially been taken to a general ward a fortnight ago where he was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, before falling seriously ill and being placed on a ventilator. What worries me most about this is if the first two tests were negative, and the last test – the day before he died – was positive, he has either picked up the virus at Ysbyty Gwynedd or he had it when he went into hospital.If he took it in with him I’m really worried that he passed it on to other staff and patients.The Welsh government has apologised for sending letters warning the most vulnerable people to stay at home to the wrong addresses.It said that some shielding letters had been sent to previous addresses because of a processing error.

All letters have since been reissued to the correct addresses.We provided all local authorities with the correct details from the start of this process, and they have been directly contacting each person involved over the past two weeks.The spokesperson said supermarkets had also received the correct addresses and have been using these to prioritise delivery slots for people who are shielding.“We fully understand the concern this would have caused people and sincerely apologise for the mistake,” the spokesperson added.The government has not so far said how many letters were sent to the wrong addresses. The BBC has reported that it was 13,000. Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Frances Perraudin.We have already covered what Helen Whately, the care minister, said in interviews on Sky News and BBC Breakfast (see 7.57am), but Whately had a tougher time when questioned by Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain. One of the issues on which they clashed was over the number of NHS workers who have died from coronavirus. Whately insisted the official figure was still 19. She said:The data that has been reported to me of confirmed deaths of health workers is 19. We know that also some workers have died who work in social care and, I’ll be straight with you, we don’t have a figure for that.Morgan said that was “complete nonsense”, saying that newspapers have identified at least 38 NHS workers who have died with Covid-19.The Nursing Notes website has been keeping a tally in memory of health and social care workers who have died with coronavirus, and this morning it lists a total of 51. The row over PPE manufacturers allegedly prioritising England over Scotland and Wales, which we reported on here, rumbles on this morning with the Scottish health secretary calling on her UK counterpart to resolve the “contradiction” between his assurances and the response from equipment manufacturers.Overnight, the head of umbrella body Scottish Care, Donald Macaskill, has stood by his claims that firms have told his members that they cannot supply to Scotland because they are prioritising NHS England, with one company in particular suggesting that it had been instructed to do so by Public Health England.The owner of this firm, Gompels Healthcare, based in Wiltshire, gave an interview to the Courier in which he explained that the PPE in question had come from Public Health England’s own stocks which were stockpiled in case of a flu pandemic, arguing that given it was supplied by a body with no jurisdiction over any part of the UK other than England, it was right the equipment should remain there. Sam Gompels said: The fact is Public Health England got their finger out and organised these distribution channels and are getting pilloried for it because public health Scotland, or whatever the equivalent is, have not necessarily organised the same and that’s probably the nub of it.This morning on BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland, the Scottish health secretary, Jeane Freeman, insisted that her government had organised equivalent supply chains, widening the scope of the normal procurement organisation National Services Scotland early on. She said:That was to recognise the fact that the normal PPE ordering of the care home sector might not be sufficient in a pandemic … I am now looking at a contradiction between what a company says and the assurance the secretary of state has given me and I have simply asked him to resolve that because it sits at his hand.The new shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, has written to the government raising questions about the pace and scale of its prisoner release plans. It was announced earlier this month that as many as 4,000 inmates in England and Wales were to be temporarily released from jail in an effort to try and control the spread of coronavirus. In a letter to the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, seen by the , Lammy raised concerns that the number of prisoners released would be a “fraction” of the potential 4,000 eligible. The justice committee on Tuesday heard a “few hundred” prisoners would be released on Wednesday, although only four had been released since the decision to release inmates was announced on 4 April. Lucy Frazer, the justice minister, told MPs it took time to process the risk assessments required before the early release of prisoners.It is no exaggeration to say that the challenges you are facing as the secretary of state for justice during the Covid-19 outbreak are matters of life and death.The shadow justice secretary raised further questions about the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) sent to prison staff, as well as additional measures to reduce overcrowding after the government announced it would build 500 temporary cells on the existing prison estate. He also raised the question of testing within the prison estate. On Tuesday, the justice committee heard 700 prison staff had been tested for coronavirus and this was expected to be ramped up in the weeks ahead.On the subject of lifting the lockdown, this graphic looks at the plans in place across Europe, alongside the IMF’s dire economic forecasts.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has been speaking to ITV’s This Morning. He’ll be on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme shortly. He told ITV that people needed to be shown “light at the end of the tunnel” over the coronavirus outbreak.It’s obvious that the lockdown is going to continue and we are going to support the government in that. But, I do think, the question therefore is what comes next?People are trusting the government ... but they do need to see light at the end of the tunnel. I’m not asking the government for timings, of course, I understand why they can’t give us timings. But we do need the trust of the public as we go forward.Starmer added: “It is clear to me that mistakes have been made and things haven’t been done as quickly as they should. I’m challenging the government today to make sure we don’t make those mistakes again.”Police were called to 1,008 reports of people having house parties and gatherings in Greater Manchester over the Easter weekend, despite current lockdown guidance, Amy Walker reports. Many involved people from more than one household having barbecues in back gardens during warm weather.Greater Manchester police (GMP) told the Manchester Evening News they were called to 222 reports on Friday, 309 on Saturday, 386 on Sunday and a further 91 on Monday. Ian Hopkins, GMP’s chief constable, told the newspaper: People have lost their loved ones. Families are losing people too early when they shouldn’t be. Listening to some of the reports about what it’s like to lose someone and you can’t be with them, it’s heart-breaking.I just think people who think it’s OK to flout the regulations should just think about those families, and think about future families who will lose loved ones if this virus continues to spread in the way that it has been.The force repeatedly urged the public not to flout the rules over the bank holiday after they responded to more than 500 parties between March 25 and April 7, including some with DJs, bouncy castles and fireworks. Helen Whately, the minister for care, has been speaking to Sky News. She said that more than 1,000 care workers had already been tested for coronavirus and more than 2,000 had been referred for tests. This contradicts what shadow care minister Liz Kendall said last night, that only 500 care staff had been tested to date. Whately said:The testing is in progress. Over the next few days the Care Quality Commission is going to be phoning up nearly 30,000 care providers in order to identify who they need testing and start lining up people for tests.We have been doing everything that we can to protect those really vulnerable people living in care homes or receiving care at home.From the moment it looked like coronavirus was coming our way... we have been working really hard to do whatever we can to protect those receiving care from this truly awful, horrible illness.You can read the full story here –In a government announcement made overnight they have pledged that all care home residents and social care staff with Covid-19 symptoms will be tested for the virus as capacity increases.Health secretary Matt Hancock said he was determined to ensure that everyone needing a test should have access to one, with testing remaining a key part of the government’s coronavirus battle plan.Currently, only the first five symptomatic residents in a care home setting are tested to provide confirmation of whether there is an outbreak. I am deeply conscious that people in residential care are among the most vulnerable to coronavirus. We are doing everything we can to keep workers, residents and their families safe.We have already begun testing social care workers and will roll this out nationwide over the coming days. And as we continue to ramp up our testing programme, we will test all current care home residents with coronavirus symptoms and all new care home residents who are discharged from hospital into care.The announcement follows criticism that the government’s coronavirus strategy has ignored the social care sector, where there is evidence the virus is widespread.Labour’s shadow minister for social care Liz Kendall has said that “only 500 care staff having been tested to date”, and social care needs “a much greater priority and focus than it has had so far”.The BBC has seen a leaked Public Health England (PHE) document that says elements of personal protective equipment (PPE) could be reused by NHS staff as a “last resort”.It states that protective masks and gowns could need to be cleaned and reused when stocks run low and admits there is currently a “reduced ability to re-supply” PPE.

Writing in a letter to foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for the prime minister while he recovers from the virus, Starmer said:The question for Thursday therefore is no longer about whether the lockdown should be extended, but about what the government’s position is on how and when it can be eased in due course and on what criteria that decision will be taken.Responding to the Labour leader’s demand, a government source said:Talk of an exit strategy before we have reached the peak risks confusing the critical message that people need to stay at home in order to protect our NHS and save lives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a492d40bbfa7cbd79f24dc3ccd20d124a8f076/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16fc2f8e0e3130406cd8cc8929d5db88","title":"have you become unemployed due to coronavirus","story":"If you live in the UK and have lost your job due to the coronavirus pandemic, we would like to hear from youAccording to a former Bank of England official, unemployment in Britain  may surpass the levels reached during the Great Depression in the 1930s.David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Darmouth College in the US, said unemployment was rising at the fastest rate in living memory.If you have become unemployed due to the pandemic, we would like to hear from you.When were you made unemployed and what were the reasons?

Increases in universal credit and working tax credit to help families face the economic impacts of the coronavirus are welcome, but they don’t go far enough. An increase in child benefit of £10 a week per child would do much more, reducing child poverty by five percentage points compared to less than two percentage points as a result of the increases in universal credit and working tax credit.Gordon Brown: Labour chancellor (1997- 2007) and prime minister (2007-10)Covid-19 will push up child poverty for, sadly and unjustifiably, missing from the government rescue proposals is action to stop its inexorable rise. Had they raised child benefit and child tax credits, we could prevent hundreds of thousands of children being pushed into poverty. Now, poverty may rise beyond 5 million children by 2022, 2 million more than in 2015.We will remember the response to Covid-19 for many things: but a stain on our country, a scar on our soul as a nation, will be pushing child poverty in the UK to its highest level since statistics were first recorded 50 years ago – much worse than during the Thatcher years, when child poverty doubled.Having both universal child benefit and backing it up with tax credits is what I think took 2 million children out of poverty before 2010. But now, in real terms, child benefit is worth about £6 or £7 less than in 2010: that’s about a third less in value. Families are also losing out because wages have not been rising in the way that they should. But a decent wage has got to be accompanied by generous child benefits and by tax credits. There’s no doubt about it: you need all three.My son usually has free school meals. Right now the school is providing a £20 voucher each week. That’s helpful, but it still doesn’t cover feeding him lunches for a whole week. And they can only be used in three supermarkets and sometimes the prices have gone up a bit too.I live in a housing association flat in Leeds and I phoned my housing manager and told him that because of the crisis, I didn’t have any work. I could try to work online, but the people I work with don’t want that – and anyway they don’t have the money to pay me any more. Everyone is in the same boat right now. I had been taking a bit of time out to build my business, and then all this happened so I don’t qualify for the chancellor’s offer of help for self-employed people. I’ve put in a claim for universal credit. I’m waiting to hear about that.So far, we have food in the cupboard and a friend recently brought us round a bag of basics. But I’ve had to tell my son “we are on rations”, so you can’t help yourself because I don’t know how long that’s going to have to last for.The government could do something right away about bills, like gas and electricity. Especially the meters. It feels like the bills go up every six months. It’s diabolical. I’ve seen families paying £10 a day. People on benefits can’t afford that. A lot of people end up facing the choice of either keeping warm or eating. The government could immediately freeze costs, or at least stop increases.Naomi Eisenstadt: research fellow, LSE and University of Oxford, and former director of New Labour’s Sure Start unit and Social Exclusion Task ForceThe impact of Covid-19 on low-income families with children is likely to be more severe in the short term and recovery for these families will take much longer.What’s needed is demonstrable political will and focus on the policies affecting families with children in deep poverty. The government should start by using the most accurate poverty measures. The Social Metrics Commission measure includes family factors that increase the likelihood of poverty, such as a family member with disabilities, while the “minimum income standard” focuses on regional variations in the cost of living. For example, housing costs in the south-east are much higher than the north-west of England.We also need to stop blaming parents for their poverty. The majority of poor parents are poor because their income is not adequate, and poverty makes it harder for parents to follow parenting recommendations. Support for homework is harder in cramped, insecure accommodation. Parental behaviour does make a difference, decreasing the likelihood that today’s poor children will grow up to be poor adults themselves, but it is unlikely to reduce poverty for today’s children. The coronavirus will see many parents, particularly those on low wages, lose their jobs through no fault of their own. Any new policy should be assessed on two factors: will it increase families’ income or decrease costs?Kevin Hollinrake MP: Conservative chair, All-Party Parliamentary Group on PovertyWhat gets measured gets done. Therefore, you have to agree on the measure. From there, it’s a pretty simple iterative process of identifying the best solutions, testing what works and doing more of what works best.In the UK, we’re stuck on first base, with the government (absolute poverty) and the opposition (relative poverty) constantly and conveniently quoting two different measures. The first step should be to agree on a universal measure. The one I like best is produced by the Social Metrics Commission.We know that roughly 4 million people have been pushed into poverty because of housing costs. We also know that the government spends £22bn a year on housing benefit and that this has doubled since the early 2000s. About £10bn of this is paid to the private rented sector. What an opportunity. If we built many more truly affordable houses to rent and buy we could take millions of people out of poverty and reduce a significant burden from the shoulders of the taxpayer. It’s even more important now due to the coronavirus crisis. This will inevitably put many household budgets under severe pressure – and will result in evictions and homelessness.The good news is that there is a shovel-ready plan for this. If we increased our investment in affordable housing to £12.8bn a year over a sustained period, we could deliver millions of truly affordable, well-designed homes in beautiful mixed-tenure developments that would remove millions from poverty and reduce the taxpayers’ housing benefit burden.Ruth Lister: Labour peer and emeritus professor of social policy, Loughborough UniversityIt’s not fashionable to emphasise how much money in pockets matters, despite research showing its impact on children’s education and health, and how it makes parenting easier. Social security has a crucial role to play in reducing child poverty among both out-of-work and in-work families. That will be even more important now, as financial pressures increase – yet children’s benefits have been ignored in the government’s support package.Child poverty will increase dramatically in light of the pandemic: jobs are being lost and livelihoods threatened. The most vulnerable in our society are set to pay the highest price. But the pandemic also offers a once-in-several-generations opportunity to press the “reset” button on our economy and to think hard about the kind of society we want to be. Questions are already being asked about the pay of key workers, the merits of a universal basic income and the morality of wealthy business owners who furlough their workers. Communities are coming together in ways that have not been visible for decades.This crisis presents us with an opportunity to address the underlying causes of child poverty. We can learn from both the successes and failures of the last 20 years. Child poverty fell dramatically in the five years following Blair’s pledge in 1999 because more generous benefits and tax credits were directed towards the least well-off. Until governments around the globe are willing and able to address the weaknesses of capitalism that contribute towards family poverty (such as the inequalities in the gig economy), government-led income redistribution will be essential.While having enough money is vital, other things matter too. Strong relationships, a decent education, and good physical and mental health are also important weapons against poverty. Successive governments have recognised this. But political short-termism has undermined efforts. Programmes such as Sure Start, building in support from when a child is born, had the right ingredients but were expanded too quickly and were diluted in the process. And the investment needed to achieve transformational change, such as creating a highly skilled early years’ workforce to deliver such life-changing work, never materialised.You cannot tackle poverty by stealth. It requires the will of the people. Making progress seemed relatively easy when swimming with the tide of economic prosperity, but as soon as the economy dipped, the lack of overt public consent for income redistribution and family support meant they were easy targets for cuts. It wasn’t that the public opposed such measures, rather that they had never really been asked to support them.In a highly inidualistic society, political leaders have to be prepared to make the case for long-term investment to support the most vulnerable. So far, they seem to have left that job to the film director Ken Loach. Perhaps this pandemic will help us realise just how much we need to look out for each other."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52f76ff91469250af9459faeb9c66d11e010ccab/0_85_2491_1494/master/2491.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b55ab74e8a85b643cdf66f94926b53c","title":"richmond may be sustainable model for the future of championship rugby","story":"Club with no full-time players have won promotion but will not be changing their ethos or their pay structureRichmond’s return to the Championship is a parable for the most challenging period rugby has faced. A club that do not have contracts with their players and whose priority is the organisation and everyone involved in it rather than the first team stood alone the last time they were first promoted to English rugby’s second tier three years ago. But their model is set to be copied by others as the financial impact of the coronavirus lockdown deepens.“The finances of the Championship simply don’t work,” says Steve Hill, Richmond’s director of rugby for the past 10 years and first-team head coach. “With the cuts to it that will be made by the Rugby Football Union, more clubs will have to look at our model. Outside Ealing Trailfinders, who have a wealthy backer, virtually all are losing money and it cannot continue. You do not want clubs going out of existence but we are in danger of that happening as things stand.”Richmond’s two-season fling in the Premiership ended in 1999 when their backer pulled out and they dropped to the bottom of the league pyramid. They are trading places with Yorkshire Carnegie, who survived last season at the expense of the south-west London club after parachuting in players to help them to avoid relegation. Yorkshire controversially retained their status after agreeing a company voluntary agreement with creditors, having piled up debts of more than £500,000. This season Yorkshire have lost all 14 league games, are set to leave Headingley and are reverting back to being called Leeds.“I suppose it made our promotion doubly sweet,” Hill says. “The RFU told us Carnegie were going to be very competitive this season. We knew that would not be the case, but 12 months on we really enjoyed our season in National Division One, a cracking, incredibly competitive competition. We were not the favourites to win it, with some clubs paying a lot more than our match fees . The highest payers hit trouble and lost players, reinforcing my belief that rugby beneath the Premiership needs to be reset.“More teams will have to become part-time. There is no other way if rugby is to become financially sustainable. All sports will have to consider how and where money is spent. If rugby goes back to the days when clubs invested in facilities, coaching and creating a really good social atmosphere, that will attract players because they will not be able to do so by offering money. Some of the amounts being offered at level four and below are ridiculous: a lot of that will now have to disappear, which will be a good thing.”Like all clubs, Richmond have had to make adjustments as income all but stops but they have not had to furlough players who hold full-time jobs in spheres ranging from teaching and recruitment to carpentry and sourcing film locations for production companies. “We pay a match fee and it is the same whether you have played 150 matches for the club or are making your debut,” Hill says.“There are no contract negotiations and no one talks about money when they are having a meal after a game. They have proper conversations and I do not envy rugby directors who have to pick certain players because they are on big money. I can say to any new player that if they are good enough, they will be in the team it is a powerful recruitment tool and I would struggle to explain to someone why another player was worth twice as much as him. ”“I do not know how many of Saracens’ superstars will face us but anyone who plays for them is outstanding: their academy is second to none. It will be a fantastic occasion and we are looking forward to the away games at Cornish Pirates and Jersey, great weekends. We will stay over in Jersey and have a night out. We are not going to change as a club because we are in the Championship: ethos, environment and spirit are far more important than where your first team play.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc71a10094450f062bc66e61f277a973900442a/0_37_3780_2269/master/3780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97c0b2739365110458461fa907b553e1","title":"the right to repair planned obsolescence electronic waste mountain","story":"Unrepairable phones and laptops are one of the scandals of our throwaway society. But the pushback is building – and the coronavirus crisis has added more pressure for change ‘Imagine you showed someone a smartphone 20 years ago. You said: ‘Here’s this thing, it’s going to be awesome, and it’ll cost $1,000. But the manufacturers are going to glue the battery in, and you’re supposed to get rid of it when the battery wears out.’ You would have thought that notion was completely bananas.”Nathan Proctor is talking via Google Hangouts from Boston, Massachusetts, about an allegedly central feature of modern manufacturing known as planned obsolescence. This is the idea that some of the world’s biggest companies have been selling us products either knowing full well that they will only last a couple of years, or having deliberately built a short life into the itemor its software.It is a charge the companies would reject, but we all have everyday knowledge of what he is talking about – the suddenly dead or “bricked” – made as useless as a brick – phone, discarded printer or broken laptop. Most of us dismiss the phenomenon as an irritating but unavoidable feature of modern life. But Proctor is the director of the Right to Repair campaign spawned by the US’s Public Interest Research Group (founded in 1971 by the celebrated activist Ralph Nader), and he wants us to see things very differently.Now, finally, across the world, tentative moves are being made to end this culture of obsolescence. In the US, Apple has recently agreed to pay up to $500m in settlements related to allegations that software updates caused older iPhones – such as the iPhone 6, 6s Plus, 7 and 7 Plus – to slow down (the company denied any wrongdoing, and insisted the technique prevented older devices from shutting down altogether). In France, the same issue resulted in a fine of €25m (£21m).In Norway, the supreme court is deciding on the battle between Apple and Henrik Huseby, the owner of a small phone-repair shop, and the company’s pursuit of claims about “counterfeit” replacement screens that he insists were taken from old Apple devices. Meanwhile, the European commission has recently announced plans aimed at ensuring that a range of products will be “recyclable, repairable and designed to last longer” as part of a plan to halve waste across the EU by 2030.Different consumer choices might also be part of the answer, and Proctor’s life as a tech consumer offers examples. The computer he is using to talk to me, he explains, is a Frankenstein PC – custom-built from parts of different computers, some of which were bought in the early 1990s. His iPhone dates from 2013. But he emphasises that what we choose to buy is much less important than the actions of governments and companies.“We’re not going to fix this problem person by person, changing how we treat smartphones. The companies that make millions of smartphones should just not make them to break.” A few computer companies do better (“HP and Dell provide access to firmware, spare parts and tutorials – they’re really good, as far as we can tell”), but their actions heighten his exasperation that many tech corporations are reluctant to follow suit.Meanwhile, the coronavirus crisis has brought our need for greater resilience and sustainability into sharp focus. Proctor noticed this from the start. “A lot of new equipment – whether it’s your electric fan or iPhone or networking equipment for your school or office – comes from China,” he says. “And because Chinese manufacturing was affected first, a lot of wholesalers saw a pretty significant increase in the demand for used equipment – whether that was laptops that schools were trying to redistribute so that kids could do homework, or hardware so that people could handle more remote operations.”But wholesalers and refurbishers found much of the equipment was locked against reuse because of manufacturers’ systems. “You can buy the hardware, but you don’t have the permissions to use it without getting some kind of new service agreement. So that’s another problem.”The idea of planned or built-in obsolescence is certainly not new – it was first written about in 1928 by the American marketing pioneer Justus George Frederick. In the words of one subsequent account: “He stated that it was necessary to induce people to buy an ever-increasing variety of things, not in order to use them but to activate commerce and discard them after a short period of time.” The concept even has its own film – in The Man in the White Suit (made in 1951, and recently screened as part of a BBC Two Ealing comedies series sparked by the lockdown), a chemist falls foul of textile producers and trade unions for creating a material that never needs replacing.Nearly a century on from Frederick’s description, it seems his idea is everywhere, and it sometimes feels as if we are drowning in the detritus of planned obsolescence. The average time an inidual keeps a smartphone is reckoned to be between two and three years. Astonishingly, according to EU research, the average lifetime of desktop printers is a mere five hours and four minutes of actual printing time. Ever-changing software spells the demise of fully functioning devices – which is why so many of us have household drawers filled with old ones, left behind – and often bricked – by the same companies that made them.Symbols of the extent to which companies make user repairs of their devices either impossible or extremely difficult are everywhere. iPhones are partly held together by Pentalobe screws, which are immune to standard screwdrivers. Some Amazon Kindles are constructed using glued plastic casing that is all but impossible to prise open. The reluctance of big companies to release information about the workings of their products is a constant source of frustration.All this is being closely watched by a Brussels-based organisation called the European Environmental Bureau. One of the groups’s key staff members, 28-year-old Jean-Pierre Schweitzer, tells me the EU’s plans for digital devices promise to extend the rules that apply to such household objects as fridges and washing machines to laptops, tablets and smartphones. “We’re talking about really serious requirements, which include things about spare parts and product information,” he says. Yet this prospect is still five or six years away, while Brexit means that even such belated moves may not apply in the UK, and our own mound of discarded electronic stuff could just carry on growing.Schweitzer has a few betes noires. “One is wireless headphones,” he says. “People single out the Apple ones, but a lot of the other manufacturers are just as bad. The problem with lots of them is that you can’t replace the batteries. As soon as they run out, that’s it. Anything where you have an issue with the battery is really problematic, because they are all lithium-ion. Those are really rare, valuable resources. But because head-headphones are so small, people just throw them in their waste bins.“Increasingly, I’m hearing a lot of complaints about products from Amazon. All of their stuff: Kindles, the hardware connected with Amazon Prime – apparently it has a very short life. We’re just getting to see that now.”When I contact Apple, I get an email about its use of recycled materials: “Apple is using recycled cobalt from iPhone batteries recovered by its disassembly robot Daisy combined with scrap from final assembly sites for brand-new Apple batteries.”I then get a second email, which points to an announcement from last year, about “a new repair programme, offering customers additional options for the most common out-of-warranty iPhone repairs.“Apple will provide more independent repair businesses – large or small – with the same genuine parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostics as its Apple Authorized Service Providers.” This sounds like a modest victory for Right to Repair campaigners, but the announcement also contains a warning about using counterfeit parts.When I contact Amazon, a spokesperson says it is committed to sustainability. “We have built a refurbishment and trade-in programme that kept millions of devices from ending up in landfills in 2019 alone. We also design our products to last so that customers do not have to upgrade to new hardware every year – in fact, many of our products are still in use after five years.”With a hint that Amazon, too, is at least starting to hear the noise made by Right to Repair campaigners, it goes on: “We know we have more work to do to allow our customers to make informed choices and to provide transparent information about the environmental impacts of devices through their whole life cycle.”Martine Postma is a former journalist, and founder of the international network of Repair Cafés that began in 2009 in her native Amsterdam. Volunteers meet people who arrive with items that needs fixing, and in the process learn about bringing products back to life. The network now extends to 36 countries.In Levenshulme, south Manchester, 33-year-old Jack Laycock is one of the key organisers of his local Repair Café which, until the Covid-19 outbreak, met once a month, with five or six repairers, and at least 20 customers. When I ask him why he does it, the answer comes back in a flash. “There’s just so much waste,” he says. “It’s unbelievable how much stuff we throw away. The Earth can’t sustain it. That was my reason for getting involved. But also, where I live is quite a erse area: there’s a lot of people who just can’t afford to buy new stuff all the time.”When I mention technology, the conversation takes a forlorn turn. Computers, he says, often prove impossible to fix. And smartphones? “We don’t even take phones. They’re so fiddly and small: if the screen’s cracked, it’s possible to repair it, but we don’t have the tools.”In search of hope, I speak to Olivia Webb, the outreach co-ordinator at iFixit. The Wiki-based website is the online home for a global community and offers a world of advice about how to fix tech devices, plus a shop selling repair tools. It is starting to build up a stock of information about the maintenance and repair of hospital equipment, including ventilators.iFixit has two HQs, one in Stuttgart, the other in San Luis Obispo, California, where about 150 people work. Its origin dates back to the early 2000s, when one of its founders broke his MacBook and, on finding no helpful information online, created his own repair guide. Now the site has an estimated 10 million visitors a month – thanks to the refusal of large swathes of the tech industry to help people to do their own repairs.iFixit is a private company, but Webb also works on advocacy for the Right to Repair, which is now focused on lobbying the US government. “We were doing really well this year until the coronavirus happened,” she says. “We had got legislation introduced in 21 states. We were making progress, but when the virus happened, it threw everything into question. But we’re in a really good position, I think.”What, ultimately, is it all about? “Our goal is to take back ownership of what we have. That means being able to open it, tinker with it, change things inside it or whatever, without getting into trouble with the manufacturer. “There are thousands of tonnes of e-waste we throw away every year that are just marinating. That really has to change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d7356c5bc9a851f64c8329b28561c7093dfb20c/294_203_1858_1115/master/1858.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84978fda69dbc80bdf07c63304392f4a","title":"the psychology of firsts and why they stick in our memories","story":"Anecdotally, we all know that first-time experiences hold a unique and  formative power over us. But why? Fiona Cowood investigates ...First love, first kiss, first job, first car … it’s easy to transport yourself back to those heady experiences, even though decades may have passed since they happened. Contrast that with a simple question about what you did last Wednesday … can you honestly remember?Meik Wiking runs the world’s only Happiness Research Institute in Denmark, and in his latest book, the Art of Making Memories, explores the hold that first experiences have over us.“First experiences stick better to our memories,” he says. “Several studies show that we are better at remembering the novel and the new, the extraordinary days when we did something different.” This helps to explain why, as we get older, we might have dozens of treasured memories from our youth while our present flashes by with perhaps only a house move and a holiday memory-banked for safekeeping. Wiking refers to this phenomenon as the “reminiscence bump”, AKA “the good old days” – that period from 15-30 that is the source of so many of the stories we tell about ourselves.“Firsts in my 40s are rarer than when I was 15,” says Wiking, “but that’s why I seek them out now. First experiences are able to stretch the flow of time – they can help stop the feeling that the years are going by quicker and quicker.”“When we’re out of our comfort zone, we make sure we record every aspect of the experience in case we need to retrieve the memory later on,” he says. “For example, we might not know if the situation is safe or dangerous so we open up our senses to pick up all the signs and signals.”First experiences also serve as building blocks, helping us to construct a solid sense of who we are in the world. Any parent will know how much children love being told the stories of their first steps, or their first trip to the swimming pool. Those moments are insights into identity-building, as kids make sense of how they got to where they are today. As we get older, these “firsts” become bookmarks that distinguish between chapters – who you were before a major breakup, versus who you became, for example.“Each of us has an ancient and universal human need to be seen and to be remembered,” says Wiking, “and firsts, and changes of scene, play an important role in organising autobiographical memory.”To avoid the mid-years of your life becoming a depressing blur of chores, childcare and days spent at the same desk, Wiking advocates opening yourself up to new experiences to ensure a steady imprint of new, vivid memories. Memorable grownup firsts can come in all shapes and sizes – from big, bucket-list adventures in far-flung places to practical, domestic endeavours, like hosting your first Christmas or driving your first electric car.And making these little adjustments not only enriches your own life but will positively affect others too, says Wiking. “One of my biggest ‘a-ha’ moments in writing the book was going from a perception that memory is something random that we don’t control to realising that my memory – and that of my friends and family – is actually something I can influence. Realising I can influence what my friends remember in 10 years’ time is very empowering. It makes you want to do new things – and share those experiences with others.”You’ll always remember your first EVUnlock the thrill of a game-changing first for yourself with the New Renault ZOE – the ideal first electric car.

Forecasts suggest a medium-term crossover point, probably towards the end of this decade, where the car industry is making more EVs than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Against that, there still exists a great deal of scepticism in the minds of consumers.“An EV wouldn’t work for me because …” is a familiar conversation starter. It’s true, there are some people for whom an electric car is simply a non-starter – but that number is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. For most, an EV is going to be a money saver that makes no obvious impact on lifestyle.Emily Rice, Renault UK’s product manager for electric cars, answers three readers’ questions.I live in a terraced house and park in the street, so I’m unable to have a home charging point. What are my charging options? Elaine Hills, BrightonAlthough it’s true that many current EV owners like to charge their cars at home using a dedicated wall-mounted charger in their driveway or garage, the good news is it’s far from the only option.The charging infrastructure to support EVs is constantly growing and evolving. For instance, it was reported in May last year that 1,076 new residential EV charging points had been installed in London as part of the Go Ultra Low City Scheme (GULCS), and this figure continues to increase. Virgin Media recently began a pilot project to convert its broadband cabinets into charging points, with a view to eventually providing 40,000 EV charging points across the UK. Elsewhere, there are initiatives such as the MK Promise, through which Milton Keynes council offers to install, within a short walk, an overnight charging point for all new EV owners lacking access to private parking.Access to a public residential charger is, however, still rare, and the much more common practice is to charge at the other end of a regular journey. “If you’d like to buy an EV, but don’t have the ability to charge it at home, check whether your workplace has charging facilities,” says Rice. “It’s common to simply not notice charging infrastructure if you don’t own an EV – but once you start thinking about switching, you really start to notice how many charging points are around you.”It’s worth noting that the notional “full charge” is an ICE hangover, driving until the warning light comes on and then filling the tank. Getting a full charge in Sainsbury’s or Starbucks may take a few hours – but with EVs such as the New Renault ZOE having a driving range of 245 miles*, it is unlikely you will need to find somewhere to charge every day, so owners aren’t arriving with the (usually metaphorical) needle in the red.If you charge an EV and then don’t use it, have you wasted your electricity? Jonathan Bailey, SheffieldThe short answer is: no. Or rather, not really. “The thing people tend to ask about is leaving their car when they go on holiday,” says Rice. “If you leave your car at the airport for a couple of weeks, you’re not going to notice a discharge. There’s lots of inbuilt technology in a Renault ZOE designed to ensure the batteries are as efficient as possible. Even if you leave your EV sitting around for a few months, it’s not going to be an issue for the traction battery.”The concern allied to this is the idea that battery performance will be less impressive as the vehicle gets older. While battery capacity can drop as the vehicle gets older – it won’t be to the extent it did a decade ago when the technology was in its infancy.“I think a lot of people worry that the battery in an EV is like the one in their phone, and they’re going to see the performance decline after a couple of years – but it really isn’t like that,” says Rice. “We all know that a phone reaches a point where you’re having to charge it a couple of times a day – but the technology in the lithium-ion battery of the car is far superior to that. If you’re driving it in the same way as a petrol or diesel car, you’re not going to experience any problems with an EV. We know it’s an area of concern, though, which is why Renault gives its EV batteries an eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty**. Hopefully that inspires confidence in the technology.”Is it more difficult to get a problem with an EV car resolved because there are fewer expert mechanics? Edward Jones, NorthamptonshireThe downside is that most of these technicians are employed by mainstream dealerships, with relatively little EV expertise in backstreet garages. EVs are, however, selling in ever-larger numbers, and mechanics are not immune to market forces. More technicians will train on EVs because, slowly but surely, that’s where the market is heading.Curious to learn more about EVs?

It has not one, but two character-cementing power walks for its star, Cate Blanchett, as Phyllis Schlafly, the anti-feminist conservative activist justifiably loathed by many Americans. In the first, she silently saunters down a pageant runway in a patriotic swimsuit, game to put looks ahead of intellect. In the second, halfway through the first episode, she marches into the Capitol soundtracked by Steppenwolf’s Magic Carpet Ride, a pink tweed dress walking against feminist protesters outside and blue-suited men within. It’s a bold proposal, to ride through the 1970s’ women’s movement and counter-revolution with an icon of the religious right, and in Blanchett’s hands, it’s electric.It’s also a splashy contrast to the show’s strength: thorny conversations and the personal moments which form movements, for better or for worse. Though it can at times wade into wonky thickets (primary delegates, how do those work?), Mrs America is a punchy disco-ball of a show, a full portrait of Schlafly’s root in the women’s campaign against women and such second-wave feminist icons as Gloria Steinem (Rose Byrne), Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba) and Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman).It’s a tricky move to base a show around the fight over the Equal Rights Amendment, a piece of legislation first introduced in 1923 to enshrine protection from discrimination by sex in the constitution. Trickier still to make the linchpin Schlafly, the anti-feminist, anti-gay “family values” crusader whose coalition of conservatives tanked the ERA, once a bipartisan surefire, in the course of a decade. But Mrs America, created by Mad Men writer Dahvi Waller, mines the past for conflicts and contradictions with contemporary relevance, splicing warm-hued archival footage with deeply researched scripts with a roving structure. Each episode focuses on one woman (as go the titles – Gloria, Shirley, Betty etc) as she navigates the public fight for equal rights amid the personal struggles for opportunity, unity and political coherence in one’s private life.There’s a common and familiar theme of principles versus practicality in these stories. Byrne, in particular, is excellent as Steinem, the media darling of independent womanhood grappling with her role as a leader who instinctively attracts publicity. Aduba’s Chisholm, the first black woman to run for president in 1972, is a deep well of unfathomable confidence and frustration at the compromises made for progress. Margo Martindale takes no prisoners as Representative Bella Abzug, an organizer of the National Women’s Political Caucus, and Elizabeth Banks pinch-hits as Jill Ruckelshaus, a Republican feminist alarmed by the rise of Schlafly’s far-right strain in her party. Feminist-focusing moments speak to contemporary struggles at coalition building, such as how a space like Steinem’s Ms Magazine is less amenable to black feminists like editor Margaret Sloan (Bria Henderson) than its utopian vision admits.And punch for punch there’s Schlafly, the focus of the first episode and, for lack of a better term, humanized anti-hero of the show’s feminist vision. Mrs America takes pains to color in the black-and-white dichotomy – Schlafly and her Eagle Forum bad, feminists good – with which most viewers will probably enter. In Washington, Schlafly is cut off from her missile strategy spiel by a congressman who wants her to take notes the men continue without her as she fetches a pen. She comes home to her husband Fred (John Slattery) weary he wants to have sex, she doesn’t. Guess who wins out.With Blanchett, masterful as ever and an executive producer on the show, you can’t help but step into Schlafly’s shoes, and there will be those who argue, fairly, that Mrs America gives too much latitude to Schlafly’s gender crusade over her racist, homophobic fight to preserve her upper-class white status. Elements of this work into series subplots: Schlafly’s anti-gay agenda traps her beloved eldest son in the closet, and her home is run by black women on staff and her spinster sister. But I’d argue that like The Americans, another prestige FX project set in late cold-war America, Mrs America burrows into the loyalties, betrayals and motivations of “them” without condoning the implications of their actions Schlafly’s abetting of the Klan in her coalition, though presented here as a tactical move for numbers, says volumes about her politics.Schlafly ultimately won the battle – the ERA died in 1982 three states short of ratification, and the election of her dream candidate, Ronald Reagan, ends the series. But the war continues. Waller has said she began the project before the 2016 election, before the #MeToo movement, before a widespread state-level crackdown on abortion access, before select states revived the fight to ratify the ERA by rescinding the deadline. Whether or not you see prestige anti-hero treatment as illuminating or obfuscating the connections between Schlafly’s “traditional” values and Make America Great Again is, I suppose, a matter of how you fill the void behind Schlafly’s steely composure in a flawlessly executed series. But there’s no doubt an intoxicating thrill in tracing how, exactly, we got here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/027eb94ad1529cae5573fefc29129b6d9565b7b2/0_81_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c4950dd4ddb251185a49051131d1223","title":"barack obama endorse joe biden 2020 election democrats","story":"Former president announces support for presumptive nominee, his former VP, in statementBarack Obama has endorsed Joe Biden for president, casting his former vice-president as the experienced statesman and unifying leader that will be needed to confront the public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic that will probably be the defining issue of the 2020 presidential election.Obama’s endorsement, a 12-minute video published on Tuesday, came just one day after Biden’s one-time rival Bernie Sanders threw his weight behind him and appealed to progressives to unify against Donald Trump. Ahead of what is certain to be a historically isive general election fight, the former president called for “Americans of all political stripes” to come together in a “great awakening” behind the presumptive Democratic nominee.“Joe has the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery,” Obama said in his endorsement video.The announcement was Obama’s most extended public commentary on the 2020 election to date. In his remarks, he emphasized Biden’s preparedness to lead the country in this perilous moment, delivered a blistering attack on Republicans, and sought to unify the party in the wake of a fractious primary.“Pandemics have a way of cutting through a lot of noise and spin to remind us of what is real, and what is important,” Obama said. “This crisis has reminded us that government matters. It’s reminded us that good government matters.”The former president remains incredibly popular among Democrats and his active support for Biden could play a key role in energizing and consolidating the party around Biden’s candidacy, which still lacks a spark of enthusiasm even as he racked up a string of commanding primary victories.Obama declined to play a public role in the primary, which Sanders’ departure from the race last week in effect ended, elevating Biden to presumptive nominee. In his remarks, he praised the rivals Biden defeated in the Democratic primary, which he said featured “one of the most impressive Democratic fields ever”. Singling out Sanders, Obama said the Vermont senator was an “American original” who would be critical to defeating Trump in November.When Sanders exited the race, Trump tried to sow discord by questioning why Obama had not yet endorsed Biden.“It does amaze me that President Obama hasn’t supported Sleepy Joe,” the president said during a coronavirus briefing, speculating that his predecessor “knows something that you don’t know, that I think I know, that you don’t know.”In a statement on Tuesday, the Trump campaign suggested Obama was somehow reluctant to support his former vice-president, with whom he shared an uncommon friendship and whom he awarded the presidential medal of freedom in 2017.“Obama has no other choice but to support him,” said Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager. “Even Bernie Sanders beat him to it.”In 2008, Obama assembled a coalition of African Americans, suburban women, white working-class voters and, crucially, young people in what many Democrats remember as one of the most inspirational campaigns in modern history.Biden has drawn support from similar constituencies but is missing a key part of that coalition: young people, who remain deeply skeptical of his candidacy.To the dismay of some Democrats, Obama has mostly continued the tradition of former presidents by not criticizing his successor, even as Trump has dismantled his legacy on everything from healthcare to climate change. In the midst of a pandemic, Trump has sought to deflect criticism by blaming his predecessor.On Tuesday Obama did not mention his successor by name, instead assailing the party Trump leads and implicitly criticizing him with praise of Biden.“One thing everybody has learned by now is that the Republicans occupying the White House and running the US Senate are not interested in progress,” Obama said. “They’re interested in power.”﻿Biden’s association with Obama helped propel him ahead of younger rivals. His eight years as Obama’s No 2 contributed greatly to his support among African American voters, particularly in South Carolina, the foundation of a remarkable campaign turnaround.His time as vice-president was also central to his argument that he is a capable, experienced leader best positioned to beat Trump in November.Obama made a similar case in his endorsement video, citing Biden’s leadership during the Great Recession, as well as his management of the H1N1 and Ebola crises.Healthcare proved to be a flashpoint during the primary, with candidates ided between expanding the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature achievement, or seeking universal health coverage.Biden has resisted Sanders’ Medicare for All plan and advocated for building on the ACA, nicknamed Obamacare.In his video, Obama said it was time to “go further” and ensure that all Americans have access to healthcare, calling on Democrats to push for a public option, expand Medicare and “finish the job so that healthcare isn’t just a right, but a reality for everybody”. Biden, who has pledged to choose a woman for his vice-president, told donors on a fundraising call that Obama advised him to choose someone who is not afraid to disagree with him and who will “always tell me the truth”.“The most important thing – and I’ve actually talked to Barack about this – the most important thing is that there has to be someone who, the day after they’re picked, is prepared to be president of the United States of America if something happened,” Biden said at the virtual fundraiser."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/406e166dd8ac8cac851403c823bcaddbd38f6915/0_141_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d31ee8a92ce596950a781bd13ebe4a5","title":"us bidet toilet paper sales coronavirus","story":"The stress hoarding is forcing Americans low on toilet paper and ‘bidet curious’ to finally purchase one – and to some, it’s even a pandemic lifehackI had been “bidet curious” for years. But it wasn’t until my husband sent me a photo of the ransacked paper products aisle at the supermarket that I finally decided to take the plunge.A couple of days later, I got a text from a friend running low on toilet paper. I told her about my recent bidet purchase. Minutes later she messaged me again: the company I suggested was backordered through the end of the month.It seems that America, too, has discovered the bidet.In the first week of March, “we saw sales starting to double what they had been the month prior”, said Jason Ojalvo, CEO of Tushy, a bidet company founded in 2015. “Then two days later they were triple what they usually are, and then suddenly it was 10 times what normal sales are. A few days later it peaked at a million-dollar sales per day.”Owing to shelter-in-place restrictions across the country, families need more toilet paper at home. While previously they used the bathroom at work, school and restaurants, they are now going at home. The type of toilet paper in short supply are luxury brands – double-ply and made of virgin fiber – as opposed to the single-ply recycled paper that businesses tend to use.Rather than chasing rumors of where toilet paper was last seen on shelves, some millennials see purchasing a bidet as a kind of pandemic lifehack. Kaitlyn Braswell, a management analyst in Chicago who ordered hers a few days ago, is looking forward to what she describes as a new level of cleanliness. She only wishes she had ordered it sooner – it’s expected to ship in mid-May.In Italy, where bidets are in every household, the American rush for toilet paper remains a mystery. It’s completely unthinkable that American bathrooms would be without such an essential piece of equipment. As far back as 1975, a hygiene law stated: “For each accommodation, at least one bathroom must be equipped with the following sanitary facilities: toilet, bidet, bath or shower, washbasin.”America’s disdain for bidets has no clear basis. Douching was once thought to be a kind of birth control, and in 1936 an onlooker suggested that “the presence of a bidet is regarded as almost a symbol of sin”, according to the Atlantic. One convoluted theory  holds that American soldiers in Europe during the second world war visited French brothels and saw the basins, which they instantly associated with prostitution. Today the stress hoarding of toilet paper has become exactly the incentive that many people needed to make a decision they may have been mulling for years.For Brandon Krajewski, a film-maker living in Los Angeles, a combination of the rumored paper shortage and Tushy’s marketing convinced him to wash instead of wipe.“We had a bidet experience several months prior while staying at an Airbnb and liked it. Once we saw all the toilet paper flying off the shelves, we realized we could reduce our costs and paper waste.”Tushy isn’t the only bidet brand seeing an incredible spike in sales. Business Insider has reported that Brondell is “selling a bidet on Amazon every two minutes, or about 1,000 units per day”. The demand for some of the bidet attachments that Hygiene for Health sells has doubled over the last two weeks.The timing could be a boon for the environment. Trees are a carbon sink, and a (controversial) study published last year claimed the world has the capacity for at least another trillion trees, which could mitigate climate change. If Americans gave up toilet paper, they could keep 15m trees from being turned into pulp every year. Instead of deforesting Canada’s boreal forest, one of the largest carbon stores on the planet would be preserved.Bidets can, surprisingly, also help conserve water. Manufacturing one roll of toilet paper requires 37 gallons of water, Scientific American has reported. Some bidets, by comparison, use one-eighth of a gallon a flush. Also contributing to toilet paper’s carbon footprint are the hundreds of thousands of tons of chlorine required to make toilet paper white, the energy required in the manufacturing process, the single-use plastic that it gets packaged in, and the fuel for shipping .Now quarantined at his house in Madison, Wisconsin, Josh Faulkes, manager of the Wisconsin Society of Cytology, said the pandemic has changed the bidet from a fantasy item to a necessity.“This situation moved the product from a ‘one of these days’ luxury item to a more practical purchase, up there with replacing our back door and changing our tires.”Though he views ownership of a bidet as entirely practical, Faulkes is actually splashing out and getting one with warm water, a heated toilet seat and a warm air dryer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88c415fb4e5578aa486ab1d4de6e15c35662303b/0_16_1934_1161/master/1934.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9e993fa32a14ba961db091d34bcf9c1","title":"bangkok water festival venue before and during coronavirus","story":"Photographs taken in Bangkok before and since the coronavirus outbreak show the emptied locations of the city’s annual water festivalIn Thailand the Songkran festival was cancelled nationwide to combat the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Unless there is some enormously larger amount of herd immunity than we’re aware of … the majority of the population is still susceptible.In its daily briefings, the UK government has not outlined plans beyond the current restrictions, but the latest paper adds to a building scientific consensus that physical distancing may be required for considerably longer in order to keep case numbers within hospitals’ critical care capacity.Papers released by the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) in March suggested that the UK would need to alternate between periods of more and less strict physical distancing measures for a year to have a plausible chance of keeping the number of critical care cases within capacity.The prospect of intermittent distancing raises difficult questions about what guidance will be given to high-risk groups, including over-70s and those with compromised immune systems.It may be possible to relax distancing measures periodically while maintaining cases within a volume that health services can cope with, but the grave health risks of infection to some people will remain the same until a vaccine or highly effective treatments are available.New treatments, a vaccine, or increasing critical care capacity could alleviate the need for stringent physical distancing, according to the paper in Science. “But in the absence of these, surveillance and intermittent distancing may need to be maintained into 2022,” the authors conclude.The overall numbers of cases in the next five years, and the level of distancing required, were found to depend crucially on the overall current levels of infection and whether all those who are infected gain immunity and, if so, for how long. The authors cautioned that these are big unknowns and that a precise prediction of the long-term dynamics is not possible.If immunity is permanent, Covid-19 could disappear for five or more years after the first outbreak, the paper suggests. If people have immunity for about a year, as is seen for some other circulating coronaviruses, an annual outbreak cycle would be the most likely outcome.Asked to speculate on which of these scenarios was more likely, Lipsitch said: “Reasonable guesses are that there might be partial protection for close to a year. On the long end, it might be several years of good protection. It’s really speculative at this point.”Under all scenarios considered, however, the models found that a one-time lockdown would result in a resurgence after restrictions are lifted.Serological surveys, assessing the proportion of the population carrying protective antibodies, will be crucial to establish whether people have long-lasting immunity.Other teams have found evidence that the immune response varies across people, with those who only have mild or no symptoms showing a far weaker response.Prof Marion Koopmans, the head of virology at the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, whose team is studying the antibody response of those infected, said complete and permanent protection would be unusual for a respiratory virus.“What you would expect to see – hope to see – is that people who have had it once … the disease would get milder,” she said before the latest paper was released.Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, said: “This is an excellent study that uses mathematical models to explore the dynamics of Covid-19 over a period of several years, in contrast to previously published studies that have focused on the coming weeks or months.“It is important to recognise that it is a model it is consistent with current data but is nonetheless based on a series of assumptions – for example about acquired immunity – that are yet to be confirmed. The study should therefore be regarded as suggesting possible scenarios rather than making firm predictions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2eed1731272d41f762a25f7241f90d5a27d926e/1_0_4997_3000/master/4997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=205913d925ca00427c4093723e2f08e7","title":"should everyone be wearing face masks","story":"No robust evidence ordinary masks stop wearers getting infected but some experts say they could make a big difference In recent weeks, face masks have become an unremarkable sight in streets and supermarkets.Many people are choosing to cover their mouth and nose with online-bought or homemade masks or scarves, in spite of the advice of the World Health Organization and, in the UK, from Public Health England, that they are no protection against coronavirus.Yet one country after another has decided to depart from the WHO guidance and rule that masks should be worn – most notably the US.To add to the confusion, on Monday, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, said the UK position on masks was under review and would change if the scientific evidence warranted it.This followed remarks by David Nabarro, a UN special envoy on Covid-19, who appeared to depart from the WHO’s line by suggesting the UK would have to get used to wearing masks.“The virus isn’t going to go away and we don’t know if people who have had the virus stay immune afterwards,” he told the BBC, adding: “Yes, we will have to wear masks.”Despite the mixed messages, the WHO guidance updated a week ago, has remained consistent.It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” it stated.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.Underlying WHO’s concerns are the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.There is also concern the public will not understand how to use a mask and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Most of all, there is no robust scientific evidence – in the form or trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them.N95 masks, worn by doctors and nurses who are treating people with Covid-19, certainly do. But the virus particles are thought to pass through other types of mask.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected by the virus.It is accepted that they can block the transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.In the US, Donald Trump has advised people to wear masks whenever they go out, while stressing it is not compulsory, citing advice from the Centers for Disease Control. In France, the Academy of Medicine has recommended the use of a “general public” mask – to differentiate it from the mask used by healthcare workers.There is now increasing pressure for the UK stance on masks to change. Even marginal gains could make a difference is at the heart of the argument.Prof Trisha Greenhalgh from the Nuffield department of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, and colleagues wrote a paper published by the British Medical Journal last week that argued in favour of “the precautionary principle”.The standard level of scientific evidence is no good in this issue, she told the . Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard in drug development, but not appropriate to face masks in a pandemic, she said.“The point is we have now got a hugely complex issue going on. The last thing we need is a controlled experiment. We need to follow the logic of complex systems,.”Greenhalgh thinks the whole population of the UK should wear masks – just as they do in South Korea, where the epidemic curve is far lower than ours.We could make that acceptable, she said, by making it fun – encouraging people to make and personalise their own.Even if masks do not become the norm, it is quite possible they will anyway become part of the strategy for the exit from lockdown, at which point not only will every possible way of preventing new infections be considered, but the public will be so keen to resume “normal” life that it is hard to imagine anyone refusing to comply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9bf564630e839c242632b7d8e77224a86cc0653/0_154_3824_2294/master/3824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af55910e63d8d98350ed8cf86aa316d4","title":"uk coronavirus rules autism learning disabilities lockdown","story":"People with learning disabilities or autism can leave the house for exercise more than once a day and can travel outside of their local area under current lockdown measures, the government has said.The guidance, which had previously stated that non-essential workers should only leave their homes once a day for exercise or to shop for basic necessities, was amended on Wednesday.Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs.\u0026nbspAs this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help.The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families.If you want to help,\u0026nbspfind your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America’s Covid-19 response fund.Food banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use\u0026nbspFeeding America’s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you’re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, “stay home” is the advice.Feeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.The updated advice reads: “If you (or a person in your care) have a specific health condition that requires you to leave the home to maintain your health – including if that involves travel beyond your local area – then you can do so.“This could, for example, include where iniduals with learning disabilities or autism require specific exercise in an open space two or three times each day – ideally in line with a care plan agreed with a medical professional.”Although those with autism and mental health conditions are advised to limit their travel, and stay as close to their local area as possible, carers and support workers who do not live in their household can accompany them.The change comes after lawyers from Bindmans LLP and 39 Essex Chambers were asked for help by two families with children on the autistic spectrum.Bindmans said one of the children, whose conditions mean it was necessary for them to leave the house more than once a day for their wellbeing, was deliberately taken to a quiet location outside of their local area because of their particular needs.The firms argued that the “inflexible policy”, which also says people should stay two metres apart from anyone outside of their household, disproportionately impacted those with certain health conditions and was “therefore unlawful and discriminatory”.After the amendment was made to the guidance, one of the affected families said they were “delighted” they could support their son’s needs “without breaking the rules”.A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office said the most important action the public could take during the pandemic was to stay home to prevent the spread of Covid-19.But, it added: “We understand that this will be more difficult for some, that is why we clarified the guidance regarding the needs of those with specific health conditions such as learning disabilities or autism.”• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bc91d379a13d96c69c683187a8e143140f557e5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c28ea51ef21c1b1c0dcc456098e826cb","title":"coronavirus latest 15 april at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, there are more than 1,982,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world.

But did it then spread to pangolins and humans?In the public mind, the origin story of coronavirus seems well fixed: in late 2019 someone at the now world-famous Huanan seafood market in Wuhan was infected with a virus from an animal.The rest is part of an awful history still in the making, with Covid-19 spreading from that first cluster in the capital of China’s Hubei province to a pandemic that has killed about 80,000 people so far.Stock footage of pangolins – a scaly mammal that looks like an anteater – have made it on to news bulletins, suggesting this animal was the staging post for the virus before it spread to humans.But there is uncertainty about several aspects of the Covid-19 origin story that scientists are trying hard to unravel, including which species passed it to a human. They’re trying hard because knowing how a pandemic starts is a key to stopping the next one.Prof Stephen Turner, head of the department of microbiology at Melbourne’s Monash University, says what’s most likely is that virus originated in bats.But that’s where his certainty ends, he says.On the hypothesis that the virus emerged at the Wuhan live animal market from an interaction between an animal and a human, Turner says: “I don’t think it’s conclusive by any means.”“Part of the problem is that the information is only as good as the surveillance,” he says, adding that viruses of this type are circulating all the time in the animal kingdom.The fact that the virus has infected a tiger in a New York zoo shows how viruses can move around between species, he says. “Understanding the breadth of species this virus can infect is important as it helps us narrow down down where it might have come from.”Scientists say it is highly likely that the virus came from bats but first passed through an intermediary animal in the same way that another coronavirus – the 2002 Sars outbreak – moved from horseshoe bats to cat-like civets before infecting humans.One animal implicated as an intermediary host between bats and humans is the pangolin. The International Union for Conservation of Nature says they are “the most illegally traded mammal in the world” and are prized for their meat and the claimed medicinal properties of their scales.As reported in Nature, pangolins were not listed on the inventory of items being sold in Wuhan, although this omission could be deliberate as it’s illegal to sell them.“Whether the poor pangolin was the species at which it jumped, it’s not clear,” Turner says. “It’s either mixed in something else, mixed in a poor pangolin, or it’s jumped into people and evolved in people.”Prof Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney, was a co-author on a Nature study that examined the likely origins of the virus by looking at its genome. On social media he has stressed that the identity of the species that served as an intermediate host for the virus is “still uncertain”.One statistical study looked at a characteristic of the virus that evolved to enable it to latch on to human cells. Pangolins were able to develop this characteristic, but so were cats, buffalo, cattle, goats, sheep and pigeons.Another study claimed to have ruled out pangolins as an intermediary altogether, because samples of similar viruses taken from pangolins lacked a chain of amino acids seen in the virus now circulating in humans.The study Holmes worked on suggested that the scenario in which a human at the Wuhan market interacted with an animal that carried the virus was only one potential version of the Covid-19 origin story. Another was the possibility that a descendent of the virus jumped into humans and then adapted as it was passed from human to human.“Once acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it,” the study said.This might be another reason to doubt the established story.Prof Stanley Perlman, a leading immunologist at the University of Iowa and an expert on previous coronavirus outbreaks that have stemmed from animals, says the idea the link to the Wuhan market is coincidental “cannot be ruled out” but that possibility “seems less likely” because the genetic material of the virus had been found in the market environment.Perlman told  Australia he does believe there was an intermediary animal but adds that while pangolins are possible candidates, they “are not proven to be the key intermediary”.So-called wet markets – where live animals are traded – have been implicated in previous outbreaks of coronaviruses, in particular Sars.Dr Michelle Baker, an immunologist at CSIRO who studies viruses in bats, says some of the research on Covid-19’s origins have stepped off from what was known from the past.Baker says what is “very likely” is that the virus originated in a bat. “It’s a likely scenario but we will never know. The market was cleaned up quite quickly. We can only speculate.”“These wet markets have been identified as an issue because you do have species interacting,” she says. “It’s an opportunity to highlight the dangers of them and an opportunity to clamp down on them.”Turner adds: “We’ve found the ancestors of the virus, but having broader knowledge of the coronavirus in other species might give us a hint about the evolution of this thing and how it jumped.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de201cb39790a296e5569e7c681b9de94817e113/0_65_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aefaf1ddaffd2d2894273ba7478fe286","title":"iraq suspends reuters licence over report disputing coronavirus figures","story":"News agency’s licence revoked for three months over report that authorities said violated broadcasting rulesIraq has suspended the licence of the Reuters news agency after it published a story saying the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country was higher than officially reported.Iraq’s media regulator said it was revoking Reuters’ licence for three months and fining it 25m dinars ($21,000) for what it said was the agency’s violation of the rules of media broadcasting.In a letter to Reuters, the Communications and Media Commission (CMC) said it had taken the action “because this matter is taking place during current circumstances which have serious repercussions on societal health and safety.”Reuters said it regretted the Iraqi authorities’ decision and that it stood by the story, which it said was based on multiple, well-placed medical and political sources, and fully represented the position of the Iraqi health ministry.“We are seeking to resolve the matter and are working to ensure we continue to deliver trusted news about Iraq,” the news agency said in a statement.Asked about the Reuters suspension in an interview with Christiane Amanpour on CNN, Iraqi president Barham Salih said it was a “regrettable decision” taken by a commission that is independent of the government.“From my vantage point you would not get me in a situation where I would defend that. I’m working with our legal team in order to revoke that and manage the situation,” Salih said.He said the Reuters story had caused distress because it implied a deliberate falsification of records by the government, which he said had not been the case.The Reuters report, published on 2 April, cited three doctors involved in the testing process, a health ministry official and a senior political official as saying Iraq had thousands of confirmed Covid-19 cases, many times more than the 772 it had publicly reported at that time.The report was updated on 2 April to include a denial from a health ministry spokesman, sent by text message, who dismissed the sources’ assertions about the spread of the disease, describing them as “incorrect information“.In addition to the three-month suspension, Reuters was ordered to issue a formal apology.As of 13 April, Iraq had recorded 1,378 cases of Covid-19, including 78 deaths, according to the health ministry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3953dce05321f06873cd4f86b2c1c237af8c1fc6/0_114_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1faedcbeba1e32426076e32d62aa0bac","title":"subversive cult comic revived in spanish lockdown","story":"A cult comic from Spain’s 1970s counter-culture has been relaunched online to help relieve the tedium of the nation’s lockdown.The subversive comic El Víbora (The Viper) published 300 issues between 1979 and 2005 but now it’s back – briefly – by popular demand, according to the comic’s Barcelona-based publisher, Emilio Bernárdez.“It’s an act of solidarity with people who are bored at home,” Bernárdez said. “We wanted to do something. But we’re not health workers so this is what we came up with. We’re very close to our readers and so many of them asked us to revive El Víbora we decided to bring out a special issue that brings together our contributors’ favourite strips. The response from the cartoonists has been fantastic.”The comic was always subtitled Comix for Survivors, in reference to those who had lived through Spain’s 40-year dictatorship, which ended with the death of General Franco in 1975. The publication will reappear as The Viper for Survivors, this time referring to Covid-19.Most of the content will be recycled from past issues but the front cover features a newly commissioned cartoon by Aroha Travé bearing the slogan “Go fuck yourself, Covid-19”.Bernárdez explained that, although they will only publish one issue, which can be accessed for free, it won’t all be published at once.He said: “Altogether it may run to 300 pages but we will publish around 40 pages a week. There is so much material because so many contributors wanted to take part. There are also new works that are about coronavirus. We will publish every Wednesday until the end of the lockdown.”El Víbora played its part in Spain’s transition, not just from dictatorship to democracy but from sexual and cultural repression. Much of the counter-culture that emerged elsewhere in the 1960s was delayed by a decade in Spain, when it exploded in a frenzied and sometimes disastrous embrace of sex and drugs and rock’n’roll.One reader, Joan Fumaz, who was 17 when the comic produced its first edition, said: “To understand the impact of El Víbora you have to put yourself in the skin of an adolescent of that time.“Sex was taboo but I could buy this comic that had stuff about junkies, prostitutes and transvestites. It opened our eyes. We all read El Víbora, we all smoked weed, but we still had to go to Mass every Sunday and kiss the priest’s ring and be told we weren’t old enough to make our own decisions.“I think my first decision before I became an adult was to buy El Víbora.”Gina Rosquelles, who was 20 at the time, said: “El Víbora was a transgressive publication. It had the air of something not exactly fresh but really different. It was a real break from tradition and also carried a lot of suggestive images.”The comic followed in the tradition of the underground comic movement in the US and UK. Leading cartoonists of the American movement, such as Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton, were among El Víbora’s contributors. Crumb has donated a cartoon for the coronavirus issue.“All subversive comics in Spain today owe something to El Víbora,” claims Bernárdez.At its peak, the comic had a monthly circulation of 80,000 copies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

The country is at a “delicate and critical point” in its response to the coronavirus outbreak, according to Liz Canavan the assistant general secretary at the Department of the Taoiseach. Many people have fallen ill and too many have died and while there is some optimism that the Republic may not be hit as hard by Covid-19 as Italy, Spain and the UK, it is still too early to say what may happen in the weeks ahead.What are the numbers?On Tuesday, April 14th, 41 more people were reported to have died from coronavirus in the Republic taking the total number of fatalities to 406 while the number of known cases reached 11,479. Modelling data used by the National Public Health Emergency Team shows the daily growth rate has fallen from 33 per cent in the early stages of the outbreak to 9 per cent this week.What is happening in Northern Ireland?Ten more coronavirus-related deaths were announced in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, bringing the total number of fatalities to 134. On the same day a total of 1,967 cases had been identified in the North.How is the Republic doing when it comes to testing?Testing and contact tracing in real time – between 24 and 48 hours – is needed to fully contain the disease, experts have said. Minister for Health Simon Harris has said the mantra is to “test, test, test”. There have been widely reported shortages of testing kits and lab supplies and the waiting times for results, according to the Department of Health, was about seven to 10 days. But things have improved.HSE chief executive Paul Reid said a backlog in testing had been reduced from a high point of about 35,000 people waiting for results to some 11,000. He told a briefing in Dublin on Tuesday that 25 laboratories were now being used to examine Covid-19 tests, including 20 in hospitals, the national lab in UCD, a Department of Agriculture facility and in Germany. Mr Reid said nearly 8,000 tests were completed on Saturday. “That backlog will continue to be reduced and will be reduced completely by the end of this week,” he said.How does that compare with elsewhere in the world?Mr Reid, has said that Ireland is a “top-tier” country although that claim has been disputed by some. Dr Sean L’Estrange, a social scientist in UCD, has conducted a comparative analysis of reported testing figures. “It is difficult to support the claim that Ireland’s testing practice for Covid-19 is in the top tier in the world,” he wrote this week. “Ireland is not doing badly and it is certainly not amongst the worst in the world by any stretch of the imagination. Yet compared with other similar-sized and resourced states in the European context, its performance is decidedly middling,” he wrote.How important is the testing?If you have symptoms, it may not matter all that much. If you become sick enough to be hospitalised, you will get a fast-track result but if not, you stay at home and self-isolate until the symptoms lift. The reason testing really matters is that it is a key part of relaxing restrictions. Building a system that can turn around results, and fast, is key, according to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan. “We need to have a contact-tracing capacity and testing capacity to give us real-time – in other words same-day or following-day – results,” he said.Speaking of testing, will the Leaving and Junior Certificate exams go ahead?Last week, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the State exams would go ahead “by hook or by crook” and so they will or at least one set will. It was confirmed on Friday that the Leaving Cert would take place in late July or August. The Junior Cert, meanwhile, is set to be replaced by school-based exams which will run early in the new school year.The changes mean tens of thousands of students who are due to progress to third level and further education are likely to commence their courses much later than originally planned. Deadlines for students to complete practicals and project work in a number of subjects such as history, geography and home economics will also be extended until late July. Students had been given a deadline of May 15th to complete this work. While the move will bring much-needed clarity to students over contingency plans for the Leaving Cert, it is likely to be a major disappointment for many students who now face an extended summer preparing for the exams.Movement is still seriously restricted, what powers do gardaí have to enforce this?At the beginning of last week, Mr Harris signed regulations granting powers of enforcement to gardaí. The powers were passed by the Oireachtas in late March but became active only with the Minister’s signature. The regulations are based on the guidelines issued by the Government two weeks ago and anyone exercising more than 2km from their home or with people from outside their household will be in breach of the law. Anyone travelling beyond 2km for non-essential reasons will also be in breach. An offence will be committed only if a person refuses a direction from a garda to comply with the regulations. It is not the breaching of regulations that is illegal, but disobeying the garda’s instructions once caught.Will there be many arrests?Front-line gardaí have been instructed to use a four-step “graduated policing response” in the days ahead and should give members of the public “every opportunity” to comply with the regulations.“Enforcement will be a last resort and only when all other avenues have been exhausted in most cases,” an internal Garda document says. Before resorting to arrest, gardaí must go through the four-step escalation process termed “Engage, Explain, Encourage, Enforce”. Engage involves asking people their name and address, reason for travel and if they are aware of the restrictions. Gardaí may arrest anyone who refuses to give their name and address. If required they then move on to the “explain” stage, which involves highlighting the risks of breaking the rules. They must then “encourage” those in breach to stay at home “to save lives”. The final step, “enforce”, involves using Garda powers to discourage further non-compliance. This should be done only when “necessary and proportionate”.How was the bank holiday weekend?There was a “very high level of compliance” with restrictions on non-essential travel over the bank holiday weekend, according to Ms Canavan. A major policing operation was put in place over the Easter bank holiday with checkpoints across the country to ensure people complied with public health guidelines, over fears people would travel to holiday homes due to the fine weather.And were there many arrests?If I got Covid-19 can I get it again? No one knows for certain what level of immunity those who have had and then recovered from the illness will have. “We simply don’t know yet what it takes to be effectively protected from this infection,” Dawn Bowdish, a professor of pathology and molecular medicine in Ontario told Scientific American this week.What we do know is that immunity to other coronaviruses, including the common cold, can start declining within weeks of infection.No, but studies of Sars-CoV – the virus that causes Sars, which shares a lot of the same elements as Covid-19 – suggest that immunity peaks at around four months and offers protection for roughly two to three years. That would give time for a vaccine to be developed without those with the Covid-19 antibodies becoming reinfected.Are more young people dying from the illness than expected?The early narrative was that Covid-19 was an illness that largely spared young and healthy people but as it has spread across the world, it has shown itself to be more indiscriminate than many health experts initially thought. As it stands in Ireland more than 90 per cent of the victims have been over 65. While older people and those with pre-existing conditions are most at risk, it has occasionally hit young and apparently fit people including healthcare workers exposed to those with the virus. The youngest person to die so far was aged 30, the oldest was 105 years.Sometimes previously undiagnosed conditions are later revealed and sometimes there are no such explanations.What are the scientists saying? There have been many theories circulating in medical and scientific circles. There is a school of thought which suggests that a huge dose may hit people much harder than smaller doses while another school of thought points to genetic susceptibility with some people more vulnerable to the virus than others, irrespective of their age. “It is very possible that some of us could have a particular genetic make-up that makes it more likely that we will respond badly to an infection with this coronavirus,” virologist Michael Skinner at Imperial College London told the  newspaper this week.“A person with a high viral load has more virus particles than one with a low load,” said virologist Alison Sinclair at Sussex university. “We do not yet know what impact viral load has on the symptoms of a person infected with Covid-19. Whether there is a link between a high viral load and worse outcomes is going to be important to find out.”What has been happening in nursing homes in Ireland?The number of coronavirus infection clusters in nursing homes around the country has reached 149, according to the latest detailed figures on coronavirus cases released by State officials. Nursing homes now account for one-third of the clusters of infection across the country. This is incredibly serious not only because of the vulnerability of those in such care settings. It has become clear that Covid-19 has virus loads which are three times what might be found with other respiratory viruses such as flu, including in older patients, who are more contagious than expected.It is very significant. “These are the highest viral loads for any virus I know,” Prof Marc Van Ranst at the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Leuven, Belgium, said this week. He said he was astonished at the number of the germs he saw from patient throat samples in his lab. Especially surprising, he said, was that elderly people harbour prodigious quantities of virus.What else have we learned in recent days?The virus is also abundant in the throats of younger patients according to viral counts reported in the science journal Nature. Nine young to middle-aged office workers near Munich, Germany, who showed mild flu-like symptoms, had their nose and throat swabbed daily and spit samples collected for viral counts. “We detected Sars-CoV-2 in enormous amounts in the upper respiratory tract,” said Prof Clemens Wendtner, who led the research in Germany – 1,000 times more than for Sars. “This was shocking news.”All nine patients showed a high rate of viral replication and shedding in their throat during their first week of infection. The virus does not need to travel to the lungs to replicate, and is abundant in the throat, making it easy to pass on. “It can be spread easily by sneezing or coughing,” said Prof Wendtner.“The viral loads that people encounter when someone coughs in their general direction,” are so high, said Prof Van Ranst, that it makes transmission likely to happen. “Compared to other respiratory viruses, this is remarkable,” he added. It also meant it was easier for those with even mild symptoms to contaminate surfaces.The Nature paper confirms that “for the milder form of the disease, it doesn’t go as far as the lungs, but stays in the throat”, said immunologist Prof Luke O’Neill of Trinity College Dublin. “It means it is very transmissible just by talking. You don’t need to cough,” he said. Also, people without symptoms, “are very infectious,” he added. “Sars never infected the throat. Went straight to the lungs. So that’s a big difference,” he explained.Are men more likely to die than women?The short answer is yes. With the worldwide death toll closing in on 130,000 it has become clear that men are much more likely to die from coronavirus than women. Charity Global Health 5050, which campaigns for gender equality in health, has been tracking the breakdown internationally for deaths from the virus. In every country that publishes the data, significantly more men than women have died.In Italy, which has the highest number of deaths from the disease, men account for 58 per cent of all hospitalised cases and 72 per cent of all deaths. In Spain, men account for 59 per cent of all hospital admissions, 72 per cent of intensive care unit admissions and 65 per cent of all deaths. In China, where the virus first started, 64 per cent of fatalities have been men.In the Republic men account for less than half (45 per cent) of all confirmed cases, but 71 per cent of deaths.Ireland’s deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said there were a number of hypotheses as to why this phenomenon was happening. “It is either biology or behaviour or a mixture of both,” he said. “In some countries significantly greater proportions of men smoke. The activity of smoking is often associated with touching your face.” Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland professor of medicine Sam McConkey believes the reasons may be more general.“It’s just speculation, but I’m happy to speculate that men in general do not look after themselves,” he said. “We drink too much and we smoke too much and we do not go to the doctor. Women are much better at getting proper diagnosis and taking the proper tablets.”How long will the restrictions be in place?As it stands the restrictions on movement and social and commercial life in the country will remain in place until May 5th but even then we are only likely to see a partial lifting of the strict regime and that is contingent on the rate of infections continuing to fall.Senior Government officials have begun to work on plans for a “phased” exit from the lockdown with the priorities expected to include the reopening of more retail businesses, construction and maybe schools – although that might only be for some classes and for a portion of the week only.When the time comes for restrictions to be eased they will be lifted in “reverse order” with movement and retail looked at first.Dr Cillian De Gascun, chairperson of the coronavirus expert advisory group, has warned against complacency about the dangers of Covid-19 because “given the opportunity this virus will run rampant” and he warned that “we are not going to return to a normal state of affairs” soon.What else in being considered to bring the pandemic under control here?Prof McConkey has said the Government was at a crossroads and was faced with two decisions on treating Covid-19. The first option would to continue efforts to flatten the curve over a period of six to nine months while the second choice is “more severe” and would see a “short, sharp response” to try to prevent the spread of the virus entirely in Ireland. This move would require a 32-county approach.“It would be challenging. It would mean restricting travel and quarantining people coming into the country,” Prof McConkey said. “I feel it has to be a national decision, we would have to get Northern Ireland to go with us on this journey. It would have to be an all-island approach. It needs national discussion and involve all the parties in Northern Ireland.” This is the approach being adopted in countries such as South Korea and New Zealand.Will the virus diminish as the summer approaches and temperatures climb?Why are some people so infectious and what are superspreaders?One of the questions scientists have been asking as the virus continues to spread is if some people are more infectious than others and the answer appears to be yes. There do seem to be superspreaders, a loosely defined term for people who infect a disproportionate number of others, whether as a consequence of genetics, social habits or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. There are also people who are infected but unlikely to spread the infection.Two factors are at play, Martina Morris, emeritus professor of statistics and sociology at the University of Washington told the New York Times this week. “There has to be a link between people in order to transmit an infection,” she says. But, she adds, a link “is necessary but not sufficient”. The second factor is how infectious a person is. “We almost never have independent data on those two things.”“If you are the first person in a crowded room to get infected, and if this is an easily spread disease, you will look like a superspreader,” she says. “Anyone in that room could have had the same impact. You were just the first in line.”Dr Thomas Frieden, former director of the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said superspreading events may involve people with symptoms that linger but who are not sick enough to stay at home. Or they could involve infected people who shed an unusual amount of virus.People have been attacking 5G masts?There was a suspected arson attack on two large telecommunications masts in Co Donegal over the bank holiday weekend. Conspiracy theorists have linked new 5G technology to the cause of the global pandemic. The Government here and governments across the EU have all stressed there is absolutely no link between 5G and Covid-19.What is happening on the economic front? The coronavirus pandemic has brought the global economy to its knees and is likely to result in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said. In its latest world economic outlook report, it said it expects the global economy to “contract sharply” by 3 per cent in 2020 with the euro zone, the epicentre of the pandemic for the past month, experiencing a much sharper 7.5 per cent contraction.Its outlook for Ireland is slightly better though still grim. It expects the economy to contract by 6.8 per cent this year, less severe than the Central Bank projection for an 8 per cent contraction. The IMF expects the Irish economy to bounce back strongly next year, expanding by 6.3 per cent, against a euro-zone average of 4.7 per cent. However, unemployment could prove trickier to ease. The IMF says the jobless rate in Ireland will rise to an average of 12 per cent in 2020, up from a low of 4.8 per cent in February, and will stay elevated at almost 8 per cent in 2021.What are the unemployment figures in Ireland?There are 533,000 people registered for the €350 weekly Covid-19 unemployment benefit payment which was introduced in the wake of huge job losses. The take up of a temporary wage subsidy scheme for businesses was “continuing to grow,” and in total €199 million has been paid out under the scheme to date.What is being done to aid European economies?A €500 billion deal was reached between EU finance ministers last week. It has several elements. There is the employment guarantee scheme recently invented by the European Commission. If member states put up 25 per cent collateral, they can get a slice of loans raised by the commission on the market. This would be used to subsidise companies to keep employees on the books. The scheme would be worth a maximum of €100 billion.There are also loans from the European Investment Bank to support companies: €25 billion of extra guarantees, so it can step up lending by €200 billion.But the biggest chunk is from the EU’s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, which was created to dig out states during the euro zone debt crisis. States can borrow up to 2 per cent of their GDP, with a total of €240 billion available. Usually, taking loans from the ESM comes with the requirement to balance the books – known as “reforms” by supporters, “austerity” by critics.This time, borrowing will come without these strict conditions as long as the money is solely for responding to the pandemic and relates directly or indirectly to health spending.The European Commission says the new deal should be seen in the context of various other measures, particularly the decision by the European Central Bank to throw off prior restraints to print money, by buying government bonds to keep EU countries liquid. Finance ministers and the commission have also agreed to relax the usual budget rules to give states free rein to spend and support companies, and freed up existing unused funds from the EU budget to be used to respond to the crisis.What is the Irish Government saying about the deal?Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has said the Government may need limited access to the new European Union Covid-19 rescue package to help fund the wage subsidy scheme and support companies in difficulty.Mr Donohoe has expressed confidence that the country “can create a new economy” and create new services to recover and move forward, but he cautioned, “we have a journey ahead of us”.The new welfare supports will be monitored and may need to be strengthened to aid the recovery as at least 200,000 workers access the wage subsidy scheme. The Minister said it was possible that Ireland would need to access funds from the European Investment Bank to help fund companies and will consider whether to access the programme to help fund wage subsidy schemes. It is hoped that Ireland will not need to use the fund from the European Stability Mechanism, he added.What are other people saying?Alan Ahearne, the professor of economics at NUI Galway said the rescue package was a positive outcome, but warned that the figure needed was likely to increase. Prof Aherne said that as it stands Ireland will not need to borrow from the European Stability Mechanism’s new low-cost loan fund, as the European Central Bank keeps borrowing costs close to zero. He said he was “cautiously optimistic” the recovery would be “much, much quicker than a usual recession” given the welfare supports that have been put in place.Is China over the crisis now?No one thinks the crisis is over in any country in the world. However, the country where the first cases of the virus were recorded more than 100 days ago has made substantial progress in recent days. It reported zero new coronavirus deaths on one day last week for the first time since it started publishing daily figures in January. That is a milestone that offers grounds for some relief as the country works to stave off a second wave and struggles with ongoing outbreaks in Wuhan. The National Health Commission reported 32 new cases across China on Tuesday, all of them imported infections, bringing the number of cases involving overseas travellers to 983.Are EU countries about to ease restrictions?Some EU countries are easing some restrictions or at least they will in the days ahead. In Denmark, there is what has been described as a “cautious reopening”, starting with daycare and primary schools opening. The Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen has described the process as “a bit like walking the tightrope”. In Austria, small shops, hardware and gardening stores have been allowed to reopen under certain conditions with all retailers likely to follow from May 1st. Spain and Italy have also started to partially lift restrictions.The European Commission has urged all EU states to co-ordinate as they begin to ease lockdown measures, warning that failure to do so could result in new spikes of the epidemic.In a set of recommendations to be adopted this week, the commission said: “It is time to develop a well co-ordinated EU exit strategy. The exit strategy should be co-ordinated between the member states, to avoid negative spillover effects.”And when will it all end allowing normality to be restored?No one can answer that question with any confidence but it is unlikely that all restrictions will be lifted for several months and the aftershocks, in terms of public health, economic life and social activities will be felt for a lot longer than that.While Mr Harris has raised the prospect of easing some restrictions, he warned: “There isn’t going to be a magic point at the start of May where life as we knew it before the coronavirus can resume. I think, being truthful, social distancing is going to remain a very big part of life not just in Ireland but the world over until we get to a vaccine or effective treatment for the coronavirus.”He said the key indicators to watch in the coming weeks would be the rate of growth of the virus, the average number of people in intensive care units and the reproductive rate of the virus, which measures how many people each infected person is likely to pass the virus on to.Conor Pope is Consumer Affairs Correspondent and Pricewatch EditorEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4229361.1586932219!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus quest diagnostics says it has cleared us covid 19 test backlog","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tQuest Diagnostics has been facing criticism in the United States over a backlog of coronavirus tests it is processingQuest Diagnostics, the US laboratory previously embroiled in the CervicalCheck controversy, has been facing criticism in the United States over a backlog of coronavirus tests it is processing. New Jersey-based Quest, one of the CervicalCheck labs, has been criticised for a backlog of coronavirus tests in the United States that had reached a high point of 160,000 in late March. In a statement on Monday the company said it had eliminated the backlog and had capacity to process 45,000 tests a day. The lab had completed some 800,000 Covid-19 tests and had a turnaround time of less than 24 hours for priority patients, and on average less than two days for other samples, the company said. The lab, and the wider testing regime in the United States, had come in for criticism from medics and the media over lengthy delays of up to ten days for tests to be processed. Quest began testing for Covid-19 in mid-March across 12 of its US labs, but it developed a significant backlog as demand substantially increased. The lab was facing a backlog of 160,000 tests to be processed by March 25th by the start of this month the company said it had cut down to 115,000. One week later the company said it had cut waiting times for tests to be processed down from its peak to approx two to three days, and the backlog had been reduced to 80,000 tests, before being fully cleared on Monday. The majority of testing under the cervical cancer screening programme in Ireland had been outsourced by the Health Service Executive to Quest and MedLab Pathology, with a lab in the Coombe hospital processing a smaller number of smears. The screening programme was engulfed in a major controversy after it was revealed smear tests that failed to pick up abnormalities were found to be incorrect, following audits after women were later diagnosed with cancer. The controversy was exposed during a court case in 2018 taken by Vicky Phelan and in total more than 200 women were affected by the scandal.The Irish Covid-19 testing system has been struggling to deal with a significant backlog of tests in recent weeks, with people waiting up to two weeks to receive the results of swabs. The testing backlog has been reduced from a high point of around 35,000 people waiting for results to some 11,000, the HSE’s chief executive, Paul Reid, said on Monday. Over 72,000 tests have been completed to date between 25 laboratories, including a German lab contracted to help the HSE clear the backlog. On average 2,800 tests are now being processed a day, although the system reached a high point in processing 7,900 tests on Saturday. It is expected the rest of the backlog will be cleared by the end of this week, with current demand for tests at around 1,200 per day.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4229018.1586896516!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ff and fg agree historic policy document for coalition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar met Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin on Tuesday to sign off on the framework document.

Party votes on the proposals are unlikely to be held until a full programme for government is agreed in the coming weeks.There is also an understanding that Fianna Fáil will hold the role of taoiseach in the first period of government. Discussions around other senior ministerial positions have also been held.Green Party TD Neasa Hourigan has said her party will carefully examine the proposals but indicated that clear timelines must be placed on all commitments.“We are keeping our minds open. Let’s read it and go through it and take it from there,” she said.Co-leader of the Social Democrats Catherine Murphy said she would take some time to consider the framework although party sources played down any potential involvement in government formation talks. The Labour Party has said it wants to go into opposition although there is understood to be a “growing minority” who believe exploratory talks should be held in the coming weeks.Party membersIn a message sent to members of the Fine Gael parliamentary party on Tuesday, chairman Martin Heydon wrote: “The Taoiseach has asked me to inform the parliamentary party that he met Micheál Martin earlier today and that they have agreed a policy framework document that could form the basis for a programme for government. “They reaffirmed their commitment to forming a majority government of three or more partiesgroups that will last five years with full and equal partnership between FG and FF at its centre.”In an identical statement both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil said: “Both leaders met this morning and agreed the framework document. Both leaders will brief their respective parliamentary parties tomorrow.”Separately the Fine Gael party has identified “seven tests” that any future coalition must pass if a government is to be formed.The first priority will be that nothing should distract “from the central task of protecting our people during the present Covid-19 crisis”.The party has said that a new social contract must be developed “which embraces all sectors and communities and responds to the new risks and costs of living which are creating concern in people’s lives”.This will include “a clear contract for the young who have borne many burdens in recent years”.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe  It is a measure of the times we live in that the announcement of the agreement by the leaders of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to bring proposals for coalition to their parties was the second, third or fourth item on news bulletins last night.No need to say what came before it. Yet the agreement by Leo Varadkar and Micheál Martin yesterday – albeit only the latest of a series of slow steps towards the goal of a “grand” coalition – is a truly historic move, a testament to how much Irish politics has changed and is changing before our eyes.Neither party likes it much that is the truth. They can see the electoral pitfalls, like everyone else. Martin in particular will face some difficult battles with his party to secure its agreement, though he would not be promoting something he did not believe could gain acceptance, and that means that Fianna Fáil expects to occupy the Taoiseach’s office first. Other key aspects of how the government will work, including at the very centre, must also have been agreed.To many on the outside, this will appear as a last desperate bid by the old duopoly to keep their grip on power. Inside, it will look very different. It will look like a historic compromise, putting aside of age-old differences in the public interest. Never mind for a moment that those differences are less visible to the outside to the two parties, those differences matter. Their leaders will present it as a political sacrifice – perhaps of their parties – in the public interest. Take them at their word if you like, or don’t. Either way, my guess is they will be judged on their deeds, and on their results in government.All those who voted for “change” (whatever it meant to them) at the February election will complain that the FF-FG alliance is cheating the country of the change it demanded that will be a cacophonous chorus indeed. Were they minded to take a broader view, the change-istas could equally interpret it as evidence of the revolution they have wrought on Irish politics in the 2020 election. The last redoubt of the old system has fallen.Depending on where you stand, the substance of the agreement between the two parties is more important than the symbolism. What the new government does, after all, is less important than who is in it.‘Substantial change’There is little to go on, ahead of the presentation of the agreed principles to the respective parliamentary parties today. There will be fine words about a new approach – “a very substantial change”, according to one person involved – to health and housing, to climate action, and “a new agenda for public service”.It identifies a number of “missions” for the next government, and promises a “new social contract”.It will, in the words of another person involved in the process, be “more left-wing than the Sinn Féin manifesto”, but will contain little by way of specifics about how to achieve its goals – “or how to pay for them”, says another source.This is partly because that minor detail has yet to be figured out. But it is also designed to leave room for the three smaller parties – the Greens, Social Democrats and Labour – to shape the eventual detailed programme, if they can be persuaded to join the talks. Though there is little expectation in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil that they will.Instead, the two old parties are likely to find themselves explaining why they continue to exclude Sinn Féin from a government that draws on so many of that party’s policies. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will not bend on that, though. It means that if they are to do this thing, they will likely do it alone.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4228963.1586893057!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"governments across europe examining how to exit lockdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA customer  in a  book store  after the Austrian government loosened its lockdown restrictions. Photograph: ReutersGovernments across Europe are examining how to ease out of lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus while minimising the risks of new outbreaks.Austria, France and Denmark have announced plans to gradually reopen some schools, shops and businesses, and EU health ministers are to meet in video conference on Wednesday to discuss how to co-ordinate their next steps.The European Commission is expected to announce guidelines on how to manage the exits from lockdown on Wednesday, with a “road map” of recommendations so that member states that share open borders can have consistent policies.The guidelines are expected to lay out criteria for how member states should evaluate when reopening is appropriate, and emphasise the importance of co-ordination with neighbouring countries. However, they steer clear of recommending courses of action.The launch of the document was delayed amid concerns from states that talk of ending lockdowns was premature.“It is up to member states. It is their prerogative to determine when they want to take restrictive measures and when they want to move out of restrictive measures,” a commission spokesman said.“What we have been working on over the past weeks is a road map with recommendations to ensure that when they start to move out of these restrictive measures they do so in a manner that is effective, including and in particular taking into account obviously the situation in other EU countries.”“In particular, cross-border regions need to take into account for obvious reasons the situation just across the border if they want their measures to be effective,” the spokesman added.Across Europe some political factions and businesses have been calling for lockdowns to be eased to limit the economic damage of the pandemic, and there is concern about how long citizens will endure the restrictions, especially as the weather gets warmer.Any steps towards reopening are likely to be accompanied by a range of hygiene measures, including distancing, increased cleaning and in some countries a requirement to wear face masks.Education ministers from across the EU met over video conference on Tuesday, and discussed how states were managing remote education and plans to reopen schools.Schools in Portugal and Malta are shut until at least after the summer, and in some countries until further notice. Half of EU member states are considering reopening some schools by the end of May.Croatia’s science and education minister Blazenka Divjak said: “When schools are reopening in some countries, decisions are not to open all schools but to have some schedule how to do it.“The issue is also how to guide schools and universities how to have precautionary mechanisms, and support them in building a safe environment.”FRANCEPresident Emmanuel Macron stressed that France’s reopening on May 11th is conditional on further progress against the epidemic, and that it would be gradual.The reopening of “creches, schools, colleges and lycées” is Macron’s first priority. Universities will not reopen “before summer”.Many teachers had believed that school would not resume until next September. Teachers’ unions have accused the government of sacrificing them to relaunch economic activity.Education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer stressed that “everybody will not go back at the same time”, and said priority would be given to students in disadvantaged areas.Factories that make essential items such as surgical masks and ventilators have dramatically increased production under lockdown, but most industry and the construction sector are almost at a standstill. Employers are required to respect rules on social distancing and sanitation.The government will draw up more detailed plans for reopening the economy over the next two weeks. The business management group Medef says working hours should be increased and paid holidays reduced to help the recovery.Shops selling food and drink, food delivery services, pharmacies and newspaper stands are the only retail businesses that have been allowed to remain open during the lockdown.“On May 11th we will allow most people to return to work, restart our industry, our shops and services,” Macron said.Trade unions and management are together drawing up lists of those who may reopen. Public gathering places, including restaurants, cafes, hotels, cinemas, theatres and museums, “will remain shut at this stage”, Macron said.AUSTRIAQueues formed outside Austrian garden centres and hardware stores on Tuesday as the country, one of the first to restrict public life, became one of Europe’s first to ease lockdown measures.Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the liberalisation was possible because people had restricted their movements in recent months and adhered to the week-old obligation to wear face masks in shops and – from Tuesday – on public transport and in taxis.“This is a first step in the direction of opening that’s become possible,” said Kurz in Vienna. “We’re following our schedule, but if the numbers go into the wrong direction again we’ll use the emergency brake.”All stores with less than 400sq m floor space are open as of Tuesday, alongside hardware stores and garden centres. Face masks are still mandatory, as are access restrictions to ensure stores don’t become overcrowded and breach social distancing rules.If infection growth remains below 3 per cent per day in a week’s time, Austrian authorities say other stores and shopping centres will reopen on May 2nd and hotels and restaurants mid-May. Public events are banned until the end of June at the earliest.Construction has continued after a brief interruption, while factories never closed. Companies are struggling to survive, and state wage support costs for more than 600,000 jobs are now up to €5 billion.Schools remain closed and are unlikely to reopen before mid-May, though state “Matura” school-leaving exams will go ahead.SPAINSpain has been in a tightly controlled lockdown for a month, and the government has said it is likely to be extended at last until mid-May. However, this week non-essential workers have been allowed to return to their workplaces, a measure that affects sectors such as the building industry, manufacturing and other heavy industry.Although those sectors have broadly welcomed the lifting of the restriction, there has been some frustration at a perceived lack of clarity regarding the new circumstances. Construction companies, for example, have been told not to work or use communal areas in buildings close to residents, causing some confusion.The return to work of these Spaniards has caused an increase in the use of public transport, with the Madrid region seeing an 11 per cent rise in demand compared to last week. Police and security guards have been handing out face masks to commuters at bus and train stations.With schools still closed, the government has not yet announced how this academic year will end or be evaluated, and education minister Isabel Celaá is due to discuss the issue with regional governments this week.A group of education experts has started a campaign to persuade the government to open schools in the summer in order to help pupils study subjects in which they have fallen behind or take part in extra-curricular activities.The government’s head of health emergencies, Fernando Simón, has said he does not favour lifting restriction of movement for children yet, as some politicians have been demanding.ITALYItaly was the first EU country to go into lockdown, imposing national movement restrictions on March 9th. With the economy reeling, some politicians and businesses are calling for a return to normality, and the government has set up a task force to examine how to gradually allow daily activities to resume.Last week the government announced that the lockdown would be extended to May 3rd, but that a handful of businesses would be allowed to reopen. Bookshops, stationary shops and shops that sell children’s clothes are allowed to open from Tuesday, as long as they maintain strict hygiene rules and stagger customer entries. Some hard-hit regions in the north are to keep them closed.Schools are not expected to open until September, after the summer holidays. Under consideration for the next phase of reopening are some pillars of Italian industry, including car-making, metallurgy and fashion. Whenever it happens, businesses are likely to be required to implement hygiene precautions.Government ministers have suggested that flexible hours and working from home should be considered to prevent overcrowding of public transport.There is ision among sport authorities about when football matches can be played again, and as the weather heats up there is discussion on how to manage the annual migration of Italians out of cities to the coasts during the summer.GERMANYChancellor Angela Merkel will discuss Germany’s exit from lockdown measures on Wednesday with regional leaders. Amid growing disagreement on the approach and timetable, and with competences ided between federal and state level, the end of emergency measures is likely to be as confused and piecemeal as their beginning.Germany’s centre for disease control announced a slowing of the pandemic on Monday – 2,000 new cases in a day, down from twice that a week ago – but as yet no sign of a clear drop. More than 68,000 people have recovered from the virus, more than half of the 125,000 registered cases, and hospitals have considerable intensive bed capacity.“The measures taken are having an effect,” said Prof Lothar Wieler of the Robert Koch Institute. “The discipline we have held in the last weeks should hold a bit longer.”All schools and colleges remain closed, along with childcare, for the foreseeable future. An expert report for the government on Monday urged a “realistic” timetable to get schools open again “as soon as possible”, starting with the primary sector. Education is a competence of federal states, not Berlin, so staggered, regional solutions are likely.On Tuesday, the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, home to one in five Germans, said it was aiming to reopen kindergartens and primary schools by April 20th.A survey for the Bild tabloid found 43 per cent of parents favoured cancelling school holidays to allow children make up lost lesson time.There is no indication as to when non-essential retail and services can reopen. Again this is a competence of federal states, in agreement with inidual municipalities, so a heterogeneous pattern is likely. While construction and production has continued where site managers can guarantee social distancing, most factories are shuttered.Many large companies have closed production facilities as much due to delivery shortages and a drop in demand as the virus. Volkswagen is planning to ramp up production again on April 20th.CZECH REPUBLICThe Czech Republic closed its borders, schools, pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops in mid-March, and made it mandatory to wear a face mask in public spaces. Officials say the coronavirus outbreak is now under control, and the country registered just 68 new cases on Tuesday – the lowest daily rise since March 17th.Bicycle shops, DIY stores and craft markets reopened last Thursday, and the government is discussing whether to allow a broader range of shops to resume trading soon. However, officials are concerned by evidence of more people breaking social distancing and mask-wearing rules over the Easter weekend.The Hyundai car factory in the Czech town of Nosovice restarted limited production on Tuesday, while Skoda workers are expected to return to work on April 27th. TPCA, a Toyota-Peugeot joint venture, plans to restart on May 4th.Many construction firms have not officially halted work, but they are operating under strict social distancing guidelines. Some are reporting problems in sourcing materials and workers, including migrants after many returned home to Ukraine and elsewhere.The government initially forecast that Czech schools could reopen fully in mid-May, but given signs of widespread public opposition – including a petition that quickly garnered 80,000 signatures – such a move is now considered unlikely.Health officials say that if experts do deem it safe to reopen schools and colleges, their priority will be students in their final years who are due to sit important exams this summer.DENMARKDanish prime minister Mette Frederiksen promised to expedite easing of coronavirus restrictions thanks to infection numbers that are “better than we would have dared hope for”.On Monday, she said health authorities had noted a significant drop in hospitalisations and had given her government the green light for the country’s reopening to be “a little bit bigger”.“This will, of course, be done responsibly and carefully. The contract we ... entered together seems to have brought benefits. It also looks like it has worked.”Denmark has had nearly 6,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Of these, 2,515 people have recovered and 299 have died.Hospitals are once again taking in non-essential patients, and Danish doctors are begging patients with non-coronavirus symptoms to return.In schools all children under 12 will return to creche, kindergarten and primary school on Wednesday. Not all parents are pleased with this, and a new Facebook group – “My child will not be a Covid19 guinea pig – already boasts more than 35,000 members.Universities and secondary schools remain closed. State exams have been cancelled, and students will be awarded grade-average results.Manufacturing and construction continued largely uninterrupted during the Danish lockdown, as have factories if they could guarantee social distancing rules.Frederiksen gave no date for a reopening of retail, services and other non-essential businesses. She said just over half of these companies had continued working.On Tuesday evening she was to seek the views of all political parties on their reopening priorities, before consulting with medical experts on the next steps.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Donald Trump pulls World Health Organisation funding and accuses body of virus \u0026#39cover-up\u0026#39Wuhan hospitals overwhelmed with seriously ill patients only now able to ask for treatmentUK coronavirus lockdown: what does it mean and what are the rules?What is coronavirus, how did it start and how big could it get?How other countries are planning to end their coronavirus lockdownsWhich countries are under lockdown - and is it working?Politics latest: Lockdown \u0026#39mistakes\u0026#39 must not be repeated in exit strategy, Starmer saysWhat essential shops are open during the coronavirus lockdown?Can I drive during the lockdown?

Mr Frost self-isolated with the symptoms of the virus. The aim of tomorrow’s call is to agree a calendar for next steps in order to move the negotiations forward, a commission spokesman said.The Withdrawal Agreement provides for the possibility to extend the transition period by up to one to two years. We have always said that we are ready to discuss such an extension.Downing Street continues to maintain that the deadline will not be extended, despite the coronavirus outbreak paralysing intensive negotiations, and is enshrined in law. Any extension request must be made by July, according to the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement. Brussels is expected to agree to the delay but insists the UK must be the one to make the request. It will demand payment for the UK’s continued membership of the Single Market.EU diplomats have ruled out any hope of Britain negotiating a pay as you go month-by-month extension to the Brexit trade talks, which was an idea floated in Westminster over the weekend. This is a ridiculous idea, said one senior EU diplomat. It is against the Withdrawal Agreement and undermines legal certainty. It also makes it unpredictable for business.Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on Tuesday said he was confident that trade talks could reach a positive conclusion and insisted the government is committed to getting a trade deal with the EU. Mr Barnier and Mr Frost have discussed how talks could continue despite coronavirus, he added at Tuesday\u0027s daily press conference on the outbreak. The  understands the EU could agree to a flextension, where the extension falls away if the trade negotiations are completed ahead of time. EU sources said they thought a British request would only come at the last possible moment. “This is a decision which will be left for Boris Johnson and it is too early for him to make such a call,” one said. Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit Party, and Andrew Bridgen, the Brexiteer Tory MP, both told The  there should be no extension.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"diy stores introduce online queuing systems deal lockdown demand","story":"DIY stores have introduced online queuing systems to deal with demand during the lockdown, with customers reporting waits of more than an hour.Major retailers, including B\u0026ampQ and Wickes, have made the changes as sales have moved online with DIY stores temporarily closed.Shoppers also faced long queues over the Bank Holiday weekend when using new contact-free, “click and collect” points in the car parks of some retailers. Homebase said that, with stores temporarily closed, the firm is experiencing “extremely high demand” online. However, B\u0026ampQ said there had been no spike in demand for DIY overall, but that customers are “adapting to buying products in a different way” with demand shifting online.With DIY shops closed, some retailers have set up contact-free collection points in car parks with goods brought directly to customers’ cars.However, orders have been delayed and retailers asked customers to wait until their order had been confirmed as ready for collection before travelling to the store. The British Home Enhancement Trade Association, which represents manufacturers, said there had been reports of “Bank Holiday chaos” at some pick-up points with large numbers of cars arriving simultaneously to collect goods.A spokesman for B\u0026ampQ said: “B\u0026ampQ is experiencing extremely high demand at present, and so orders are taking up to a few days to process.“Customers need to wait until they receive confirmation that their order is ready for collection, and only then travel to their local B\u0026ampQ store car park, where their product will be brought directly to their car.”Those doing DIY should take extra care so as not to overburden the NHS with avoidable injuries, the health service warned last week.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt damon self isolating small irish town caught countrys lockdown","story":"He is one of Hollywood’s most famous stars, owner of the most expensive penthouse in Brooklyn, New York as well as a villa in Los Angeles, but Matt Damon has found himself isolating in the small Irish town of Dalkey after being caught up in Ireland’s coronavirus lockdown.The Academy Award winner, who starred in the Jason Bourne films, was filming Ridley Scott’s ‘The Last Duel’ when the lockdown was enforced, and he has not left the country since - much to the delight of locals.Damon, thought to be worth $160 million, has been welcomed into the community as one of their own, and before social distancing rules were imposed, had pictures taken in a pub, a cafe, a restaurant, on the seafront and on his morning run. He has also been spotted swimming in the Irish Sea near this affluent suburb of Dublin, where U2 frontman Bono has a house.“Matt Damon just jogged past me, going up Killiney Hill. He’s actually tall enough normally those lads are tiny,” one man told the Irish Mirror on March 31.In town, Ouzos Steak and Seafood posted a photo of Damon’s visit on their Facebook page, saying: “Thanks to Matt Damon for dropping into Ouzos Dalkey, Dublin, Ireland to approach our owner, Hicham Raouf to discuss his idea for another film here in Ireland.”Gail O’Connor wrote on Twitter: “Saw him in Dalkey couple weeks ago, was giving him the side eye I know him... look, he\u0027s looking at me, then a grin as he passed by.“I mean come on it\u0027s Matt Damon in Dalkey who\u0027s expecting that!”A photo of Damon carrying a SuperValu shopping bag (Ireland’s largest supermarket chain) received widespread acclaim, with the company posting: “Great choice, Matt” on social media.The 49-year-old has a wife and four daughters, and The  understands they are all self-isolating in Dalkey as the world is gripped by the coronavirus pandemic.Last month President Trump had initiated a travel ban between Ireland and the United States.Damon was in Ireland with Ben Affleck for the medieval drama based on the book The Last Duel: A True Story of Trial by Combat in Medieval France by Eric Jager, which explores the last officially recognised judicial duel fought in France.The pair won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Good Will Hunting, in 1998.Some commentators have suggested that Damon already has experience in dealing with global pandemics after he starred in Contagion, a 2011 film about a deadly virus which spread across the world, and is currently top of the download charts.In Ireland, 406 people have died from Coronavirus, while there are 11,479 cases.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one nine mortgage holders given repayment holiday","story":"One in nine mortgage holders have been granted a repayment holiday, new industry figures have revealed.More than 1.2 million payment breaks have been approved since banks and building societies agreed to offer a three-month holiday to anyone who is struggling financially because of the coronavirus outbreak.The figures, published yesterday by banking trade body UK Finance, show that the number of claimants is rising by 61,000 a day as more than a million households have been left unable to pay their mortgage.However, experts warned that interest is still due on the debt amid suggestions that some homeowners appear to be claiming a break unnecessarily.Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, said lenders had “pulled out all the stops” to hand out an “unprecedented” number of payment holidays in recent weeks.He added: “We understand that the current crisis is having a significant impact on household finances for people across the country. Lenders have a number of options available to help, and payment holidays aren’t always the right solution for everyone.”Robin Fieth, of the Building Societies Association, said building societies had granted almost a quarter of a million holidays to give “much needed breathing space to families whose household income is under severe pressure during the current crisis”.There are just under 11 million outstanding mortgages, meaning roughly 11 per cent of homeowners feel they are unable to meet their monthly payments. This is expected to rise as more customers see their income fall as jobs are lost or furloughed.UK Finance estimated that the average homeowner has deferred payments of £775 a month.Customers are asked to self-certify that they cannot afford to repay their loan, and some experts feared that some have applied without understanding the long-term impact on their finances.Interest charges will still accrue during the loan repayment holiday, meaning that customers will pay more in the long run.Analysis by Private Finance, a mortgage broker, suggested this could amount to around £2,000 more over the lifetime of the loan.Mark Harris, of SPF Private Clients, another broker, said: “Not all borrowers have been affected to the same extent by coronavirus so if you are able to do so, consider maintaining your mortgage payments at the usual level or making partial payments.”He also warned that furloughed households could find it harder to remortgage or take out a new loan as their income has fluctuated.Some lenders have tightened the rules on customers with a variable income, he said, and applicants will have to prove their income has gone back to normal.UK Finance also warned borrowers that they must get agreement from their bank instead of cancelling direct debits. Failing to get permission from a lender could result in a “missed payment” being added to a customer’s credit file, damaging their creditworthiness.Concerns have been raised about the long-term impact on household finances. At present, mortgage lenders are only able to offer a three-month break to customers. Several banks have tightened their mortgage terms in recent weeks to block customers with smaller deposits from taking out a loan. However, for the 1.2 million who have been given a payment holiday it has come as a welcome relief.Sarah Lawrence, 41, and her husband Sam, 39, were approved for a three-month repayment holiday by their lender HSBC very quickly after they applied.The couple live in Surrey, with their three children, Flyn, 12, Rowan, 10, and Annie, six. Mrs Lawrence, a freelance public relations consultant, said her income has fallen by a third since the crisis began, while her husband’s has fallen by a quarter.Although an above-average earner, Mrs Lawrence said the reduction in income had meant affording their £1,600-a-month mortgage was difficult.She said she should qualify for the Government’s support package for the self-employed and is waiting to hear from HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs. However, the support will not arrive until June, leaving her and her family reassessing their finances.“My clients have been brilliant,” she said. “I had really frank conversations with them and most of them said ‘we want to carry on as we are’. But if this goes on for a significant period of time there are no guarantees.“My clients are in the property sector and the market is pretty much on hold at the moment. They aren’t really operating, so it\u0027s hard.”She said that the terms of her mortgage allow for overpayments of 10 per cent a year, so the family is keeping money aside and hopes to be able to clear the amount within months of things returning to normal.UK Finance said those looking to apply for a payment holiday should do so online as telephone lines remain extremely busy.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pressure mounts re open primary schools may half term catastrophic","story":"The government is coming under mounting pressure to re-open primary schools before the May half term, as catastrophic Office for Budget Responsibility figures forecast the economy will shrink by 35 per cent due to the coronavirus lockdown.A number of ministers are understood to be agitating for younger pupils to return to the classroom as soon as May 11 amid fears the restrictions cannot feasibly be relaxed until workers\u0027 children are back in full-time education.It had previously been suggested that at the earliest, pupils would not be back until after the Whitsun half term, which begins on May 25, the late Spring bank holiday.It comes as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), the governments’ chief scientific advisers met on Tuesday to review the lockdown. The government is expected to extend the measures for a further three weeks on Thursday, taking the possible end date to May 7. One cabinet minister told The : “We have got to make sure this economic downturn is V-shaped and not L-shaped. We should be beginning to release the things that can be released - so primary schools should re-open and so should non-essential shops. If you can go into Sainsbury’s to buy non-essential items while observing social distancing rules, why can you not do that in other shops?”Dismissing fears that parents might be fearful of term time resuming for fear of their children inadvertently spreading the virus to grandparents, they added: “It looks like elderly and vulnerable people are going to be kept in self-isolation for six months rather than three.”Sir Iain Duncan Smith, former leader of the Conservative Party, agreed, saying: “Schools are important because they enable parents to go back to work, particularly primary schools because those are the children who are too young to be left at home alone. Re-opening primary schools is the key to unlocking labour.”Working in tandem with the Treasury, Downing Street is said to be formulating plans for a gradual easing of the restrictions on a sector-by-sector basis.But one Tory source said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson had been “flip-flopping’ on the issue of re-opening schools, saying: “He’s not really a decision maker. One minute he seems to believe schools should re-open but the next he’s being overly cautious. It’s hard to work out where he stands on it from one day to the next but he is having to balance a lot of competing interests.”On Tuesday, one teachers’ union wrote to the government claiming its members are ‘disturbed’ by suggestions schools could reopen.The letter to the Prime Minister from the National Education Union read: “Given that in re-opening schools and colleges, you would be asking our members to take an increased risk, we believe they have a right to understand fully how any such proposal belongs within an overall Government strategy to defeat the virus.”When Boris Johnson announced the lockdown on March 23, prompting GCSE and A-Level exams to be cancelled, it had been suggested that schools may not re-open until after the summer holidays in September.But calls for a sooner return have been fuelled by research by University College London which found keeping pupils off has had little impact, even with other lockdown measures.Recent modelling studies of Covid-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only two to four per cent of deaths, many fewer than other social distancing interventions. The government had expected 20 per cent of children to stay in schools after the lockdown was put in place, but actually just two per cent of vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers have carried on attending. A Number 10 insider said Mr Johnson’s gradual return to work following a week in intensive care, along with his chief adviser Dominic Cummings following his own coronavirus isolation “would have an impact on the dynamic of the lockdown”. The insider said: “Dom is worried about lifting the restrictions too early and Britain suffering a second Covid-19 wave in the autumn which could cause even greater economic damage.”However, another source pointed out that as a former advisor to Michael Gove when he was education secretary, Mr Cummings would “not have much truck with the teaching unions.”Another Tory source suggested that the government was “seriously considering” bringing in weekly reviews of the restrictions rather than the three-week assessments recommended by Public Health England (PHE). “They are going to keep this under a more regular review. You won’t see them referring to ending the lockdown but adapting it. They may extend for three weeks but that’s in name, really - you can redefine a lockdown in the middle of it.”A cabinet minister suggested that the ultimate decision would lie with Mr Johnson, who is currently convalescing at Chequers.“The Prime Minister is almost in the perfect position of being at Chequers and not at Downing Street so he can direct things and say what he wants without having to sit through boring meetings he has little patience for. He can focus on quality rather than quantity.”Insisting that Mr Johnson would continue to not only be led by the science but also the public mood, they added: “While children are still on their Easter holidays then support for the lockdown remains, but what really changes people’s minds is when their nextdoor neighbours start losing their jobs. They are seeing news of hundreds more ventilators coming in, of the Nightingale up and running and intensive care units coping. Lifting the lockdown will require an active decision by the PM but only when the public is ready for it.”A Government spokesperson said: “Schools will remain closed until further notice, except for children of critical workers and the most vulnerable children. We will only re-open schools when the scientific advice indicates it is safe to do so, and will work closely with the sector to agree our approach.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 15th april 2020","story":"Local residents use the community food larder in Muthill, near Crieff in Perthshire, which was set up using the old village phone box as a food collection and donation point as the UK continues in lockdown to help curb the spread of the coronavirusCoronavirus latest news: Donald Trump pulls World Health Organisation funding and accuses body of virus \u0026#39cover-up\u0026#39Wuhan hospitals overwhelmed with seriously ill patients only now able to ask for treatmentUK coronavirus lockdown: what does it mean and what are the rules?What is coronavirus, how did it start and how big could it get?How other countries are planning to end their coronavirus lockdownsWhich countries are under lockdown - and is it working?Politics latest: Lockdown \u0026#39mistakes\u0026#39 must not be repeated in exit strategy, Starmer saysWhat essential shops are open during the coronavirus lockdown?Can I drive during the lockdown?

I do not see anything in this paper to support this supposition and am concerned that this paper has been published in this journal.“I do not believe that any dog owners should be concerned as a result of this work.”Prof Xia acknowledged his theory was “speculative” as researchers do not have data on all species which could potentially have harboured the virus.He added transmission of coronavirus from the another species to a human\u0026nbspmust be a very rare event, otherwise there would be multiple outbreaks instead of a very local origin”.The conclusions of his\u0026nbspstudy, published in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution, centre on an antiviral protein in mammals – known as ZAP – which can stop a virus in its tracks by preventing its multiplication and degrading its genome.The protein targets a pair of chemical letters called CpG dinucleotides, but coronaviruses can fight back by reducing these signposts and rendering ZAP powerless.“Survival of the virus indicates that it has successfully evaded ZAP-mediated antiviral defence,” said Prof Xia. “In other words, the virus has become stealthy and dangerous to humans.”The biologist examined all 1,252\u0026nbspgenomes from the same coronavirus family as Sars-CoV-2 on the open-source database GenBank.Can you catch coronavirus from your pet?They found that only genomes from canine coronaviruses, which\u0026nbspcaused a highly contagious intestinal disease\u0026nbspin dogs worldwide, had CpG values similar to those observed in SARS-CoV-2 and its most closely related known relative in bats.Prof Xia said this was consistent\u0026nbspwith the interpretation that the low CpG in Sars-CoV-2 was acquired by the ancestor of Sars-CoV-2 evolving in mammalian digestive systems.”He added this conclusion was “further corroborated by a recent report that a high proportion of Covid-19 patients also suffer from digestive discomfort”.Chinese research published last month found 48.5 per cent of 204 coronavirus admitted to three hospitals in Hubei described experienced symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain.In another study which examined the first 12 patients diagnosed with Covid-19 in the US, one patient reported diarrhoea as their initial symptom before a fever and cough, and stool samples from seven out of 10 patients tested positive for Sars-Cov-2.There have been reports of health officials in China and Russia culling stray and pet dogs and cats in an attempt to contain the coronavirus, a strategy condemned as “unscientific and simply cruel”.But a Chinese study published in the journal\u0026nbspScience\u0026nbsplast week found the virus which causes\u0026nbspCovid-19\u0026nbsp“replicates poorly” in dogs, although ferrets and cats are susceptible to infection.The World Health Organisation said last month “there is no evidence that companion animalspets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When that ice age ended, sea levels rose and oxygen levels plummeted, resulting in a deficiency of oxygen, or anoxia.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn a new study, researchers at Stanford University found evidence that these anoxic conditions lasted for more than three million years – significantly longer than similar extinction events.“For most ocean life, it\u0026nbspwas indeed a really bad time to be alive,” said co-author Erik Sperling, an assistant professor of geological sciences at Stanford University.Created with Sketch.On the brink of extinction \u0026ampndash 25 of our closest relatives Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The study, published in Nature Communications, examined the geological record on the boundary between the Hirnantian and Rhuddanian ages in an attempt to bolster the theory.A new model was created by Richard George Stockey, a graduate student at Stanford Earth, to incorporate previously published metal isotope data as well as new data from samples of black shale\u0026nbspfrom the\u0026nbspMurzuq\u0026nbspBasin in Libya.Taking into account 31 different variables, including the amounts of uranium and molybdenum that settle on the sea floor, it concluded that severe and prolonged ocean anoxia must have occurred across large volumes of Earth’s oceans.“We can confidently say a long and profound global anoxic event is linked to the second pulse of mass extinction in the Late Ordovician,” said Mr Sperling.The researchers said the findings have relevance for today given that global climate change is contributing to declining oxygen levels in the open ocean and coastal waters.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Data published by the DWP last year showed that £1 of every £10 in universal credit payments was deducted from claimants in order to pay off advances.\u0026nbspThe DWP has so far\u0026nbspmade 365,000 advance payments to new claimants during the pandemic.The DWP said it had redeployed 10,000 staff from other parts of government and was\u0026nbsprecruiting extra workers to help process the new\u0026nbspclaims, but critics fear drafting in new staff – many of whom may not have adequate training – will\u0026nbspnot be enough to avoid delays and mistakes.How to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?The veteran Labour MP said the “extraordinary” five-week wait claimants faced before receiving their first payment, and the further delays he anticipated, would likely\u0026nbspdraw a “wave of criticism” from new applicants who may also be more\u0026nbsppolitically active than those claiming benefits before the pandemic.“Some of them are active in Tory associations, so I think there’s going to be a huge education of the Tory Party about what universal credit is like and whether it is fit for purpose when you’re on your uppers and you’ve got to wait five weeks,” said Mr Field.“Many of these people will be very politically active at letting their MPs know. Their question will be how can we – and let alone the poor – wait? We need money now. We’re in a new politics as far as universal credit goes.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA source working in the DWP told The Independent that due to the sudden surge in cases and the lack of training for civil servants erted from other parts of government to processing universal credit claims, the level\u0026nbspof error\u0026nbspwould be “phenomenal”.“There have been complaints that they’re given bite-size training. People aren’t learning all the rules about universal credit, it’s more of an overview. There are people working on claims who are not sure what they’re doing. And that’s no fault of people doing the job, it’s just trying to manage an impossible situation,” said the source.“There is going to be a big problem at a later date. There’s going to be a massive exercise cleaning up all the errors that have gone in, which is going to be one hell of a task. If these levels continue in the long-term, I don’t think the system can cope with it.”A charity has also\u0026nbspraised concerns that, even without the anticipated errors and delays, claimants will struggle to manage financially while they wait for\u0026nbsptheir first payment – and would face falling into debt\u0026nbspif they successfully applied\u0026nbspfor an advance loan.Liam Evans, campaigns officer at Turn2us, which helps people in financial hardship to access charitable grants and support services,\u0026nbspcalled on the government to remove the five-week wait\u0026nbspby making the advance payment a non-repayable grant\u0026nbspimmediately.He said the charity had\u0026nbspseen 1 million people\u0026nbspapproach it for financial support in the last three weeks, and estimated that\u0026nbsp3.5\u0026nbspmillion would eventually need to claim universal credit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.“Five weeks is simply far too long to wait for universal credit, and asking claimants to get into debt by taking out an advance is not a practical solution, added Mr Evans.“We also know the DWP is under immense pressure during the coronavirus pandemic, so it is highly likely many claimants will have to wait more than five weeks for their first payment.Created with Sketch.Words at the window: Social isolation and the Coronavirus Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Agnetha Septimus, Matthew Septimus, and children Ezra and NoraHusband and wife filmmakers, Claire Ince and Ancil McKain pose for a portrait for the series by Shutterstock Staff Photographer, Stephen Lovekin, shot around the Ditmas Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New YorkKhadijah Silver and son EliotAnna Beth Rousakis and daughter Mary RousakisMike Pergola and Denise Pergola with children Henry, Jack, and WillJean Davis and Danny Rosenthal, with children Simone, Naomi, and LeahLisa Draho and Josh Zuckerman, with children Ruby and AvaProfessor and activist Dr Kristin LawlerTom Smith and Laura Ross, with daughters Caroline, Elizabeth, and AbigailCallie Lovekin and Lucas LovekinAgnetha Septimus, Matthew Septimus, and children Ezra and NoraHusband and wife filmmakers, Claire Ince and Ancil McKain pose for a portrait for the series by Shutterstock Staff Photographer, Stephen Lovekin, shot around the Ditmas Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New YorkKhadijah Silver and son EliotAnna Beth Rousakis and daughter Mary RousakisMike Pergola and Denise Pergola with children Henry, Jack, and WillJean Davis and Danny Rosenthal, with children Simone, Naomi, and LeahLisa Draho and Josh Zuckerman, with children Ruby and AvaProfessor and activist Dr Kristin LawlerTom Smith and Laura Ross, with daughters Caroline, Elizabeth, and AbigailCallie Lovekin and Lucas LovekinA DWP spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“Universal credit is delivering in these unprecedented times and more than 1.4 million people have successfully made a claim.\u0026nbspWith such a huge increase in claims there are pressures on our services, but the system is holding up well and our dedicated staff are working flat out to get people the support they need.“We’re taking urgent action to boost capacity – we’ve moved 10,000 existing staff to the help on the front line and we’re recruiting more.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

Some 1.5 million people reported not eating for a whole day during the first three weeks of\u0026nbsplockdown, according to a\u0026nbspYouGov\u0026nbsppoll for The Food Foundation.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been supporting\u0026nbspwork going on across the country to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak and is backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile several food banks have told us they have been forced to close their doors, many of them are attempting to switch gears and move into the home delivery of emergency food packages.Bassetlaw Food Bank in Nottinghamshire was forced to “temporarily suspend” normal\u0026nbspoperations at the beginning of April, after it lost more than two-thirds of its mainly older volunteers who are having to self-isolate or follow NHS shielding guidance.How to support our campaignAdministrator Mark\u0026nbspBagguley\u0026nbspis part of a skeleton team now working with\u0026nbspBassetlaw\u0026nbspCouncil Voluntary Service (BCVS) to make sure the most vulnerable people in the area get food parcels dropped at their door.“You just have to find a different way of doing things,” he said. “We’re trying to work others as best we can. It’s very difficult to say whether the local need is being met, now that everything has been thrown on its head. You just have to help as many people as you can.”Despite food donations left in supermarket collection points “dwindling significantly”, Mr Bagguley is making sure the produce gets taken to the BCVS’s central hub, where drivers deliver to people struggling with job losses, cuts in income or difficultly getting outside for health reasons.The Welcome Centre, an independent food bank in Huddersfield, has lost 50 per cent of its volunteers since the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspbegan. Yet demand for help has roughly doubled in the past few weeks.\u0026nbspKirklees\u0026nbspCouncil has sent two members of full-time staff to help the charity carry on by making home deliveries across the West Yorkshire town.“We normally help about 300 people in a month,” said Emma Greenough, one of The Welcome Centre’s managers. “It’s likely we’re helping around 600 people at the moment – although it’s guesswork at the moment because things are changing so fast.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the government could suspend the five-week wait for universal credit, it would be a big help to people.”Both the Trussell Trust, Britain’s largest network of food banks, and the Independent Food Aid\u0026nbspNetwork (IFAN) are calling on the Department for Work and Pension to end the five week-wait on new claimants receiving their first universal credit payment.Ms\u0026nbspGoodwin said some of the independent food banks that closed a few weeks ago have already been able to re-emerge in a different form. “At the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak at least 12 of our member organisations closed. Since then, three of them have reopened because they have been able to adapt and put new processes in place.”The DENS Food Bank in Hemel Hempstead, part of the Trussell Trust network, is relying on extra help so it can continue to operate. Demand for food parcels has gone up 75 per cent in the past few weeks, at a time the food bank is struggling with a drop in volunteers. It has forged an alliance\u0026nbspwith another local charity called the South Hill Centre, allowing volunteer drivers to make home deliveries to people asking for help.“A lot of people have seen their income drop and they don’t have savings to cover them,” said Wendy Lewington, DENS Food Bank’s CEO. “For the self-employed, the government help that might be there in a couple of months isn’t there immediately so they’re struggling to afford the basics.”Both the Welcome Centre and DENS Decorum Food Bank are looking for financial donations and non-perishable items such as UHT milk, soups, tinned meat and fish – proving harder for many food banks to buy in bulk at the supermarkets.Despite the difficulties faced by small, local food banks, some of the larger food surplus charities – rescuing\u0026nbspunwanted or short-dated stock from restaurants, retailers and\u0026nbspmanufacturers\u0026nbsp– are stepping up to fill\u0026nbspsome of the gaps.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is supporting the work of our key partner The Felix Project – which has teamed with two other large organisations\u0026nbspin London to forge the London Food Alliance.The London Food Alliance is now coordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies, and also providing meals for\u0026nbspNHS staff.The Independent\u0026nbspis also encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And there are those who choose to continue to attack us without presenting any evidence.Hostility with China is not going to help solve the coronavirus crisisTory rebels are right – Huawei is a threat to our national securityJohnson suffers revolt in Tory vote to end Huawei 5G involvement“Disrupting our involvement in the 5G rollout would do Britain a disservice.”Last month, the government hinted at future concessions to opponents of Huawei’s involvement in rolling out the ultrafast wireless technology when a minister said 36 Tory MPs who refused to vote in line with the leadership had been heard “loud and clear”.The rebels fear Huawei is effectively a front for the Chinese state – putting the UK’s security at risk – and want it ripped out of the 5G network by the end of 2022.But in his letter, Mr Zhang highlighted Huawei’s already extensive role in Britain’s data network, and said the firm was “focused on keeping Britain connected” during the “unprecedented” coronavirus pandemic.Created with Sketch.Inside Huawei\u0027s new campus for workers in China Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanAn employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanHe said data usage had increased by at least 50 per cent since Covid-19 first reached the UK, placing “significant pressure” on telecoms systems.“That’s why reliable mobile and broadband networks are crucial.

I’m usually a very calm person, but this has pretty much broken me.“I’m being told to take myself\u0026nbspthrough an airport and get on a plane during this pandemic,\u0026nbspand go somewhere in the States. Where do I stay? There are people still homeless on the streets who can’t find somewhere to go. Who’s going to rent at this time? Am I supposed to live at the garage at my sister’s house? It’s mind-boggling.”How to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?The UK government’s guidance currently advises against all but essential travel to the US, and states that those who are able to enter the country from the UK by air would be asked to self-isolate for 14 days.Hours after The Independent contacted the Home Office on Monday, a\u0026nbspBorder Force\u0026nbspagent called Ms Collins to tell her the date by which she must leave the UK had been pushed back to mid-May. However, she remains fearful of being forcibly separated from her Scottish partner Alan Gibb.The 60-year-old moved to the UK to live in Aberdeen with Mr Gibb\u0026nbspin 2013 after the pair met the previous year while he was working at the same venue as her in Houston. She applied for, and was granted, leave to remain in the UK on a partner visa for a five-year period in January 2016, after paying more than £1,700 for the application.A problem emerged when Ms Collins visited the US for 11 weeks in 2018 to care for her younger sister, who had been diagnosed with blood cancer, during which she inadvertently missed the renewal date for her\u0026nbspvisa.She said she had been told she could still renew it on her return to the UK, but on arriving at Heathrow Airport she was detained for five hours and had a visit visa stamped in her passport, which in effect cancelled her previous partner visa.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe Home Office\u0026nbspsubsequently refused her application\u0026nbspto renew the visa in January 2019, stating that she was not eligible to do so as a visitor. Ms Collins and Mr Gibb have since been fighting to appeal the decision.Mr Gibb, who is now retired but formally worked in the oil and gas industry, said: “I’m gobsmacked. It’s incredulous, the whole thing. It’s a\u0026nbspcompletely nonsensical situation\u0026nbspfrom start to finish.\u0026nbspI cannot comprehend it, especially under the current circumstances.Katie has nowhere to go. It’s bad enough deporting anyone any time –\u0026nbspunless they’ve committed a heinous crime of course –\u0026nbspbut under the current circumstances it beggars belief. It shows how much is wrong with this system. We’re dumbfounded.”Stephen Flynn, the couple\u0027s local MP, said:\u0026nbsp“You have to seriously question the motivation behind this UK government when it appears willing to deport iniduals during the middle of a global pandemic.“I’ve been in direct contact with Katie and the Home Office and will continue to try and press for this deportation threat to be dropped and for a full review of her case to be undertaken –\u0026nbspit’s only fair that this happens.”Caroline Coombs, co-founder of Reunite Families UK, a charity which has been supporting Ms Collins, said: “Serving a deportation order on Easter Monday is quite frankly unbelievable. We know officials are working every hour God sends at this time, but ministers will surely want their officials to look again at this case.“Deporting an innocent 60-year-old woman who has a family in the UK\u0026nbspduring a global pandemic makes no sense. \u0026nbspEspecially when the last immigration minister admitted the department had made mistakes. Everybody’s time would be better spent if the home office halted this action and not break Kate and Alan’s hearts over a technicality.A Home Office spokesperson said they did not routinely comment on inidual cases, adding:\u0026nbsp“We have been clear that iniduals lawfully in the UK will not be penalised for circumstances beyond their control, which is why we are extending their leave until 31 May 2020.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

No of course not.”But he added: “While the economic impacts are significant, the OBR also expect them to be temporary, with a bounce back in growth.“The OBR today have been clear that if we had not taken the actions we have, the situation would be much worse. In other words, our plan is the right plan.”The chancellor played down suggestions of a growing rift in the cabinet between ministers who want to extend tight social distancing guidelines and others who want them lifted to revive the economy.“Right now, the single most important thing we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people,” he said.“It is not a case of choosing between the economy and public health.“Common sense tells us that doing so would be self-defeating.“At a time when we are seeing hundreds of people dying every day from this terrible disease, the absolute priority must be to focus all of our resources – not just of the state but of businesses and all of you at home as well – in a collective national effort to beat this virus.”Mr Sunak rejected suggestions that the UK would be feeling the financial cost of coronavirus for a generation to come, insisting that measures such as the government’s “furlough” scheme would allow the UK to “bounce back as quickly as possible”.“This is going to be hard, our economy is going to take a significant hit and people are going to feel that in their jobs and in their household incomes,” he said.But he added: “What I would say and what the OBR report confirms is that the measures we’ve put in place can significantly mitigate that impact.”Liberal Democrat acting leader Ed Davey said too many people had been “left out” of Mr Sunak’s plans, including those who changed jobs in the weeks before the lockdown, many self-employed people and businesses which had found themselves unable to secure the loans he has announced.“Our economy is falling off a cliff, but it seems the chancellor has no more help to offer,” said Davey.“Facing the possibility of an economic downturn of historic proportions, the chancellor needed to be absolutely clear about planning for additional interventions to protect jobs and livelihoods as the crisis evolves. Instead the chancellor fell back on rhetoric about having the ‘right’ plan.”Office for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The sign that adorned the entrance of the market, a landmark of Wuhan city, has also been removed.As residents prepare for a return to work this week, business owners at the market will have nowhere to go. “Since all businesses need to apply for permission from the government before they restart operation, it will be impossible for these businesses to gain the government’s approval,” said Michael, who used to own a fruit stand a few blocks away from the Huanan Seafood Market and refused to give his real name.Wildlife trade was once a lucrative and thriving industry in China, but the suspicion that the current coronavirus pandemic started in\u0026nbspexotic animals smuggled into the country has forced the government to crack down on the decades-old trade.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast month, Beijing rolled out a strict ban on the breeding and consumption of wild animals, as it tried to prevent another outbreak from happening. This was a general guidance issued from the central government, with the power to enforce the law ultimately lying with provincial or municipal officials.Several other provinces have followed suit, and the southern industrial hub Shenzhen announced a ban on the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat on Thursday, becoming the first Chinese city to do so.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIn Wuhan, local officials have been increasingly strict in their crackdown on businesses engaged in wildlife trade or breeding. On 3 March, local authorities in Wuhan carried out a comprehensive disinfection campaign across the entire Huanan Seafood Market.However, recent reports suggest that despite the regional governments\u0027\u0026nbspefforts to put an end to wildlife trade, illicit commercial activities are still happening at public markets in certain parts of China. Earlier this week, the Mail on Sunday reported that thousands of customers flooded an indoor market in the southwestern city of Guilin in China, as living dogs and cats were crammed into cages while dead bats and scorpions were on display.Andrew Huang, a Chinese culinary expert, says one of the reasons why it’s hard for the Chinese government to completely end the consumption and trading of wildlife in China is because such behaviours have become part of decades-olds tradition in the country.“Different parts of China have their specific traditions of consuming wildlife for different purposes,” Mr Huang explains. “In the northeastern part of China, bears and deers are a big part of the local delicacies while in southwestern China, bats and pangolins are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The steady demand for such wildlife has nurtured a lucrative supply chain, including some businesses that focus on breeding specific types of wild animals.”Mr Huang thinks that the current crackdown on wildlife trade and consumption might temporarily prevent relevant practices from happening in public markets, but it will be hard to completely eliminate it from the Chinese culture.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“In the short term, even if wildlife sellers can’t keep selling these animals in public, they will try to find other ways to keep the businesses alive,” Mr Huang tells The Independent. “As the old saying goes, life will always find a way. Even if the government has banned wildlife trade and consumption, the tradition won’t be so easily wiped out.”‘No need to close the entire market’In Wuhan, while the plan to shut down the Huanan Seafood Market is underway, local residents have different opinions about how to handle the market where the coronavirus pandemic began.“Honestly, wildlife trade isn’t the main commercial activity at the Hunan Seafood Market, as most of the sellers still focus on selling different kinds of seafood,” says Ms Xu, who was a frequent shopper at the market until it was shut down.Since the market is right next to one of the major train stations in the city, she says, it has become the regional hub for selling fruits and seafood, as well as wildlife. Due to the large number of visitors coming from different parts of Hubei province, it also became the ideal breeding ground for the coronavirus.“I think even if the government wants to ban wildlife trade, they don’t have to shut down the entire seafood market,” Ms Xu says. “This will have a huge impact on local restaurants and businesses that have long relied on the market for their seafood supplies.”Ms Xu says that instead of forcing dozens of business owners to lose their livelihoods, the Chinese government should focus more on tackling the ongoing pandemic itself. “I wish the government could conduct more coronavirus tests on citizens, because I suspect many of them could still be asymptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Universities, churches, cinemas and shopping malls will remain closed until at least 10 May, and a ban on congregations of more than 100 people will remain in place until August.But Judit, whose young daughter has type-1 diabetes, tells\u0026nbspThe Independent that she is afraid of sending her child back to school.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I’m worried that children are being used as an experiment and, if I’m honest, I am not convinced by the letter we received from the school listing the additional safety measures they’re implementing.”Her daughter has, however, been desperate to go back to class.“Her hospital advised us that it was safe, so we’ve agreed to let her go back this week. But my concern is still there – we need to be extremely careful.”What the UK can learn from South Korea’s success with coronavirusHow Greece managed to flatten the curveHow Germany became Europe’s first country to flatten the curveIs Sweden having second thoughts on lockdown?A number of Facebook groups have\u0026nbspbeen set up by worried parents, including one under the name “my child will not be a Guinea pig for Covid-19”, which already has over 39,000 members.For\u0026nbspJude, her nine-year-old’s lessons will be held outside, which has reassured her. Children have been asked to wear suitable clothing\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspat another\u0026nbspschool in Fyn, the head teacher put a call out for donations of large camping tents.“I am very happy to send her. There are of course risks, and I realise we are the test case,” she says.Denmark, Europe’s second country to impose a lockdown, has not seen the same levels of coronavirus fatalities as has rocked the west of the continent. Measures were put in place by the government on 11 March\u0026nbsp– before it had even reported its first death.More than 6,500 people have been infected in the country, and 299 have died.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFor Judit, concerns still remain on what would happen if her husband gets sick.“We moved to Denmark recently and, as his business is new here, we aren’t eligible for financial support from the government, so he still needs to go to work.”Trade unions are a key political stakeholder in Denmark, with 70 per cent of the working population holding trade union membership. The measures introduced by the government throughout the pandemic have been developed in negotiation with trade unions, as well as industry bodies – a decision-making structure that has precedence in the country’s tripartite wage bargaining agreements.Elisa Rimpler from the Danish Union of Early Childhood and Youth Educators (BUPL) says they are following all of the government guidelines, but conceded the task at hand was “extremely difficult”.“That being said, the early childhood education and youth workers are not simply passive actors in this situation. BUPL helps the authorities make qualified decisions and find solutions to many complex issues. The Danish Model has proved to be strong in situations of crisis like this.”Like many countries, Denmark’s response to the coronavirus has been driven by the ambition to “flatten the curve” of cases and limit acute pressure on health care services. But the early measures were also intended to buffer the economic impacts of coronavirus.During a press conference last week, prime minister Mette Frederiksen said the country\u0026nbspwas “going the right way” in tackling the pandemic.“We are now on the second\u0026nbspflattened curve in the graph, meaning there is a hospital bed and respirator for those who need it.”In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Denmark’s unemployment figures soared, as struggling companies laid off employees at an unprecedented rate. Though costly, the government hopes the 2.6bn Danish kroner support package for businesses and employees will not only support iniduals to remain at\u0026nbsphome, but will facilitate recovery from the anticipated pandemic-induced financial crisis.Danes have overall been supportive of the government’s decisions in response to coronavirus. A poll conducted at the beginning of April found that Frederiksen’s approval rating had doubled in the month since the outbreak reached Europe. But this doesn’t mean iniduals – particularly parents and those who continue to work – are fearless either.Klaus Hoeyer, a professor at the University of Copenhagen’s department of public health, is now leading a\u0026nbspnew research project exploring how Danes are coping with the coronavirus pandemic. He says “From a public health perspective, it makes sense opening up the nurseries and schools first because of a low risk at the population level, but for the inidual family it might speak to their worst fears about coronavirus – it does not matter if few are likely to be hit hard, if they fear being one of them.“And families differ. They might not fear for the child, but for a family member from a high-risk group. It’s important that we remain sensitive to that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Using a technique known as credential stuffing, hackers are able to link login details that are used for more than one online account in order to compromise another.​Cyber security experts responded to the dark web listings by reiterating the common-sense security practice of not using the same password across multiple websites and apps.“Hackers use very simple tools to re-use passwords that are stolen in separate data breaches – an attack known as ‘password stuffing’. They are then able to quickly attempt to access all accounts with the same email address as the user name,”\u0026nbspsaid Jake Moore, a security specialist at antivirus firm ESET.“Zoom users must never use the same password anywhere else, but it is especially crucial that the same password is not used for their email account too, or the attacker would be able to send invites from the victim, making the attack even more dangerous.”Despite Zoom not being directly implicated, the discovery once again raises security concerns about the video chat app, which has seen a huge surge in popularity in recent weeks as a result of coronavirus containment measures forcing people to work from home.The company has been criticised for the way it handles users’ personal information, as well as a phenomenon known as “Zoombombing”, whereby strangers join meetings and disrupt conversations with offensive language and behaviour.It has prompted some organisations and businesses to ban its use and prompted the FBI to issue a warning last month\u0026nbspabout making Zoom meetings public.Zoom recently hired a former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos as an adviser\u0026nbspand released new updates in an effort to address these issues.“It is common for web services that serve consumers to be targeted by this type os activity, which typically involves bad actors testing large numbers of already compromised credentials from other platforms to see if users have reused them elsewhere,\u0026nbspA Zoom spokesperson told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“We have already hired multiple intelligence firms to find these password dumps and the tools used to create them, as well as a firm that has shut down thousands of websites attempting to trick users into downloading malware or giving up their credentials.“We continue to investigate, are locking accounts we have found to be compromised, asking users to change their passwords to something more secure, and are looking at implementing additional technology solutions to bolster our efforts.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was a magnicent address, from a magnicent woman.Her experience and serenity did more to calm and inspire the nation than anything  I can think of as this crisis has unfolded.Best of all, she reminded us that there will be le beyond this lockdown — that we will meet again.If we just focus on the here and now, we won’t be able to prepare for the future beyond the virus.But it’s also true that none of us can think straight when we are in the eye of the storm.That is where good leadership comes in. It helps us all to hold strong, not to go to pieces and to stick to the guidance given to us.Everyone looks to the leader to make decisions, and it’s the decisions we make that will chart our way out of the crisis.Unfortunately, after the Queen’s address to the nation came the news that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been admitted to hospital intensive care.At that point, anyone who was in any doubt this illness did not discriminate was forced to reconsider.At the time of writing, Boris was back on a regular hospital ward. But his illness has been a reminder that any of us are susceptible to Covid-.Most people are shocked he is in hospital and sympathise with his pregnant girlfriend Carrie Symonds.But of course it has raised the question: Who is really in chargehe is not  Without leadership, we all get distinctly uneasy.We all have leaders in our lives. We are all looking towards them to show us what to do and lead us through it.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealSome companies have stepped up to the plate and are doing good things — reassuring their staff, treating people well and doing their utmost to make sure people will be paid. Some aren’t, of course. But good bosses are taking pay cuts and doing everything they can to keep their businesses alive and look after their staff.At West Ham United we continue to pay all our full and part-time staff  per cent of their wages.My financial director, my manager and I have all taken a  per cent reduction to make sure this happens.It’s when there’s a crisis like this that we see who is made of what.Boris’s temporary stand-in, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, while talking about the PM’s hospital admission, referred to him as his boss, his colleague, but also his friend.Respect and friendship are the key words when it comes to good leadership.A good leader makes the tough decisions because they are right, but they are also governed by ethics. They want to do the right thing, for the right reasons. They are happy to make personal sacrices to ensure the majority are looked after.It is more important now, than ever, to put people before profits.After three weeks of lockdown, with no chance of a let-up, it’s all too easy to fall prey to catastrophic, even apocalyptic thinking.But we have to sht our thought process. We have to accept and understand that, at some point, this WILL be over.When things are calmer and clearer, we can ask what we can do to ensure we are still operating as the world gets back to normal — whatever the new normal is.The experience we are all living through really is like a storm, which continues to rage.There are so many unprecedented aspects to this situation and there is not one person in the world who will come out of it unchanged.So while there are so many challenging and dficult things going on, perhaps this lockdown is a chance for us all to learn more about ourselves.How are you responding  Have you thought about how you can help others  Have you thought about volunteering for the NHS As well as the importance of good leadership, we all have our inidual roles when it comes to showing autonomy and courage about our own decisions.I’m sorry to say, things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.So we all need to take responsibility — or we will never get out of lockdown.ANYONE who saw the social media video of Naomi Watts reaching breaking point after her printer, vacuum cleaner and dishwasher all broke down will surely have smiled in recognition.Naomi, who has been self-isolating in her Los Angeles home for three weeks, shared her very understandable anguish with a slow-motion video of herself screaming with the sound of a lion’s roar played in the background.I think we can all relate to her frustration.My lockdown revelation I am happy to report that I have given up ironing!WHEN it comes to illness, particularly cancer, I’ve long resisted all the talk of going into battle – mainly because of the unhelpful implication of weakness among those who “lose” that fight by dying.I feel the same way about descriptions of people “fighting” coronavirus.Illness is a fact of le. It is not a sign of weakness.The sad and terrible truth is that some people get this virus and others do not.Some have it very badly – a whole lot worse than others.We don’t yet know exactly why. We don’t even knowwe have the virus and may infect people.We don’t knowthere are antibodies that can protect us from getting it again, or how long that will take.We don’t knowthere will be a more deadly mutation of the same virus in the future.There is just too much we don’t know.But there are some practical things we can do.We need to help those who have it now, and the NHS and the Government are doing all they can in this regard.We also need to stop the spread of the virus, through testing. Hopefully that is going to happen soon.Meanwhile, scientists are also working around the clock to create a vaccine.Perhaps, most of all, we need to prepare for the possibility that this could all happen again.We need to learn lessons on food distribution, working from home, adapting our businesses – and having proper personal protection and hospital equipment ready and waiting.AS time ticks on, we are all realising what le is like without the things we used to consider necessities.Like our hairdressers.Claudia Winkleman’s Instagram post showing how unmanageable her fringe has become during lockdown made me laugh in recognition.My hair is grey, long and unkempt.On the one hand, it’s the least of my worries, which is quite liberating.Still, I did manage to get my hands on some hair dye for the roots.Do I care that it’s completely the wrong shade NO. I do not.So please, can we all just agree to turn a blind eye to the way we look when we finally emerge from lockdown HAPPY Easter Sunday, people. How will you be spending yours Personally, I have lost track of what day it is. The past few weeks have been a blur, with every day feeling like a cross between Sunday and Monday.It was my birthday last week and, without loved ones to hug, friends to see, drinks to be had, it was more or less just another day.Equally, this is the first time ever that Easter has felt like just another weekend.But I hope you can find ways to make it special. Just make sure you do so at home.THERE has been talk of schools possibly reopening after the Easter holidays – and who knows whether or not that is true But one thing I do know is that, whenever they do reopen, working parents will not only give the most massive sigh of relief, they will all be thanking their children’s teachers profusely for everything that they do.We will all also be thanking doctors, nurses, all NHS employees, as well as bin men, cleaners, shop assistants and all the other key workers we have under-paid and taken for granted.I really hope that is one thing which changes as a result of this pandemic.These people are the backbone of our country.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One says that restrictions should be lted sooner rather than later to reboot our ecomony, while the other argues that the restrictions are working, so now is not the right time to lt them.When Chancellor Rishi Sunak first announced his bail-out plan last month, it was estimated that ten to  per cent of workers in the ­private sector would need Government support.Now economic forecasters believe it could be a third of the total private sector workforce. That will cost the British taxpayer between £billion and £billion every three months.To date, about a fth of small businesses have been pushed into bankruptcy. If the lockdown continues to July, that figure will rise to a third.The effect of this on the economy will be catastrophic. According to the ­Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Britain’s GDP could contract by  per cent over the next two years. It shrank by six per cent during the global financial crisis of -.The Centre for Economics and Business Researchsays the lockdown is costing £.billion a day.Given we are now  days into the lockdown, this means we are already more than £billlion out of pocket.In short,we don’t ease off on the social distancing measures and re-boot the economy, we’re heading for the biggest economic downturn since the s.Against this, we are told thatwe end the lockdown more people will become infected, demand for critical hospital care will outstrip the NHS’s capacity and we’ll begin to see people dying in even greater numbers.I’m sceptical about that prognosis.It is based on the statistical modelling of Professor Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College, but there is mounting evidence that they under-estimated the percentage of the population already infected with coronavirus and over-estimated how deadly this disease is.According to Prof Ferguson’s model, fewer than five per cent of people have been infected. But according to another model, this one produced by Oxford University, it could be higher than  per cent, which would mean we are on our way to acquiring herd immunity.When Chris Whitty, England’s Chief Medical Officer, was asked at Thursday’s press conference what percentage of the world’s population has been infected, he put the figure at  per cent.If the true figure is between  and  per cent, the NHS can probably copewe ease off on some of the more extreme social distancing measures.Would ending the lockdown be ­gambling with people’s lives  Yes, but so will keeping it in place.Economic downturns cost lives, just as surely as viruses. During the global financial crisis of –, the suicide rate in Europe increased by . per cent. Economic recessions also cause a rise in poverty, domestic ­violence and murder.Philip Thomas, professor of risk ­management at Bristol University, has calculated thatour GDP falls by more than . per cent as a result of the lockdown, more years of le will be lost than saved.Politicians here and where have justied their cautious approach by ­saying they refuse to put a price on human le, as though the trade-off is between the lives of vulnerable people and economic growth.But the real trade-off is between the lives we might losewe end the ­lockdown tomorrow and the lives we know we will losewe keep it in place indefinitely.MPs aren’t being morally ­courageous. Rather, they’re just focusing on the next -hour news cycle, as they always do.What’s needed is a bold political leader who’s willing to risk some short-term pain to re-start the economy, thereby safeguarding all of our futures.I know of just such a person, but unfortunately he’s in hospital recovering from coronavirus.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe UK government’s measures to contain the coronavirus epidemic are just starting to make a ­dference.And with the three-week lockdown under review tomorrow, now is NOT the time to lt them.After a slow and indecisive start, the measures they now have put in place, including recommendations to stay at home, limiting travel, physical ­distancing, banning large gatherings and shutting shops and pubs, are just starting to show signs that they are slowing the spread of the virus.This means that there are fewer new cases, with fewer people becoming seriously sick and less demand on hospital beds, intensive care and articial ventilation.This means that the pressure on health services is reduced, which, in turn, will lead to fewer deaths from Covid- and other causes.Without the actions that have been taken and just letting the epidemic run its course, we would be likely to see more than half the population infected, and an overwhelmed health system with maybe five million hospital admissions and at least , deaths.The measures that have been taken in the UK have been of moderate strength compared to other countries.In France and Spain, the lockdown has been more severe, while in Sweden it has been less strict.The coronavirus epidemic can be thought of like a fire.If we starve a fire of oxygen, then the flames will stop and it will die down.So it is with the epidemic — reduce transmission from person to person and the number of cases will go down.Butyou let the oxygen come back too early, any embers in the fire will light up again and it will restart.So,we relax the lockdown too early, while there is still transmission of the virus going on, then the epidemic will restart.And that means that we would have wasted the efforts we have made so far.When transmission has stopped, or is at low enough levels that it can be monitored and each case and their contacts identied, isolated and treated, then the lockdown can be relaxed.We have not yet reached the peak of the epidemic, and we do not yet have the infrastructure in place for the systematic testing that will be needed to identy new cases, so now is not the time to relax the lockdown measures.Some people have talked about the serious damage done to the economy by measures the Government has put in place and the social disruption these have caused, in order to protect the public health of the nation.They have argued the lockdown will cause more harm than good in the long term. This is a  dilemma.Every le matters. Each person lost is a family member, a friend, a neighbour, a human being.They are not a number on a spreadsheet.This lockdown is the only way for us to get back on our feet.If left uncontrolled, the coronavirus by itself will cause social and economic disruption as well as damaging public health.It doesn’t need any help from politicians.It is up to us all, for the sake of ourselves, our families and our loved ones, to follow the rules, and our solidarity will allow the country totowards normal as soon as possible.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve never been so pleased to see my copy spiked.We now know from the PM himself just how close he came to death. But had things turned out dferently, my first sentence would still ring true.Boris would have paid the ultimate price for Covid-.The killer virus was spawned in China’s primitive “wet markets” and concealed by the country’s secretive communist regime and blamed by China on America and the West.Beijing’s claim of only , dead is a sick joke. The true figure could be ten times as high — or more.This, remember, is the regime that still lies about the thousands slaughtered in the  Tiananmen Square massacre.Yet China, having destroyed lives and livelihoods around the globe, is emerging as the big winner from its own pandemic.Like vultures hovering over roadkill, leaders of the world’s second-biggest economy are eyeing up the casualties of this made in-China calamity.Covid- risks opening the door to Beijing’s dominance over world trade and commerce, at unimaginable cost to our freedoms and democracy.Rattled world leaders, from Australia to Germany, are drafting emergency laws to prevent China mopping up crown jewels in pharmaceuticals, minerals, articial intelligence and robot technology.But it is probably too late. The West has turned a blind eye to China’s decades of industrial espionage and its cut-price grab for market share.Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is utterly dependent on cheap, heavily subsidised Chinese components and the VW and Mercedes car sales that account for a third of their profits.Suicidally, it will see Chinese cash as a passport out of the crisis.“We have grown too idle and too comfortable to want to do the things the Chinese do for us,” says a Cabinet insider.The world stood silent as China’s Belt And Road programme gobbled up key ports and industries, rare earth minerals and rich farmland across Africa and the Third World.Beijing is now rubbing its hands at the prospect of fresh bargains.Household-name firms here and in Europe are struggling to survive the lockdown. Some will never reopen their doors.The best might end up in Beijing at fire-sale prices.China has already seized a big stake in the UK with its richly subsidised £billion contract for the Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset.Telecoms giant Huawei has its sticky fingers all over our sensitive G superhighway — a decision which must now surely be reversed.The image of communist China as a civilised equal partner is a dangerous fantasy.“China is not and never will be our friend,” a senior minister warns. “But it is the only one with ready cash and all our markets have collapsed because of something China started.“Our economy is being shattered and it is their fault. The idea of selling them some of our best companies is horrying.”China’s own economy has been hammered too. But it remains a ruthless totalitarian state which brooks no opposition.The brutal incarceration of a million Uighur Muslims in “re-education” camps is a blot on the civilised world. So is the trade in human organs from executed prisoners.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealWho will stop China becoming the world’s dominant power It will be hard for our liberal elite to swallow, but the only answer is Donald Trump.The American President has already cracked down on China’s trade and currency cheating. Democrat rival Joe Biden — backed by peace-at-any-price Barack Obama — would kowtow to Beijing.At this pivotal moment in world history, it is reassuring to know President Trump has a high regard for our Prime Minister.Once Boris is back on his feet and coronavirus begins to fade, he must join forces with the world’s greatest superpower and address the smiling menace of Chinese President Xi Jinping.As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.Boris was hardest hit, followed by chief of staff Dominic Cummings, who is only now ing to work after a fortnight in bed.A dozen others, including Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and No Press chief Lee Cain, went down like skittles.So who was the super-spreader The finger of suspicion is pointed at health supremo Matt Hancock, first in and energetically first out of self- isolation. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the moment before that.And probably every spare moment since he was obliged to leave the Sandy Lane Hotel, Barbados, to go through the motions at this old ITV circus, for the th time of asking.Britain’s Got Talent, which began with Ant and Dec sentimentally evoking all the things they love about this great country of ours.The White Clfs of Dover, Blackpool Tower, Edinburgh Castle, Russian sausage dog dancers, a Belgian contortionist, from Got Talent Espana, who scuttled across the stage in the spider position. That sort of quintessentially British thing.There was also, you probably sensed, a collective feeling Britain’s Got Talent didn’t just have a responsibility to lt the nation’s collective mood, over the following  minutes, but a moral duty.An unfair burden to put on any show and a forlorn hope, I thought, given the production has, for many years, involved nothing more inspirational than mixing and matching acts from the worldwide “Talent” franchise with the sort of homegrown sob stories which, however worthy and sincere, can feel a bit beside-the-point compared to the nightmare that’s just engulfed the world.And so it mostly proved on Saturday’s episode.Opinions here will dfer, I realise. In the latter category, though, we had a choir and foster care dancer Yakub, who won me over instantly with his modesty and tact as he announced: “My dream is to dance on . . . I’ve forgotten what I was going to say.” In the former, there was the Belgian contortionist, Papi Flex, an Indian dance troupe and Russia’s Diana Vedyashinka, who has spent the past  years teaching five dachshunds to stand hind-legged on a podium.An admission that made me feel slightly better about spending a similar amount of time watching EastEnders, but not much.There were also, of course, acts that fitted neither category, like James Piper, who’s “a personal trainer by day, magician by night”, meaning he can probably make haemorrhoids appear from nowhere.There was only one person, though, who genuinely lted the gloom.That was the brilliant comedian Steve Royle, from Phoenix Nights and Car Share, whose riotous act, pretending to shove ping-pong balls up his fundament, was funny enough even without the earnest health and safety caption from ITV: “Do not try this at home.” For five glorious minutes I forgot lockdown and began wondering about Steve’s next routine. Then I had to check myself.Because that is the sad and unavoidable issue with these BGT auditions. Unless they’ve got about  weeks of material, coronavirus means it’s a series currently going nowhere.Attempt to press ITV on this matter and all it can tell you is: “We are working with our production colleagues to see how we can make the BGT live shows work in an ever-changing situation.”Mind you, attempt to read Simon Cowell’s mind at the moment and I’m sure you’ll get a far more succinct response.“A jetski.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which month of the year was named after the Roman emperor Augustus Hardball, Ore Oduba: “Which animal has large breeds called Clydesdale and Shire ”Ben Shephard: “On a computer keyboard the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”And Ben Shephard: “Gerald Ford served as US President in which decade of the th century ”A BALLSY move, I thought, for ITV to screen a drama comedy about Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’s coughing cheats during the coronavirus outbreak.The dark irony is, though, it was the only show this past week that was good enough to make me forget the ongoing medical crisis for its duration.The second assumption was that Quiz would stand or fall on Michael Sheen’s impression of Tarrant.It doesn’t. And that’s probably just as well, as it’s a slightly hit-and-miss turn. One moment he’s Tarrant, the next he’s Tommy Cooper, but he always looks more like Les Dennis.Luckily for Quiz, however, it barely matters because James Graham’s script sings and Matthew Macfadyen delivers a performance that’s worthy of award nominations playing the thick-as-a-brick Major Charles Ingram. There are issues as well, obviously.Mark Bonnar’s accent sinks somewhere between Stranraer and Larne as Celador boss Paul Smith and there’s an air of ITV self congratulation in the opening hour about Millionaire’s ratings.A dangerous game to play when you’ve now got Secrets Of The Driving Test filling the show’s slot.All is forgiven and forgotten with tonight’s brilliant second instalmentthough, which concentrates on the coughing episode itself and the fallout, as ITV execs try to work out who they should call at Scotland Yard.“It’s the Celebrity Crime Squad.”“Really  It sounds like a s**t detective show.”“It sounds like something we’d make.”Quite.Manny Monthe: “- is a dangerous scoreline because the next goal wins.”Ian Wright: “Pep Guardiola came in and literally cut Joe Hart’s legs off.”Gary Lineker: “Rafa’s comeback in the Champions League final was his finest moment in the Premier League.”IN the continued absence of live sport, the contest of the week was The Great Celebrity Bake Off, on Channel , where two veteran camera-chasers battled it out for screen time and the winner’s apron.A Holly Willoughby on This Morning B Princess Fiona in Shrek The Musical ITV’s hugely entertaining drama Quiz.

It’s no wonder so many bosses and workers are confused – lawyers are too!Without statutes in place and with regulations changing, it can be hard to provide a definitive answer. The Government has announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which means thatyou both agree, your employer can put you on temporary leave .This applies when they are unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of Covid-. If you are furloughed, you will be paid  per cent of your wages by the Government, up to a monthly cap of £,.It sounds straightforward, but your own unique circumstances can make things tricky.  I have been inundated with questions from people who have been furloughed, had their salary cut or lost their jobs.Here, I have provided my answers to some of your most common queries.Q I STARTED a new job shortly before the lock-down. My new company has advised me it cannot pay me the  per cent government pay because I didn’t start before February . What can I do A Annoyingly for you, your new company is almost certainly right. Unless you were on the payroll by February  they are not legally bound to extend the furlough scheme to you. There are talks about this being changed and lots of pressure on the Government because there are a lot of people in your position. In the meantime, you are entitled to Universal Credit — apply now.Q I WAS late getting to work at a food processing plant due to a change in bus timetables caused by the lockdown. My boss said this was a disciplinary offence and fired me. Is this legal A This is probably not legal. If you have been employed for two years or more this counts as unfair dismissal. If you took your employer to an employment tribunal you would have a good chance of winning.  If you haven’t been employed there for  months you would still be entitled to pay for your notice period.  It is possible you could bring a claim for breach of contract as your employer has almost certainly failed to uphold their own disciplinary procedures. You may also be entitled to a claim for discrimination.  Write to this firm making it clear the country is watching their behaviour — as am I.Q I AM on furlough but my employer is holding back a week’s wages I earned before I was furloughed, saying I will get them when my employment starts again. Can he do this  A Your employer cannot do this, unless it was agreed in a contract. You were promised this money and it has absolutely nothing to do with you being furloughed. I have had a number of messages about this unlawful practice and I understand employers are trying to protect cashflow. Butyou were promised this money your firm is not entitled to withhold it.  It may be that, like many others, you will have to work with your employerthey need that money to stay afloat and protect your job, but make sure they put in writing that the money will be forthcoming in due course. Waiting a while for the money may be better than your company going bust.Q AM I entitled to get another job – say, in a supermarket – while I am on furlough from my employer A I have been inundated with people asking this, but the law is not clear. My view is that unless the contract you have with your current employer specically states you cannot take another job , there is no reason why you cannot during this time. There is nothing as it stands in legislation that prevents you from doing this. The government regulationsare not clear and need clarication.  Importantly, disclosure to your current employer is critical. Do not accept another job without giving clear written notice to your current employer that you are taking up other employment while furloughed.Q MY employer wants me to accept a ten per cent pay cut. I checked my contract and I don’t believe they have the power to do this. Do I have a way of resisting this A Your employer cannot unilaterally decide to cut your wages. You have signed a contract and they have promised to pay you. But these are unprecedented times and there is legal provision which may, in certain circumstances, allow employers to sack you and then,necessary, re-employ you on a reduced salary. Multiple employers have asked staff to take a reduction in order for them to survive. The critical thing is thatyou accept such an offer it must have an end date, in writing. You can’t be forced to accept a contract change, including a salary cut. But be warned thatyou do not, your employer can put you on furlough, which will only cover  per cent of your salary.Q I RESIGNED from my job but my new one has fallen through due to the virus. Where can I get help  A I am afraid you will have to claim Universal Credit. It may be worth writing to your old employer to seethere is work still availble, but your legal remedies are limited. The Citizens Advice Bureau is updating its advice on this all the time.Q MY EMPLOYER has gone into administration. Can I still be furloughed A The law makes clear that administrators, independent professionals responsible for either salvaging a bankrupt company or ensuring creditors are paid, can apply to the government furlourgh scheme to ensure an income for staff. However, the administrator will probably focus on attempting to pay creditors and shareholders. Do not let them do this. Get together with co-employees and write to the administrator insisting you’ll not be forgotten and nor will their behaviour.Q I’VE HAD to cancel my holiday and my employer needs me to work during the time I had booked off. Usually we are not entitled to carry annual leave into the next year, butthey are requiring me to work, surely I must have the right to do so A Good news, the Government has amended regulations so workers can carry over up to four weeks holiday into the next two holiday years. This applies where it has not been possible for you to take some or all of your leave because of the virus. However, it has to be because you were required to work.Q I BECAME self-employed in February. Am I entitled to government grants A It looks like you are not, but this may change. You need to have accounts for   to be entitled to assistance. But this situation is moving, so don’t give up hope.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal Q I’M A zero-hours worker. Am I still entitled to be put on furlough  My employer is closed so I have no shts but nothing has been mentioned about furloughing. A The furlough scheme covers zero-hour contract workers so your employer should make an application on your behalf. Get in touch and ask them to explain their policy. It costs them nothing to offer you furlough so I do not understand why they have not.Q I WORK in a shop and my employer has made no effort to make the environment safe for the workers. In other shops I have seen screens at tills and employees issued with gloves and masks. We have none of that. I don’t feel safe. Am I entitled to stop working without risking my job A It is shocking that there are no specic health and safety regulations protecting workers like you which have the full force of law. I do not have a clear answer about whether you are entitled to refuse to go to workthe business is open and offering essential services. However, in due course your business failing to make the environment safe could be grounds for constructive dismissalyou were to make the decision to walk away. I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to write to your line manager asking them to provide safety equipment, making it clear the environment is unsafe and explaining that you will be considering your optionsadequate safety measures are not introduced.Q I WANT to go on furlough, but my employer has cut my hours by half. How can I make them furlough me so I can get  per cent of my pay instead of  per cent A Your boss can’t just slash your hours by half, that is a straightforward breach of contract. If there is no work for you to do then furlough should be offered to you. Write to your employer at once asking for them to explain why they think this is lawful. I look forward to their answer.Q I CAN’T work because I have to shield myself due to health reasons. I asked my employer to furlough me and they said they couldn’t because I can’t work, so I am currently on unpaid leave. Is this fair A  This all depends on your circumstances. If you are able to work from home, and are healthy enough to do so, your employer should offer you this option. If your employer is unable to operate, or there is no work you could doyou did not have to shield yourself, then you should be offered furlough. Butthe business is an essential service that has remained open, and you have to attend work in person, the remedy is to apply for statutory sick pay .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are talking about emerging from the lockdown, which signals a more gradual process.You dont exit viruses. That hasnt happened in all human history. They stay around, so we will be looking very closely at what happens in other countries that are ahead of us in the curve when they start to lt their own restrictions.Ministers face the challenge of trying to prevent a second wavethey act too quickly, but risk seeing the economy completely grind to a haltthey wait too long.Divisions are already opening up in the Cabinet about when is the best time to start easing off - some want to start on May , but others are urging them to wait until May .Another source said that some Brits could be too nervous to go out again - even when the lockdown measures are lted.One source told the paper: We wont be able to lt the lockdown until the public feels ready for it.We have to take the public with us, by unwinding the social distancing measures rather than stopping them suddenly, and its up to us to make the case for it.Here are some of the options for lting Britains three-week long shut down when the Government feels the evidence will show its safe to do so.Experts said in a study last week that the impact of closing schools on the spread of coronavirus was small anyway.Ministers were expecting around a fth of pupils to stay in school - just those of key workers - but in fact just  per cent are there at the moment.As parents struggle to work from home with their kids around and help them keep up with homework, going back to school would be a welcome first step for many to try and get back to some kind of normal.At the moment only food shops, DIY stores, banks and several other forms of essential shops are open.The Governments first step could be allowing more shops toto normal -they can try and keep some form of social distancing.Clothes and charity shops or other retailers could be added to the list of shops that are permitted to open their doors again and get back to normal.As younger people are less at risk from becoming seriously ill from the virus and are less likely to have enough savings to weather out the crisis, some experts have said younger people should be allowed toto normal le first.When coronavirus social distancing restrictions can be softened, they reckon --year-olds who no longer live with their parents should be released first.They are also more likely to be working in sectors where they cant work from home, and will rely on the economy opening up again for them to continue to work.Britain is still searching for an antibody tests to show whether people have had the bug in the past.Its hoped that once people have had it, they will be immune and not able to catch it again.If thats proven and a reliable test can be found, the Health Secretary has said he would look at issuing immunity certicates or wristbands - to allow people who have had the illness and recovered to go out safely.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealSome sectors could be allowed to go back to work first - including non-essential manufacturing and construction.Any jobs where people can show they can safely work apart are more likely to be able to start up again.EvenBritains rules dont allow for non-essential travel at the moment, Britain could relax rules on gatherings of more than two people.It could allow neighbours or friends and family to visit each other in small numbers, while keeping risks to a minimum.At the moment Brits are only allowed out for exercise, to get food, medicine, or take care of a vulnerable person.The Government could relax that by agreeing that people are able to go outside their own homes, and dont need a reason to be able to do so.This is likely to be the very last stage of the lockdown ending - and wont be on the cards anytime soon.Any events where people are packed in close spaces are likely to be put off until the number of cases has considerably dropped.To start with, pubs or restaurants could open again as take-away only - as some did in the early stages of the lockdown.Or sports matches could be played behind closed doors - with fans able to watch on TV instead. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

or even less - apart.It comes after cops cracked down on droves of sunbathing Brits in parks and beaches with megaphones as thousands soaked up the sun over the Easter weekend.Prof Dingwall instead urged the Government to relax their stringent lockdown rules and stop harassing sunbathers in parks.He told The : If it was entirely down to me I would be calling the dogs off.I don’t think it is appropriate to harass sunbathers.It is an indictment of the political and scientic elite that they are not recognising that people living in flats and social housing do not have an alternative to going to parks.And Prof Dingwall added that the chances of catching coronavirus through outdoor transmissions was extremely low.The probability for example of transmission from a jogger running past you is zero, he said.The senior advisor accused some mathematical modellers of promoting an “all or nothing” strategy on social distancing that was being pushed hard by the Government.He said the evidence basis for the need for two-metres’ social distancing was based on studies conducted indoors in laboratory conditions where the virus spread one metre.However, the distance had been doubled to two metres to offer further reassurance.Prof Dingwall sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , which advises the Government “on the threat posed by new and emerging respiratory viruses”.His comments were supported by another senior scientist, who advised the Government but did not wish to be named.The well-placed source said: I commissioned a rapid evidence synthesis on this topic.“We could find no positive evidence that this virus has ever been transmitted outdoors .The source did admit, however, that that does not mean outdoor transmission cannot occur - butsocial distancing is maintained then the risk of transmission in outdoor settings looks to be very low.Prof Dingwalls comments come ahead of a national review of the coronavirus lockdown this week.The lockdown is being reviewed by the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieswhich meets today and again on Thursday to consider its effectiveness, three weeks after it was announced by Boris Johnson.Public sunbathing in parks is currently against the UK governments strict coronavirus restrictions.At the moment, people are only allowed to leave their homes to travel to and from work for key workers only, shop for basic necessities, take one form of exercise a day, to go to a medical appointment or provide care to a vulnerable person.If youre lucky enough to have a garden that catches the sun then you are allowed to sunbathe, but friends and family who dont live in your household arent allowed to join you.You can be fined for sunbathing in a public space  - and for refusing to stay indoors are £, or £paid within  days.If you are caught a second time you will be fined £ and each time you do it again your fine will be doubled.Heath Secretary Matt Hancock reminded Brits they are allowed to leave the house to exercise but sunbathingis banned.Sunbathing is against the rules that have been set out for important public health reasons, told Sky News.I wish I didnt have to say this, but I do because the whole country wants to come through this crisis as quickly as possible and the fastest way to come through the crisis, and save lives and protect the NHS is... to follow the guidance and stay at home unless youve got one of the four reasons weve set out.Mr Hancock said the Government was allowing people to exercise outside on their own or with members of their household because of the positive benefits to your physical and your mental health, but he flagged further restrictionspeople broke the rules.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealIf the result of that is that too many people go out and flout the other rules because they say wellI can exercise then its fine for me to do other things then Im afraid we will have to take action, he said.If you dont want us to take the step to ban exercise of all forms outside the home, you have got to follow the rules.Lets not have a minority spoiling it for everybody.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

after analysing  patients who tested positive for Covid-.And the researchers found that infected people frequently experienced neurological effects in addition to and also independent of respiratory symptoms.Of those in the group,  per cent experienced some type of neurological symptom.Headache was reported in  per cent of the patients, dizziness was observed in about  per cent, and muscle inflammation and nerve pain occurred in about  per cent.In general, the more severe the infection got, the more frequent and intense the neurological complications became - with some experiencing confusion, seizure and stroke.Sometimes these symptoms were present in tandem with respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or fever.However, in other instances, people experienced the neurological symptoms alone with no signs of respiratory distress.Health experts say it is not surprising that Covid- can trigger neurological symptoms - especially when you look back at previous strains of coronavirus including severe acute respiratory syndromeand Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus .Both SARS and MERS affected the central nervous system of some patients - triggering le-threatening neurological complications including strokes, seizures, encephalitis and meningitis.It is also not unheard of to see neurological complications, from headaches and trouble concentrating to strokes and seizures, in people with other respiratory illnesses like the flu or pneumonia.As it is with most things related to Covid-, scientists are still in the very early stages of collecting data that fully makes sense of what’s happening in the central nervous system.However, its not far off to assume that could happen with Covid-, too.Health experts say the deadly bug may be causing neurological problems as the virus latches onto a receptor in our bodies called ACE-, which is primarily located in the lungs.However, according to Igor Koralnik, chief of neuroinfectious diseases and global neurology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, ACE- is also present in other parts of the body, including the nervous system and vessels going to the brain.The other potential mechanism behind the neurological symptoms is called a secondary infection, which means that a person’s respiratory infection is putting so much strain on the body that it’s triggering a major neurological problem.“For example,somebody has dficulty breathing and they don’t get enough oxygen in their body and their brain, then they will have altered mental ,” Koralnik told HuffPost.Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, two severe complications observed in people with Covid-, can cause multiple organ failure, which can damage the brain.“The brain is the organ that suffers the most from lack of oxygen,” Koralnik said.If you do not have any other symptoms along with your headache then it is highly unlikely that you have coronavirus.The NHS will not test you for coronavirus on the basis of a headache alone.If you have abnormal headaches, or they are particularly bad, then it is still wise to seek medical advice via the NHS  online service.As well as neurological symptoms, doctors have also warned that a loss of taste or smell could also be a sign of coronavirus.The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology, which represents experts in ear, nose and throat medicine, has said that those who lose these senses should self-isolate immediately - evenyou have no other symptoms.They added that the eye infection conjunctivitis may also be another sign.Other signs of coronavirus may include fatigue and muscle soreness.Around one out of every six who gets Covid- become seriously ill and develops dficulty breathing, according to the World Health Organisation .Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are at most risk developing serious illness.Despite this, on the complete other end of the spectrum, doctors say some people with coronavirus might not even show symptoms at all.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealAndyou dont show any symptoms -

and for concocting vaccines and treatments to stop its spread.Studies have linked pangolins and snakes so far, but now a team in Canada have suggested a scenario where the coronavirus first spread from bats to stray dogs, eating bat meat, before jumping to humans late last year.Lead author, Professor Xuhua Xia said the specic origins of Sars-Cov- are of vital interest in the current world health crisis.But, other experts have questioned the latest theory.Prof James Wood, head of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge said dog owners should not be concerned by the new findings.He said: I dont see anything in this paper to support this supposition and am concerned that his paper has been published in this journal.Prof Wood criticised the study for relying on far too much inference and far too little data.Prof Xia, a biologist at the University of Ottawa, said their new hypothesis suggests that the nearest ancestor of Sars-Cov- - caused by a bat coronavirus - infected the intestines of dogs.This most likely resulted in a rapid evolution of the virus and its jump into humans, he said.This suggests the importance of monitoring Sars-like coronaviruses in feral dogs in the fight against Covid-.Pangolins - a scaly mammal that looks like an anteater - were previously believed to have provided the key staging post, and in the earliest stages of the outbreak snakes were suspected as the vector animal.However, a complex analysis of Sars-Cov- genetic mutations has ruled both out as the intermediary.The viruses found in both pangolins and snakes are too ergent from Sars-Cov- to be make them the culprit.Prof Xia explained that humans and mammals can fight viruses thanks to a key antiviral protein called Zap.It prevents the infection from multiplying, while parts of the DNA called CpG dinucleotides direct the immune system to attack the virus.But single-strand coronaviruses can avoid the bodys natural defences by reducing CpG, in a similar fashion to HIV.In his study, published in Molecular Biology and Evolution, Prof Xia analysed all , full- betacoronavirus genomes deposited into the open access GenBank database.He said that Sars-Cov- and its closest known relative, a bat coronavirus , which shares  per cent sequence similarity, have the lowest amount of CpG among its close coronavirus relatives.Only genomes from canine coronaviruses, which have already caused a highly contagious intestinal disease worldwide in dogs, have similar genomic values, according to the study.Dogs also have coronaviruses which affect their respiratory systems as well as their digestive systems, but the digestive kind has much lower CpG values, the paper notes.The cellular receptor for Sars-Cov- entry into the cell is called ACE, which is pervasively expressed in the human digestive system ... with relatively low expression in the lung, the study says.It adds: This is consistent with the interpretation that the low CpG in Sars-Cov- was acquired by the ancestor of Sars-Cov- evolving in mammalian digestive systems.The interpretation is further corroborated by a recent report that a high proportion of Covid- patients also suffer from digestive discomfort.In fact, . per cent presented with digestive symptoms as their chief complaint.In particular, live Sars-Cov- virus was isolated from the stool of a Covid- patient.In this context, it is signicant that BatCoV RaTG ... was isolated from a fecal swab.These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that Sars-Cov- has evolved in mammalian intestine or tissues associated with the intestine.A study of the first  patients in the US found one reported diarrhoea as the initial symptom before developing fever and cough.Stool samples from seven out of ten tested positive for Covid-, including three with diarrhoea.Dogs are often observed to lick their anal and genital regions, not only during mating but also in other circumstances.Such behaviour would facilitate viral transmission from the digestive to the respiratory system.It also fits the picture of a pathogen that causes gastrointestinal, respiratory and lung disease.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal Nearly two million people have contracted Sars-Cov- since it first appeared at a seafood market in Wuhan, China, in late , according to a global tracker by Johns Hopkins University.More than , people have died after developing Covid-, the disease caused by the virus.Its not the first time bats have been the source of deadly viruses that have jumped to humans.Ebola, rabies and Sars all originated in bats, the  Sars outbreak was caused by the virus jumping from horseshoe bats to civets before infecting humans.Cases of Covid- first emerged in December and were linked to a wet market in Wuhan, China, where wild animals including marmots, birds, rabbits, bats and snakes, are traded illegally.Experts warn these horric sites are a “ticking time bomb” and could lead to a new disease much like Covid- which has swept the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A YEAR ago I was so ill I had to drag myself to the doctor. He said it was coronavirus. Would I have been the first to have got it A.     You were diagnosed with a viral infection caused by “a” coronavirus. But that would not have been the coronavirus causing the pandemic. Just like there are dferent strains of influenza, there are dferent strains of coronaviruses.Q.    WOULD you suggest a universal vaccination for all A. Pandemic infection sweeps the world over a period of time but a percentage of the global population will escape exposure. They will have no immunity however, and will need the vaccine more than those who have since recovered from the natural infection.Evenwe develop reliable antibody tests, we won’t have enough to test everybody and will therefore not know who is immune and who isn’t.For that reason, universal vaccination for everybody will be the target.Q. WHAT advice have you got for people with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer who are awaiting organ removal A.     You probably feel you are caught between a rock and a hard place. You need your surgery for pancreatic cancer, yet you know that many operations have had to be cancelled and that the risk of going to hospital and getting the virus outweighs the risk of staying home just now.You are much saferyou stay at home and physically distance yourself from everyone other than the people in your household.Q.     I HAVE silent reflux and one of the symptoms is a cough.

Government borrowing may also soar to its highest since the Second World War, with a £billion leap. Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned he “could not protect every business” and added: “These are tough times and there will be more to come.” But he insisted there will be a quick “bounce back”. Covid- UK deaths rose by  yesterday to , Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned many businesses could collapse with Britain heading for a summer of economic ­misery. The Office for Budget Responsibility said unemployment may hit . million – the highest since the dark days of Margaret Thatcher – and government borrowing faces a £billion hike. And with the UK’s Covid- death toll rising by  to ,, ministers are tomorrow expected to extend the lockdown by three weeks. That will leave many struggling ­businesses fearing for their survival, with the economy possibly shrinking by a third. And only % of firms affected have accessed the government loans scheme. But the OBR insisted there would be a “bounce-back” later in the year. Mr Sunak admitted he was “deeply troubled” by the figures and said the coronavirus will have “serious ­implications” for the economy. He added: “These are tough times and there will be more to come. We can’t protect every business or every household but we came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses. “While those economic impacts are signicant, the OBR also expects them to be temporary.” The OBR said government borrowing, which stood at £.billion last month could reach % of GDP. It added: “That would be the largest single-year deficit since the Second World War. The net effect of the coronavirus impact and the policy response is likely to be a sharpincrease in ­government borrowing that will leave public sector net debt permanently higher as a share of GDP.” The OBR feared national debt would surge beyond % of GDP, before ending the year at %. The most recent pre-pandemic prediction was %. The Resolution Foundation think-tank warned the economy was heading for its biggest annual fall in GDP in  years – when the war of Spanish succession in  and Western Europe’s great frost three years later hit hard. Chief executive Torsten Bell said: “The UK is ­experiencing a deeper recession than we have seen for three centuries and is on course for the highest borrowing since the war. While driven by the ­Government’s twin decisions to close down large swathes of our economy and offer ­unprecedented support to firms and families, its actual cause is the coronavirus outbreak itself. “This should caution against those arguing policymakers can avoid these costs by ending the lockdown.” A British Chambers of Commerce survey found only % of businesses had successfully accessed the ­Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme. One in three have put between % and % of staff on furlough, the scheme which covers % of salaries up to £, a month. BCC director general Dr Adam Marshall said: “Businesses on the front line need cash to start flowing from support schemes, fast. “With April’s payday coming up, we are approaching a crunch point, and both the furlough scheme and CBILS ­facilities need to be accelerated. “Any delay could mean more ­livelihoods under threat, more ­business failures, and more hardship in our communities.” The BCC said cash flow also remains a concern, with more than half of firms reporting reserves of three months or less. Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: “It is absolutely critical the Government now does all it can to minimise the depth andof the economic impact from necessary anti-coronavirus measures.”  The OBR warned . million people could end up jobless – adding to the . million already out of work. That will top the . million thrown on the scrapheap by Mrs Thatcher’s savage economic policies. Despite the likely extension of the lockdown until at least May , debate rages over when schools could reopen. Children are among the ­least affected by Covid-, but it is unclear whether parents would be willing to risk sending their kids back. And teaching unions insisted staff and pupil safety remained key before anycould be considered.

The silent pressures on communities across the country cannot be underestimated.” He urged Mr Raab to commit to setting out the criteria the Government will use to inform how and when it intends to ease the lockdown to publish the exit strategy now or in the coming week and to outline the sectors and core public services that are most likely to see restrictions eased.

They suggested that lower priority parliamentary business should be sidelined to increase the ability of MPs to hold Boris Johnson and his Government to account.Professor Meg Russell, from University College London, and Dr Ruth Fox, from the Hansard Society think- tank, said any changes must be temporary and should not be used to sht power away from Parliament to the Government. Commons business will resume on April  after an extended Easter break, despite calls for an early recall. Prof Russell, director of the constitution unit at UCL, and Dr Fox suggested that as far as possible MPs should stay away from Westminster in the interests of safety and to set a national example. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has already suggested that MPs should be allowed to participate in proceedings virtuallythe physical presence of members, or too many members, in the palace is not appropriate. The suggestions from Prof Russell and Dr Fox include:The introduction of electronic voting The ability to have three or four urgent questions, lasting up to  minutes each, every sitting day Giving MPs the chance to ask follow-up questions at Prime Ministeraposs Questions An increased frequency in appearances by the Prime Minister, or whoever is deputising for him as he recovers from coronavirus, before the Liaison Committee The possible introduction of a Coronavirus Select Committee.The pair acknowledged that a sht to a virtual Parliament may present dficulties for media coverage. But they argued thatlive broadcast is temporarily compromised, that may be a necessary price to pay - and committees have already experimented with delayed broadcasts and video clips. Prof Russell said: There is clearly a widespread desire to get Parliament up and running again, and members will be keen to co-operate and will hopefully be flexible, accepting that virtual working will require some compromises. But itaposs really, really important that the Government does not just present members with a fait accompli - there needs to be proper consultation, and any changes should be strictly time-limited, with opportunities for feedback and regular review. Dr Fox said: Adversarial party politics rightly takes a back seat in a time of national crisis, but Parliamentaposs collective responsibility to hold the executive to account is enduring. Extraordinary arrangements are neededParliament is to go fully aposvirtualapos. But any new arrangements must ensure fair representation for all members and parties and the crisis and Parliamentaposs response to it should not become a pretext to sht power even further towards the executive. The Government is expected to set out its approach for Parliamentaposslater this week.

The Chancellor warned of tough times to come for Brits amid fears more than two million people could lose their jobs and the economy may fall off a clf edge because of the coronavirus lockdown. The Office for Budget Responsibilitysaid unemployment could hit . million - up from . million - leaving around one in  of the working population without a job, while the economy may shrink by % between April and June. The Resolution Foundation think-tank warned the economy was heading for its biggest annual fall in GDP in  years – when the war of Spanish succession in  and Western Europe’s great frost three years later hit hard. Elsewhere, the International Monetary Fund [IMF] projected that the global economy would suffer its worst year since the Great Depression in the s, shrinking by an estimated %. Rishi Sunak emphasised it was just one possible scenario. He said not every business or household could be protected, but that a bounceback in growth was expected when the crisis eases. For live updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.        It came as the death toll for patients in hospital who tested positive for coronavirus rose above ,, while ministers faced pressure from Labour to publish their lockdown exit strategy this week. In its first estimate of the economic toll taken by the crisis, the OBR said public sector net borrowing is expected to increase by £ billion this year, compared with March forecasts, hitting £ billion, or % of GDP. That would be the largest single-year deficit since the Second World War, the independent forecaster said. The sharp rise in borrowing this year largely reflects the impact of economic disruption on receiptsand policy measures that add to public spending . It based the outlook on a scenario where the lockdown lasts three months followed by a partial lting for three months, but said, in this case, that there would be a sharp bounceback in the economy, with gross domestic product likely to jump % in the third quarter and a further % in the final three months of . Mr Sunak told the daily Downing Street press conference: These are tough times and there will be more to come. As I have said before, we cannot protect every business and every household. But we came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses.  So while those economic impacts are signicant, the OBR also expects them to be temporary, with a bounceback in growth. It came as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer added his voice to calls for the Government to publish its exit strategy from the lockdown this week. In a letter to Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson, Sir Keir said Labour would support the Government , as is expected, it keeps the current measures in place. But he said: The question for Thursday therefore is no longer about whether the lockdown should be extended, but about what the Governmentaposs position is on how and when it can be eased in due course and on what criteria that decision will be taken. A Government source said talk of an exit strategy before the UK has reached the peak risks confusing the critical message that people need to stay at home in order to protect our NHS and save lives. On Tuesday, figures released by the Office for National Statistics showed that , people died in England and Wales in the week to April  - an increase of , deaths compared with the previous week and , more than the five-year average.

The Government has issued a notice to proceed to the companies that will build phase one of the high-speed railway.Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave the green light for HS in February despite it running tens of billions of pounds over budget and several years behind schedule.The Government-commissioned Oakervee Review warned that the final bill could reach £ billion at  prices.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced there is finally enough capacity after weeks of complaints care homes were being left behind. It comes after Downing Street prompted fury by admitting just  social care workers had been tested for the virus. And until today, only the first five symptomatic residents in a care home setting were being tested - simply to provide confirmation of whether there is an outbreak. Labouraposs Shadow Minsiter for Social Care Liz Kendall said: “Increased testing for care home residents and care staff is essential to tackling the emerging crisis in social care and something Labour has long been calling for. We look forward to seeing details of how this latest commitment will be delivered, with only  care staff having been tested to date.” Professor Martin Green OBE, Chief Executive of Care England, added: “During this dreadful pandemic it is hard to find things to be positive about, but today’s announcement from DHSC that testing will be available for all social care staff and residents that need it is indeed welcome. For live updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  Care homes will be in a much better position to face this virus head on once they have been able to test both their staff, residents and new residents who have been discharged from hospital into their care homes”. All care home residents and social care staff with Covid- symptoms will be tested for the virus as capacity increases, the Government pledged.  Testing will also be provided to all potential residents before they are discharged from hospital, the Department of Health and Social Care said.Helen Whately, the Minister for Care, said more than , care workers have now been tested for coronavirus and more than , have been referred for tests. She told Sky News: The testing is in progress. Over the next few days the Care Quality Commission is going to be phoning up nearly , care providers in order to identy who they need testing and start lining up people for tests. Mr Hancock said: I am deeply conscious that people in residential care are among the most vulnerable to coronavirus. We are doing everything we can to keep workers, residents and their families safe. We have already begun testing social care workers and will roll this out nationwide over the coming days. And as we continue to ramp up our testing programme, we will test all current care home residents with coronavirus symptoms and all new care home residents who are discharged from hospital into care. The announcement of the rollout follows intense criticism of the Governmentaposs treatment of the social care sector, with claims it has been forgotten as the disease spread. Labouraposs shadow minister for social care Liz Kendall has said social care needs a much greater priority and focus than it has had so far. Increases in the laboratory capacity have opened up the chance for the Government to expand testing to include all care home residents who develop symptoms, the DHSC said. Testing is vital to calculating accurate infection and survival rates. All of the examinations will be PCRtests, which search for the presence of Covid- in a sample. The Care Quality Commission , which is coordinating testing for the care sector, aims to have contacted , care providers by the end of the week. It has already offered , care facilities the opportunity to test their staff. Care providers will then identy workers eligible for testing and refer them to their local testing centre. Mr Hancock is set to give further details of the measures when the Governmentaposs Covid- social care action plan is outlined this week. The Government has already pledged to perform , coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.

Among those applauding have been Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and other senior Tory ministers. Because of this, thousands have shared a  story - including on the Mirror - that showed Tory MPs cheering as they blocked a full pay rise for nurses.The story isnapost fake news: Tory MPs did vote down a proper pay rise for nurses in  and they did cheer when the vote was announced. However, itaposs inevitable that some details are lost in translation or over the passage of time. So as a public service, hereaposs what you need to know about the vote. What happened on  June  Tory and DUP MPs defeated a Labour amendment to the  Queenaposs Speech in the House of Commons.Among other things, the amendment aimed to call on the Government to end the public sector pay cap and give the emergency and public services a fair pay rise. However, it was voted down by  votes to .  Tory MPs and  DUP MPs voted against the amendment.In favour were  Labour MPs,  SNP MPs,  Lib Dem MPs,  Plaid Cymru,  Green and  Independent.What was actually blocked     The amendment would not have given nurses and other NHS staff a legally binding pay rise. But it would have sent a powerful and, arguably, a morally binding signal that what they were getting wasnapost enough. At the time of the vote, annual pay rises for NHS staff were still capped at the % a year that theyaposd been since . The amendment also called for a number of other things - see below. So did the government refuse completely to give nurses a pay rise   No. Itaposs completely true that at the time of the vote, the government hadnapost confirmed any extra help for NHS staff other than a % rise every year. Thataposs why MPsapos decision angered many campaigners and NHS workers at the time. But the following year, in summer , the government did eventually confirm NHS staff would get a three-year deal worth between .% and %. Critics of the government would argue that it only changed its course because of years of pressure by Labour, including that vote on  June . Meanwhile, No officials had also made noises about changing policy on the day of the vote, only for their message to be mired in confusion.At pm, a Downing Street spokesman said then-PM Theresa May had heard the message of the election and would listen to pay reviews which have branded the cap unsustainable.But pressed for more detail at pm, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman in No then told journalists repeatedly: Our policy has not changed.    It depends who you ask. Labour would say itaposs because they didnapost have NHS staff high enough up their priority list - and werenapost prepared to help them after years of Tory austerity. Tories, on the other hand, accused Labour of using the issue as a political football by lumping in lots of other complaints into the amendment. The amendment couldnapost be split into dferent bits, so had to be either approved or rejected all in one go.Then-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said just before the vote: The party of the NHS is not the party that uses it to milk votes it is the party that fights to make it better for patients.And so it was that Tory whips ordered their MPs to vote against the amendment - and it was defeated. Itaposs worth saying the resounding result came despite some Tory MPs wanting to see nurses get a pay rise. One of them, former nurse Maria Caulfield, said nursesapos pay cannot be right and urged a complete rethink. Why did MPs cheer     The simple answer is - because they won. As explained above, the vote came at the end of a torturous day in Westminster where the debate descended into angry party politics. The government, which had a tiny working majority, was relieved to have won by a comfortable margin. So Tory MPs who cheered were gripped by that party-political excitement rather than deliberately putting across a message to NHS workers. But in doing so they created a scene that, in retrospect, appeared insulting and disrespectful to many NHS workers.

Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said .million claims for  Universal Credit  have now been made since the middle of March - around  times the usual average.On top of that, she said, there have been , claims for aposlegacyapos benefits Jobseekersapos Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance. Just , of the Universal Credit claimants have already received cash since March , after applying for an advance. Others are waiting for money to arrive because there is a five-week standard wait for first payment. The governmentaposs Universal Credit helpline has been struggling with the number of calls - including .million in the first week of Apri. Officials have been forced to quadruple capacity in some areas after being swamped with desperate new claimants to the six-in-one benefit. The figure included .million calls to the DWPaposs helpline on a single day, Monday  March.  Today the Chancellor was asked whether Universal Credit is a good enough safety net and,not, whether he is open to proposals such as Universal Basic Income. I donapost think Universal Basic Income is the right response to this.He added: I think Universal Credit is working well, obviously DWP staff are under strain like many other organisations across the country because theyaposre dealing with people being sick and away as well but I think, given the circumstances, they are processing claims efficiently and effectively.Weaposve provided some extra resource to DWP to help them with that but their staff do deserve praise for what theyaposre doing.  Weaposve also injected extra resources to deal with the particular nature of this crisis into the welfare system whether thataposs strengthening Universal Credit temporarily for this year, working tax credits or, indeed, local housing allowance, local council tax support - all of those interventions which will total several billions of pounds, he said. Because of the unprecedented nature of what weaposre facing will go to supporting the most vulnerable people in our country. Critics say the huge tide of benefit cases is because of holes in the governmentaposs support schemes. Self-employed people can get % of their average profits but the cash is only available in June. And people who started a new job after February  cannot get % of their wage under the governmentaposs furloughed workers scheme.During the daily Downing Street press conference Mr Sunak warned that there are tough times to come after a devastating report said two million jobs could be lost to the  coronavirus  lockdown.He said he was troubled by the projection - but said he was confident that the UK would bounce back quickly when the crisis is over. He said: These are tough times and there are more to come. Iaposve always said we canapost protect every business, and we canapost protect every household, but we came into this with a fundamentally sound economy.

The most common symptoms of the virus are a dry cough and high temperature - with the government saying anyone who experiences these must self-isolate for seven days. However, less common signs being reported by those infected include lesions on the feet, testicular pain and a strange aposbuzzingapos or aposfizzingapos sensation on the skin. Others have reported feeling increased levels of mental fatigue or aposbrain fogapos shortly before being diagnosed. Hereaposs a list of some of the less common symptoms that are being increasingly reported by sufferers: Follow all coronavirus updates here on our live blog Needing the toilet Another mild symptom of coronavirus that is being reported with increased regularity is the need to go to the toilet more often. Dr Diana Gall explained to the  Express : Digestion problems and changes in bowel habits - particularly looser stools and making more frequent trips to the toilet - are sometimes the first signs that you’re coming down with something, not just with this coronavirus. However, diarrhoea has been reported as an early symptom in patients who have later tested positive for Covid-. A new study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, analysed data  patients with Covid- in China’s Hubei province and found nearly  per cent had diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain. Testicular pain  Another slightly less common symptom of the coronavirus, is testicular pain. Researchers from Hard Medical School  filed a case report about a -year-old man who tested positive for the virus, after going to hospital with a ‘stabbing pain’ in his testicles. While doctors could find nothing wrong with his testicles, and CT scan showed damage in his lungs. Two days later, the man was diagnosed with Covid-. A buzzing sensation One of the more curious symptoms is a buzzing sensation that runs through the body. While it has not been listed as an official symptom to watch out for, many people have posted online about experiencing a aposfizzingapos feeling. Tarana Burke, recognised as the founder of the #MeToo movement, said that her partner had the illness and the sensation that his aposskin felt like it was burningapos. Twitter user @Miafia described having “an electric feeling on my skin.” Dr Daniel Grfin, chief of infectious disease at ProHealth Care Associates in the US, has suggested the feeling may be part of an auto-immune response to a patientsapos nervous system. “Clearly it’s been identied, but we’re just not sure yet how widespread it is,” he told the New York Post. Foot lesions  Medical experts in Spain are currently investigating whether those who have the virus could be identied by small lesions on the feet. Last Thursday, The Spanish General Council of Official Podiatrist Colleges shared a statement revealing that several  coronavirus  patients had lesions on their feet. The statement said: They are purple lesionswhich usually appear on the toes and normally heal without leaving a mark. They added that it was a curious finding which had also been observed in numerous  Covid- patients in Italy and France, as well as Spain, according to dermatologists and podiatrists. The lesions were more commonly noticed in younger people with the virus, including teenagers and children, although some adults were also found to have them. Tummy ache  As with a loss of appetite, enduring a tummy ache may easily be passed off as a sign of something more innocuous. However, a newly published study by the American Journal of Gastroenterology links tummy problems to Covid-. They found that .% of  people who have been infected by the coronavirus in Chinaaposs Hubei province had digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea that can cause tummy pain, A dry cough  Perhaps the most recognisable of the Covid- symptoms, given how dferent it can sound compared to a typical cough. The cough is generally new for you - or dferentyou generally have a smokeraposs cough - and persistant. More often than not it will last for at least half a day or longer. Loss of taste and smell Some of the infected have reported experiencing a lack of smell and taste – known as anosmia - despite not having the usual signs of a cough or fever. It is now believed to be a symptom for hidden carriers of Covid-. Professor Nirmal Kumar, head of ENT UK, has urged Britons to self-isolatethey have this symptom. He told Sky News: In young patients, they do not have any signicant symptoms such as the cough and fever, but they may have just the loss of sense of smell and taste, which suggests that these viruses are lodging in the nose. In a statement, ENT UK said: “There is already good evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that signicant numbers of patients with proven covid- infection have developed anosmia hyposmia . Mental fatigue or aposbrain fogapos  Although this has not been officially chalked up as a symptom, Covid- sufferers have reported experiencing mental fatigue. Thea Jourdan told the Mail  that she first thought she may have been infected when she got a tickle in her throat and a headache. The mum-of-three then began to experience brain fog. Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever, the Hampshire woman told the publication. But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder. Others have also reported struggling to hold on to thoughts or remember things throughout the day.  Itaposs dficult to catch your breath If your chest starts to feel tight or you cannot breath, you may have caught the coronavirus. Most young people or those without pre-existing health conditions are unlikely to experience this symptom. Dyspnea - the term for when someone has dficulty breathing - may be coupled with a tightness in the chest, rapid breathing and heart palpatations. A fever Although numbers y for dferent people, a rise in body temperature generally counts as a fever once it reaches .C . You can tell you have a feveryou feel hot to the touch on your chest or back. Sore eyes The best way to describe the sensation of burning eyes is to compare it with the itchiness and irritation you would faceyou suffer with hayfever or other allergies. This kind of itchiness and irritation can also come about when you’re among smog, smoke, dust, mold and even animals. The only dference between these cases and the cases described by coronavirus patients, is the fact that the virus triggers this symptom and not an external factor like pets. Headache and dizziness Researchers from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan have warned that a headache and dizziness could also be indicators that you’ve been infected.In their study, the researchers analysed  coronavirus patients, asking them about their initial symptoms."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus frontline workers cry happy","story":"NewsCoronavirus frontline workers cry ‘happy tears’ as volunteers print D face shieldsVolunteers D printed , protective face shields over the Easter weekend to support those on the coronavirus frontline with money donated by the public to the D Crowd UK campaignShareCommentsByPhoebe Davis:,  APR NewsToby Johnson, , is one of over  volunteers who have joined DCrowdUK \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Although D Crowd UK have fundraised £, through their GoFundMe page to support their efforts, it is not enough to keep up to the increasing demand.Gen Ashley, one of the leaders of  D Crowd UK, said: “The orders we’ve received from health and social care organisations demonstrate just how critical the shortage of protective equipment is for frontline workers in the UK. “We are hoping to produce more because we have already seen that the demand is greater than what we were aiming to do, and the crowdfunding needs to continue to get the material we need.” Ben Sauer, also on the DCrowd UK team, said: “We hear first-hand from those on the front line about how desperately they need this equipment and with the help of the volunteers we can really make a dference to people who are treating those worst affected by coronavirus.” The shields have been gratefully received by NHS workers, who have been sharing their support for the campaign on social media.Helen Kilminster, a pharmacist from Worcestershire tweeted that when she received a call from DCrowdUK telling her that  shields have been dispatched to her, she “Actually cried. Happy tears. Relieved tears.” Toby Johnson, , is one of over  volunteers who have joined DCrowdUK. He is staying up overnight and giving up his Easter break to print the face shields at his home in Surrey. Toby said: “It’s been amazing to work virtually with like-minded people who all share the same goal using modern technology to help the NHS in this current time.” In Yorkshire, engineers from the University of Sheffield are also working around the clock to print and distribute the protective face shields. Dr Pete Mylon, the project leader from the University’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, said: “Doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers across the country are in need of PPE. Many staff are anxious about not having the right equipment and potentially exposing themselves to infection.” The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK.

However, their trip took a turn for the worst as the coronavirus pandemic gripped the world. The family, from Sevenoaks in Kent, were originally put under House Arrest in Guachipas with Sebaaposs -year-old gran. This was an ordeal that Anna described as terrying.  She told KentLive : When we were under house arrest in Guachipas it was terrying to see police and a doctor arrive with masks and hand you a notice to prohibit your movements.We understand that quarantine is important but didnapost want to be with Sebaaposs -year-old gran in case we did have it. As it turns out we are virus free. The couple were later permitted to move to Salta to stay with Sebaposs sister-in-law. Quarantine in Salta is better as we are able to leave for essentials and we are in a more comfortable room, Anna added. Sharing with another family has its trials but we are eternally grateful to them for this. With flights currently cancelled from Salta, the nearest airport where the family can catch a flight back to England is from Buenos Aires - a full  hours away by coach. It is a journey that is further complicated due to them having their five-month-old baby with them. Anna explained: The biggest challenges of having a baby in this situation is not being able to take up the onlyflight options. Travel is too long and I am genuinely worried about her safety. We have tohome and I am worried about the journey home. I miss the privacy of my our own home. From there it is also easier to sort out finances, bills and correspond with banks. The family have been in contact with Tom Tugendhat, MP for Tonbridge and Mailling who has been helping them in their quest tohome. He told KentLive: I have been in contact with Anna and am doing all I can to make sure that she, and everyone  who is stranded abroad, can come home as quickly as possible.

According to the aposs royal expert Camilla Tominey, this was down to a clash of cultures as Meghan got to the grips with her new royal le.She told The New Yorker : I’ve put it down to a clash of cultures, in the sense that she had come from the celebrity world, which is very fast-paced and quite demanding.The royal world is very dferent - it’s much slower-paced, and hugely hierarchical.

Amy was handpicked to be the Duchessaposs assistant private secretary and accompanied her at official engagements and big events.

The young mumapos suffered  separate injuries during her horric ordeal which came to end after she managed to alert police before Hawkins smashed her phone and they stormed his flat in Rusholme, Manchester. Minshull Street Crown Court heard that the pair met on Facebook and began a relationship a few months later before things soured when Hawkins later became apospossessive and controllingapos, demanding to know where she was and who she was with. There were claims he had been violent towards her during an incident in July last year, but no further action was taken, Manchester Evening News reports. The victim had spent the weekend at his flat, and had planned to leave but agreed to stay longer after Hawkins was unwell. On the Tuesday morning after the weekend, at about am, Hawkins became aposaggressiveapos and said aposwhere do you think youaposre going apos when she tried to go home. Jurors heard the violence unfolded when Hawkins punched her to the back of the head, and a aposcatalogueapos of assaults followed. Prosecuting, Jonathan Savage said she was repeatedly struck to the head, kicked, spat at and had her hair pulled. She was strangled, and believed that at one point she had lost consciousness, and Hawkins told her that he was going to kill her, that she aposdeserved to dieapos and that he had aposnothing to loseapos.

This was before Hawkins smashed her mobile phone, so she couldnapost use it to aid her escape. When was able to take refuge in the bathroom, Hawkins broke in rom the outside of the flat and turned the shower on, so the bath filled up with water. Hawkins aposheld her face in the waterapos and told her he was going to kill her while trying to force her mouth open, he broke one of her teeth. He also strangled her, and she begged him to stop. Hawkins left the bathroom briefly, before ing. She believed he was going to kill her at this point, Mr Savage said. At about .pm, the police arrived. After realising officers were outside, Hawkins told her to tell them that she had decided to have a shower with her clothes on, to explain why she was wet. He told her to keep quiet, and warned thatshe didnapost aposhe would make her famousapos. Police stormed the flat and found the bruised and battered victim on the floor. The flat was in aposdisarrayapos, with a broken TV, pieces of a broom and her phone on the floor, all of which Hawkins had used to attack her. An ashtray was also used as a weapon. The victim suffered  separate injuries, and in a statement summarised to the court, said she will aposnever forget that dayapos. Mr Savage said that the woman had described Hawkins as a aposmonsterapos, and said she aposfirmly believed that she was going to dieapos.

Industry body TechUK, whose hundreds of members include Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, reportedly urged the Government to “look again” at the Digital Services Tax. One of its top bosses claimed firms need “more breathing space” as Covid- meant “resources are stretched and revenue uncertain.” Yet they are faring far better than bricks and mortar companies, which face weeks of closure from which they may not recover. As physical shops feel the full force of lockdown, Amazon, which already had a huge advantage due to business rates, has seen a boom in sales. Workers at its UK warehouses are doing overtime to tackle a huge surge in orders. And Facebook is in prime position to cash in on increased virtual socialising, while thousands of pubs, restaurants remain shuttered. It has also been blasted over fake claims shared by users including that “If you can hold your breath for ten seconds, then you don’t have the virus.” Facebook-owned WhatsApp is attempting to tackle the issue and has launched a website to combat miss-information surrounding the pandemic.  Social media in general has also been used to spread the fake claim that G causes coronavirus. TechUK insisted today it had “not lobbied Government to delay the introduction” of the DST. But Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge said: “It is an obscene exploitation of a global crisis, when people are dying and public services are stretched. “I have never heard such arrogance, it’s awful to use a global crisis to further their cause.” The tax came into force on April , with a % levy on revenues of search engines, social media and online marketplaces which “derive value from UK users”.  It is aimed at “established tech giants” rather than start-ups, with the Treasury forecasting it will raise £million this year, rising to £million by  . Antony Walker, deputy chief executive of TechUK, is quoted as saying: “The scope of the tax was dramatically extended last month, meaning HMRC now expects many more companies to begin allocating resources to determine liability. “This is all at a time when, due to Covid-, resources are stretched and future revenue is uncertain. “The government is creating a large degree of uncertainty. It would therefore be wise to seek to look again at how the tax has been designed and how and when it should be implemented.”  Paul Monaghan, head of the Fair Tax Mark, said: “The lobbying of Google, Facebook and TechUK, are reminiscent of the two-faced whisperings in the shadows of Big Tobacco over recent decades. They are lobbying in the UK to kill the Digital Services Tax, which is already pretty weak-kneed at just %. “More signicantly, they are lobbying abroad to undermine new international tax rules. “These are looking to end disgraceful profit-shting the likes of Google excel at, which are costing the UK £billion a year.” TechUK said in a statement it “has not lobbied Government to delay the introduction of DST in response to Covid-.” "},{"url":null,"title":"teen who mistook coronavirus asthma","story":"NewsTeen who mistook coronavirus for asthma shares dark warning about symptomsBrandon Fay, , feared he would die alone in a hospital after his quick decline and he is urging teenagers to stay inside until it is safe toto normalShareCommentsByDarragh BerrySam Elliott:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video terried-woman-says-caught-coronavirus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news teen-who-mistook-coronavirus-asthma-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Brandon Fay, from Dublin, Ireland, has spoken about his terrying experience and says he didnapost think he would pull through. The -year-old went into Mater Hospital after contracting the killer bug and has now pleaded with other youngsters to take it seriously. The teen revealed the brutal symptoms which saw him rushed to hospital within  minutes after being tested during a routine check up. He told Dublin Live : I don’t know how I contracted it and don’t think half of the people who have it or had it will know where they have got it from. It’s a virus, you can’t see it. I got my first symptoms on Wednesday th March and went for a regular routine check-up in the hospital on the th. I had a cough and was very short of breath but I just thought it was my asthma acting up. I thought it was pollen in the air but my consultant heard me coughing and got me checked by a nurse. My blood pressure and O levels were high and within  minutes I was isolated on a ward. I couldn’t eat, I lost my appetite, I was finding it hard to breath and was very short of breath. I wasnapost in ICU though so I had no special machinery attached to me. I spent three days in isolation alone and another three days in a ward with two other men who also had COVID -. I was extremely nervous, I felt isolated from the world as nobody could come visit me or see me. Brandon said the staff at the Mater Hospital were phenomenal. He continued: The only people who could come in were nurses and doctors, it was a terrying experience. But the staff at the Mater Hospital treated me like one of their own children and comforted me when I needed them most. They are phenomenal and the work they are doing is just incredible. In my opinion in  drop the Grammy awards and IFTA awards and every award show you can think of and award every frontline staff out there. Within a couple of days, Brandon was released from hospital with healthcare staff able to check up on him while he continued to isolate at home. He added: After my few days in hospital I was released home as I had my own bedroom and bathroom to isolate in and was given a pulse oximeter which connected to my mobile through Bluetooth. This allowed me to check my heart rate and oxygen levels which would send the results directly to the hospital to keep an eye on me.  Dark thoughts continued to run through Brandonaposs head for the duration of his time in the hospital as he battled the terrying virus.

Grafters on low and middle incomes, hard-working small business owners and families who were struggling to keep their heads above water already must also be spared. When we come out of this coronavirus crisis, it would be disastrous to repeat the foolish mistakes of . Then, Conservative austerity was a political choice which snuffed out a promising economic recovery, squeezed wages and sunk the NHS on to its knees. Two million extra unemployed and soaring public debt require calm heads… not panic. New visions… not bankrupt Tory cuts. Investing in the future… not yet more slashing. If they adopt a strategy to grow our way out of what can still be a temporary ­recession, then we can genuinely all be in this together. The rich must pay more in tax, of course. But to make le tougher for nurses, care home workers, cleaners, bus drivers and shop workers would be a cruel slap in the face.

Some have been entirely asymptomatic, meaning they show no signs of Covid-, but have tested positive, while others can experience symptoms ranging from mild to those which require emergency care.Many people who have experienced mild symptoms, including a fever, fatigue, dry cough, shortness of breath, and loss of taste and smell, but havenapost been tested may suspect they have already had coronavirus.The problem is the milder symptoms can mirror those experienced with more common illnesses, like a cold, making it dficult to diagnose. Dr William Hillmann, an associate inpatient physician director at Massachusetts General Hospital, explains that the only way to tellsomeone has already had coronavirus would be with an antibody test. It would allow experts to check blood samples for antibodies against the virus, but these are still being developed and are not yet in widespread clinical use.Dr Hillmann told: I, and I think many others, are anxiously awaiting for those to become available. He explains that even those who have had coronavirus with no symptoms are still contagious for a period of time, but aposwe just donapost know for how long at this pointapos. People who may believe they have coronavirus should act no dferently to those who donapost, for the safety of themselves and others around them.

Keep doing all of those things that we all should be doing at this point: social distancing and hand hygiene.

Citizen journalists Chen Quishi and Fang Bin disappeared in February after uploading videos showing the devastation the killer bug was having in Wuhan. While doctor Ai Fen was unreachable from March , she was apparently confirmed to be working again at Wuhan Hospital this weekend. This comes as China imposed restrictions on the publication of academic research on the origins of Covid-, according to a central government directive and notices published by two Chinese universities, which have since been removed. For live updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    President of Reporters Without Borders, Pierre Haski, told Le Parisian there is very little information about what happened to the missing pair but said the only certainty is they are in the hands of the Chinese authorities. Human rights lawyer Mr Quishi, , had captured disturbing footage inside a Wuhan hospital in February showing how overwhelmed staff were with the influx of patients. He had previously uploaded other videos and in one posted on January , revealed he was scared - apparently stuck in between the virus and the authorities. On February  his Weibo account was deleted and the next day his parents were told he had been put in quarantine despite having had no symptoms of the virus. There has been no sign of him since. Similarly, Mr Bin, a clothing store manager, published a five-minute video on February  showing what he claimed to be eight corpses of patients found in front of or inside a Wuhan hospital. The video reached over one million views. His laptop was subsequently confiscated by police after a y interrogation. Mr Fenaposs video on February  showed men in protective suits trying to enter his home, while no other videos have been uploaded since February . “His family remains, to this day, without news, said Mr Haski. Questions also remain around emergency director of Wuhan Hospital, Dr Fen, another virus activist - though she has been confirmed to have since been back at work. The doctor was apparently silenced two weeks after criticizing the regimeaposs censorship of the coronavirus epidemic in a Chinese magazine last month. If the two other whistle-blowers were arrested, the mystery remains about this last case, claims Mr Haski. He said there is again absolutely no information as to what happened to her or where she was, but suggested she could have simply gone to ground. Mr Haski said it is much more dficult for the Chinese authorities to send a doctor to prison than the other two whistle-blowers, for example.  On Monday, a French journalist reported having spoken to Dr Fen at the hospital in Wuhan. She is doing very well, she is at her post, said Arnauld Miguet on Twitter, showing a photo of the director. Mr Haski said there are two possible outcomes for the two missing civilian journalists. One is that the authorities keep them hidden until the crisis dies down in a few weeks, but he said this remains unlikely. The other scenario he said is that in about six months time we suddenly hear they have been indicted for subversion. Whataposs more, Ren Zhiqiang, a former businessman close to vice president Wang Qishan, has been missing since March  after publicly criticising the regimeaposs lack of transparency in its handling of the crisis.  He had apparently compared president Xi Jinping to a tyrannical clown. On Tuesday it was announced he was being sought by the authorities as the target of an investigation. Mr Haski said any potential trials will likely be held behind closed doors with sentences dictated by the Chinese Communist Party. In relation to the new restrictions on academic publications, all such papers will be subject to extra vetting and must be approved by the government, according to now removed posts, reports CNN. The virus has so far claimed more than , lives and infected around . million worldwide. One Hong Kong medical expert claimed research he was involved in did not undergo the new levels of scrutiny back in February when it was published. Chinese researchers have been publishing studies since late January with some findings raising questions over the governmentaposs accounts of the crisis. The Chinese authorities now appear to be clamping down on what is released into the public domain.

Video released by Chinese state media suggests itaposs business as usual after the lockdown was lted in the epicentre of the pandemic. It is claimed that % of stalls are operating once again at the huge Baishazhou market - although selling live wild animals and livestock is now banned. The sprawling market covers an area of  acres. It is thought Covid-, which has killed more than , people, originated in another wet market in the city of Wuhan, called Huanan. Huanan has been closed since January .New steps have been taken though in light of the outbreak, with visitors to Baishazhou having to show proof on an app that they have not tested positive for coronavirus.Their temperatures are also taken on entry, according to local media. The market is the biggest trading place for live crayfish in China, although state media reports that sales are currently a quarter of their previous level. Customer numbers are also just % of those a year ago as le gets back to normal in the city, it is claimed.  Among those critical of the reopening is Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who branded it unfathomable. He told Nine Network TV: We need to protect the world against potential sources of outbreaks of these types of viruses. Itaposs happened too many times. Iaposm totally puzzled by this decision. I think thataposs unfathomable, frankly.  However the World Health Organisation has said itaposs ok for the markets to reopen.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted. In the UK, police officers have taken to standing guard at supermarkets to halt coronavirus panic-buying and enforce the Governmentaposs social distancing orders. Supermarkets have been imposing new measures to keep staff and shoppers safe, including cough screens to shield workers at checkouts, and using pub bouncers to keep things orderly.

In fact, she#s the sort of person -year-oldme would have loved to have met on my first day at Edinburgh University eight years ago.Although she might not have been able to help me, she has given support to thousands of other students who have passed through the doors of Dundee University over the years.Excluding a -week period in  when Muriel retired # we#ll get to that in a bit # she has been a permanent fixture at the university. In October , she started as a clerical assistant at the faculty of science.At that time the department did #everything# as far as students were concerned, including dealing with inquiry and admissions letters. She stayed in the role until , before moving into a position working directly with postgraduate students.#I loved it,# she explains. #I really enjoyed all the work with overseas students.# Muriel witnessed plenty of changes in the years that followed postgraduate student numbers soared from around  in the early s to , at the turn of the century and new buildings sprung up around the campus.#We moved from Cross Row, onto the seventh floor of the Tower Building, before ending up at Airlie Place,# she says. The busiest time of the year was always that four-month period between June and October, as the team worked constantly to ensure the admissions process ran smoothly.#It was just mad during that time. I was working a lot of overtime, coming to work in the evenings and catching up but I thoroughly enjoyed it.#There were four of us working in the office at one point. We all worked brilliantly together and did each other favours. We still all keep in contact two of them are still at the university.#In  Muriel made the decision to retire, but only managed  weeks before ing to work # this time in a dferent role. She#d passed a remark to a colleague, around six months prior to her retirement, about an ambition to work on the university reception at one stage.#And then, after I was away for  weeks, I got a phone call one morning and he said to me #you once said that you would like to work in the reception. Well, we#re looking for someone now.# ##When can I start # I replied. He said to me, #I think you need to discuss that with your husband# and I said #oh there#ll be no discussion,# she tells me, laughing hysterically.I ask her why she retired in the first place. #I think I just needed a break,# she says.#They were wanting to expand things and change things and they probably felt #well that old soul won#t change.# I felt it was maybe time to hang up the reins and let someone  have an opportunity.# Now, Muriel works part-time from Monday to Friday and loves every second of it. #It#s good to meet people and I think that when you#re older, you need something like this,# she says.#This sitting around the house would drive me mad. We were off for two weeks over Christmas and on that weekend before ing to work, my husband asked me #what are you thinking about going back to work # I said #oh, I can#t wait.#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/c79f215c-5676-43bf-be5c-3d2fbe98c54f-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/c79f215c-5676-43bf-be5c-3d2fbe98c54f-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/c79f215c-5676-43bf-be5c-3d2fbe98c54f-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/c79f215c-5676-43bf-be5c-3d2fbe98c54f-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"a job for life loyalty to boots has kept mo in her dream role for 40 years","story":"For Maureen McCabe, working as a pharmacy delivery driver is pretty much a dream job. The -year-old recently celebrated  years service at Boots and can#t quite put her finger on what it is that has kept her at the company for so long.She thinks it#s a combination of factors from her love of driving and passion for working with prescriptions, to her friendships with colleagues and relationships with staff working in the surgeries and shops across the city.I ask Maureenshe remembers the date of when she first started working at Boots. It#s clear it is etched in her memory as she tells me without faltering: #January st . I started as a sales assistant in Lochee before moving onto the chemist counter, approximately two years later.#After that, Maureen transferred to the site#s store on Reform Street where she worked on the photo-lab and in the children#s department.Finally, she found her calling and took on the #cushy# van driver role. She#s now been doing that job for  years, and hasn#t looked back once.#I love my job. For some reason, I#ve always loved working with prescriptions picking them up from doctor surgeries and delivering them to stores across the city,# she says.#The thing about this job is you maintain great relationships with the surgeries and shops and you feel really close to all their members of staff.#I#m very loyal to Boots because they#ve treated me so well over the years. Plus, we all work as a team I#m always having a gossip with my colleagues. Instead of getting called Maureen, they call me Mo. There are only two people amongst the shops and surgeries that call me by my actual name. When I come back after a week#s holiday a lot of them say, #oh we#re glad to see you back Mo.# I just love it.#The Monieth resident, who works Monday to Friday from around am to pm, has always gone above and beyond in her role.#The customers used to come in and say #I want Maureen to serve me. She knows what I#m wanting.# I was that good with them. I#ve always had a brilliant rapport with them.#There have been a lot of change over the years, including managers and other things that I think should have just been kept the way they were, but you#ve got to move with the times you have to adapt.#We#re doing things like e-learning now which we never used to have to do. We#ve not been affected by the internet yet, but seemingly it#s coming. Some of the stores, such as the one on Reform Street, send their scripts away and get them back a couple of days later all packed up. So there are changes coming.#I don#t think there is a #hardest# part of my job. I#ve no worries when it comes to doing this role. I think it#s great you#re out-and-about, you#re your own boss.#It#s been a really good time for me, these last  years. I didn#t think I would last it myself, but I have. I don#t know why it came to be that I ended up in this job, but it#s a dream job. I#ve got another two-and-a-half years till I retire andI keep going like this, I#ll be absolutely fine!#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53418294-240x180.jpg

resolution to “call” the season has not yet been counted.As a result, with the plan having been passed by Premiership, League One and League Two Clubs, Dundee now hold the power to decide whether the League’s plan succeeds or fails.A vote in favour would see the season terminated in Scotland’s bottom three isions, prize money distributed, and Dundee United declared Championship title winners.A vote against will send the SPFL back to the drawing board.The Tangerines were tonight staying tight-lipped on the situation.However, their city rivals issued a y statement in which they notably failed to confirm which way they had voted –indeed they had at all – then called for an alternative approach.“As we all know, clubs are struggling at the moment,” read the Dark Blues’ communique.“The language in the currentproposal condemns clubs to be financially worse off than they already are as we sit here today. This has been dficult to accept.“The SPFL board and executive freely admit that they focused on the sporting merit of the proposal and did not take into consideration any financial fall out to their member clubs.“Fundamentally, we believe that in these exceptional and uncertain times, no member club should be worse off as a result of this proposal than they are today.“The current proposal will see member clubs cumulatively have in the region of £.-£ million pounds of lost revenue.“Amongst the member clubs there have been numerous discussions of the SPFL’s offer as well as viable, equitable proposed alternatives that could see, potentially, a neutral outcome for all clubs involvedthe season cannot be finished.“In all cases, current placement monies could be distributed to the member clubs in very short order while maintaining all SPFL obligations.“Make no mistake we would have to work quickly and diligently to ensure that members’ current needs are met and that the democratic process is followed, but it is achievable.”An SPFL spokesperson added: “It is very important that clubs consider carefully the resolution and we are grateful to those clubs who have voted already.“With the Ladbrokes Premiership and Ladbrokes Leagues One and Two isions each having approved the resolution, we await the voting slip from the one Ladbrokes Championship club that has yet to vote.“We will provide an update as soon as we are in a position to do so.”The SPFL set an initial deadline of pm for clubs to vote.However it is understood league rules give members  days to vote on resolutions – and Dundee are keen to weigh up their options.It is believed Partick Thistle and Inverness Caley Thistle were the two Championship sides to vote against the plan.As a result, Dundee appear to be in a position to set whichever agenda they please in negotiations with the SPFL.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

There are a few families around the area as well as people visiting, and this gives them another space to visit.“A lot of the time it is dficult for them to go to woodlands or gardens, so for them to have the chance to do that is great. The garden is designed specically so wheelchairs can go in and can get round the sensory beds. vw, px\"  “The beds will be there to provide dferent types of scent, taste and texture.“It is a hectic modern world. Since I started my work volunteering, it’s been very therapeutic to me, and I hope it will be the same for other people who are in stressful situations.“To be able to do that for people in our village is wonderful.”Plans for a garden have been in place for many years after the land was set aside for community use in the s.Trees were purchased in the early s and were planted by members of the community, including pupils from Balmedie School, who named the site Magnicent Seven woods.In , the woods were handed over to Belhelvie Community Trust so the garden could be created.Since then, volunteers have been working on the garden – and it was due to be opened in June.Some finishing touches are still to be made and a social media appeal has been launched to encourage members of the community to come forward to help get the project over the line. vw, px\"  A post on the garden’s social media profiles reads: “Balmedie has been and continues to be a place iniduals, businesses, families and voluntary groups, neighbours and friends call home.“Knowing that our garden has been a place for people to connect is incredible.“The sensory garden is still a work in progress.“I hope those of you who have shown our garden some love will continue to visit or maybe even lend a hand.”Joni said: “Before lockdown, we were doing a weekly meet, which was open to everyone. It’s a good way for people to get involved and feel part of it.“There’s some nice history there, particularly with the primary school children who planted the woods in the s.“It really is a case of finishing what they started.“We absolutely can’t wait to open.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports.

The documentrsquos most famous excerpt is a statement of Scottish independence.Mr Clark, who works at Hawick High School, has previously completed Scots translations of a number of popular books.The focus of his latest effort, however, was rather dferent in style to previous inspirations, which include Diary of a Wimpy Kid.It took Mr Clark and Ms Douglas around three months to convert the Declaration into our native language.Asked where his interest in Scots came from, Mr Clark said it was his move to the Borders  years ago which kick-started his love affair.ldquoI spoke Scots in Hamilton and so did my friends but I was under the impression it was just bad English ndash it was knocked out of you, said Mr Clark.ldquoBut then I came to the Borders and found that a lot of people not only spoke Scots, but spoke it without a social stigma.Reflecting on the Declaration, Mr Clark believes Scots have a strange relationship with the document.ldquoItrsquos funny that we have this text thatrsquos basically the birth certicate of the whole country, but therersquos not a lot of knowledge about it, said Mr Clark, going on to outline his views on its signicance.ldquoAt root, itrsquos a revolutionary document. Itrsquos a country asserting its right to be a country and its right to choose its own ruler.ldquoWe should be a lot more proud about Scotland being one of the first countries to assert itself in this way.Mr Clark says he supports Scottish independence, but he is keen for the Declaration to appeal to nationalists and unionists alike.He said: ldquoI think itrsquos really important the Declaration of Arbroath is not part of a political wrangle.

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"online-karate-classes-helping-keep-east-lothian-residents-fit-lockdown","story":"Chris Ewing usually hosts more than  karate classes each week throughout East Lothian, Midlothian and Edinburgh.But with schools and sports centres closing their doors, the karate teacher has moved things online.The man behind Chris Ewing Karateis offering one-month free virtual karate fitness classes in a bid to bring the community together.Mr Ewing, who is based in Tranent, said: ldquoWhen the schools and sports centres closed, I was trying to think of a way how I could keep the classes going and keep members going.ldquoWe have got a lot of members who are national team fighters and some are ranked in the top five in the world.ldquoI was looking online and a friend, Melissa Hand, saw an app called Zoom.

This is likely to have a negative impact on the health of constituents through pollution, as well as presenting a strain on the road infrastructure.ldquoI received a large amount of correspondence from constituents who were concerned about the opening of a McDonaldrsquos in Musselburgh and I wrote to East Lothian Council to outline these concerns, as well as to outline my own thoughts. I have asked the council to carefully consider the comments from the community, as the opinions of the local residents are of the utmost importance. It is highly important that the council listen to what the community want as they are the ones who will be affected by this decision.Mr MacAskill added: ldquoIrsquom aware of the considerable concerns in the community.ldquoThis seem entirely inappropriate given existing traffic congestion, current fast food provision and the likelihood of increased litter.ldquoIt may be becoming the norm where for large retailers to use their car parks as additional earners with drive thru facilities but this would cost the community dear.Opponents have started a petition in protest at plans for a restaurant in the Tesco car park, highlighting a range of concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The online petition lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo, spearheaded by local environment group Love Musselburgh C.I.C, currently has more than , signatures.If approved, the drive-thru would be built at the northern end of the car park at Tesco, near to the supermarketrsquos petrol station.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson previously said: ldquoWe have submitted a planning application for a new restaurant in Musselburgh which,approved, will create at least  new jobs for people in the local community.ldquoWe are working closely with the local authority to ensure our proposals are acceptable and address any concerns raised during the consultation process.According to documents lodged with the application, there would be seating for  visitors ldquowithin a relaxed, modern environment.Outside there would be  car parking spaces, including two disabled spaces, as well as space for bicycles.A supporting statement from McDonaldrsquos added: ldquoAfter a review of their property portfolio, Tesco have found that some parts of the existing car parks were underused and surplus to their requirements. There is consequently an opportunity to introduce a complementary use that would support the overall retailand enhance the range of facilities available to customers.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoThe application is currently pending consideration and will be reported in due course once the planning authority has completed its assessment of the proposed development.The petition can be viewed at change.org p east-lothian-council-no-mcdonald-s-in-musselburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"work-restore-east-beach-halted-coronavirus","story":"A bid to bring sand back to the beach and protect the nearby Lamer Street got under way at the beginning of last month.However, that work has been put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council told the Courier: ldquoFollowing the advice from Scottish Government to shut down non-essential construction sites, East Lothian Council took the decision that the Dunbar East Beach construction site should be temporarily closed until further notice.ldquoThe contractor made safe the site before leaving on Tuesday, March .The beach was previously a magnet for tourists due to its golden sands but the disappearance of the sand due to coastal erosion meant a drop in the number of visitors.Sand started to naturallyto the beach, which had become increasingly rocky, last autumn.The council has been weighing up what to do to tackle the problem for a number of years.Permission was given earlier this year to see work carried out, with hopes it would be complete by the summer, which may no longer be the case.The first phase of works would have seen the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of the beach, with the existing groyne refurbished.Further work would have seen rock armour put in place at the toe of the seawall.Temporary Traffic Regulation Ordershad been put in place to allow the movement of large vehicles through the town centre to the beach.Consideration had also been given to importing sand but that was ruled out.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the town on East Lothian Council, is the local authorityrsquos spokesman for the environment.He had stressed there were no guarantees that the work wouldthe beach to its former glory as it was down to nature.But he added: ldquoThe people we have taken advice from are some of the top consultants in marine engineering in the country."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-take-lead-find-dogs","story":"The sight of all those beautul dogs often encourages people to consider a dog for themselves. There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She looked up and saw smoke, then noticed all the animals running from a fire that had broken out amidst the heather.The squirrel rushed down the tree and also began to run.But she did not run out the forest like the other animals, instead she stopped at a river. She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water. The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water. As before, the flames fizzed for a moment but it made no dference.Just then a hare ran by and saw what the squirrel was doing.ldquoYou foolish animal, said the hare, ldquoyou canrsquot put the fire out by yourself.The squirrel looked at the hare and nodded.ldquoI know she said, ldquobut the forest is my home so Irsquom doing what I can do.Then she asked the hare, ldquoWill you help me The hare thought for a moment. He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears. You could use them.The hare stroked his ears.ldquoSo I do he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so the squirrel and hare ran to the river.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, collecting as much water as possible.They both ed to the fire, and stood a safe distance away. The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option.

The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears and the wild cat shook her whole body.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made little dference.Just then, a golden eagle was flying above and saw the squirrel, hare and wild cat.ldquoWell thatrsquos something Irsquove never seen before, said the golden eagle to herself, ldquoa squirrel, a hare and a wild cat working together. I have to find out whatrsquos going on.So the golden eagle flew down and watched what they were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the golden eagle, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the three of you.The wild cat looked at the golden eagle and nodded.ldquoWe know she said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the golden eagle and asked him, ldquoWill you help us The eagle had wide wings, and although he lived in the forest he could easily fly away and find another forest.But this was his home too no other forest had the memories this one had.ldquoI would like to help, said the golden eagle, ldquobut the thing is I have no bushy tail, no long ears nor a coat of fur.ldquoHmm, thatrsquos true, said the wild cat, but you do have many feathers.The eagle thought for a moment.ldquoSo I do, he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so this time the squirrel, the hare and the wild cat ran to the river, while the golden eagle flew above.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, while the wild cat took a deep breath and bravely jumped in and quickly out of the water soaking her coat.Then the golden eagle swooped down and collected water in his feathers.They ed to the fire, and all four stood a safe distance away.The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears and the wild cat shook her whole body, while the golden eagle ruffled his feathers above the flames.They all sprayed the fire with droplets of water at the same time, and the flames fizzed for a moment.This time it made a little dference.The other animals of the forest, who were running away from the fire, suddenly stopped and stared at the squirrel, at the hare, at the wild cat and at the golden eagle.ldquoYou foolish animals, they all said, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the four of you.The golden eagle looked at the other animals and nodded.ldquoWe know, he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us and has our memories, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at all the other animals, and asked them, ldquoWill you help us The fox looked at the deer, the deer looked at the pine marten, the pine marten looked at the capercaillie, the capercaillie looked at the buzzard all the animals and birds of the forest looked at each other and had a think.The forest was important to them all in dferent ways.ldquoVery well, they all said ldquowe will do what we can do.And so they did.

We all have habits that we perform every single day, we make cups of tea, we brush our teeth, we have a glass of water. What I want to show you is a way we can take advantage of these current habits, to make new habits. So, letrsquos take my example of drinking tea.While Irsquom waiting for my tea to brew, I can practice doing push ups. Over time doing push-ups will become a new habit attached on to my old habit of making tea.PracticeThe next point is, I would like you to think of these exercises as practice not training. In training itrsquos easy to get bogged down by sets and reps but these are not important for practice. In practice, we arenrsquot concentrating on how many reps we can do but rather on the movement itself.Practice is as much about increasing our own body awareness as it is about performing the exercise. Try and do these exercises slowly and with focus. Ask yourself questions like, where am I generating tension in my body now If yoursquore struggling to focus as the exercise is too easy or too hard, each video will show you some iations that you may find easier or harder.FormThe last point I want to talk about is Form.No-onersquos form is perfect when theyrsquore starting out with a new exercise. We all find it dficult doing something new, so donrsquot beat yourself up about it and more importantly donrsquot give up in frustration.Dficulty gives an opportunity to improve.In each of the videorsquos wersquoll give you some pointers to help improve your form. We need feedback in order to make adjustments to improve this form. We can do this using body awareness like I mentioned earlier but it can also be useful to video ourselves doing these exercises, to seewe can spot any issues.So there you have it, three things to keep in mind when doing these exercises:Use old habits to create new habits these exercises are an opportunity to practice movement form takes time and practice to develop.* Shops across Scotland are closing.

The internet means access to sophisticated online archives is only a mouse click away and there are scores of websites offering advice to those hoping to discover their inner Sherlock Holmes.It all makes genealogy ndash and historical research more generally ndash ideal for locked-down Scots seeking mental stimulation at home.The premises of institutions such as the National Library and National Records of Scotland might be shut but thatrsquos no barrier when information can be obtained instantly and from anywhere. Even more importantly, much of it is free.Researching your family treeThere has over the last two decades been an explosion in the range and richness of online content available to those looking to find out more about their ancestors. Public interest in family history has grown just as rapidly.The ScotlandsPeople Centre in Edinburgh , part of the National Records of Scotland, provides online access to births, marriages and deaths, as well as wills, census documents, Coats of Arms and valuation rolls.Fees are charged for viewing some items but, explains Iain Ferguson, Centre Manager, the entire operation has been designed to maximise speed and ease of use.ldquoInstead of the olden days when you had to come in, we now have digitised museum records, he says. ldquoYou just type in a name and year, and the system can search for it in an instant. And you have the opportunity to look up images of records.Of course, the online quest to trace a family tree doesnrsquot have to be limited to big national organisations.Independent websites can also offer a vital helping hand. FindMyPast , one of the largest and best known, gives armchair genealogists access to billions of records and its archive is expanding all the time. Late last year, it announced a new online collection spanning nearly five centuries of Dundee and Angus history. The materials provide names, dates, residences and occupations, as well as photographic documents of streets and people. Many are full colour scans from paper originals.Technology and a certain BBC TV show, says Mr Ferguson, have combined to turbo-charge the popularity of genealogy as a hobby ndash and therersquos no sign of a slowdown.ldquoI would say there has been growth in the number of people being interested in family history, certainly, particularly around ten years ago, when Who Do You Think You Are was on television, he adds.ldquoAnd, as time has progressed, more and more records have been put up by family history societies and so on. People are far more keen. They have a thirst for knowledge.Itrsquos good to talkWhile technology undoubtedly supports the task of discovering an ancestor or their involvement in a major historical event, theres no substitute for conversation with family when it comes to unearthing the most exciting clues.Grandparents, aunts, uncles and, of course, mum and dad should all be among the first ports of call. Even older siblings and cousins can helpelderly relatives have passed away. And video chat apps mean the coronavirus lockdown is no obstacle to enjoying quality, face-to-face contact.ldquoTalking to your family is hugely important, says Tahitia McCabe, Genealogical Studies Postgraduate Programme Course Director at the University of Strathclyde.ldquoItrsquos the way you get the juicy bits - the stories and all the interesting stuff. Genealogy is about bringing history, people and places to le.ldquoThe official records donrsquot tell you the lsquowhyrsquo. They can only really capture the interface with governments and organisations, all the formal things that happen in your le. But there are lots of things that happen that donrsquot get captured in a formal way.Moving the focus of genealogy beyond official records and on to real human relationships is crucial to its wider appeal, says Ms McCabe, adding that the number of people under  attending her courses is definitely ldquocreeping up.The broader pictureAn accurate record of inidual events is vital but so is context - and few institutions are better equipped to provide this than the National Library of Scotland .Its huge multi-media archiveis a gold mine for digital genealogists and historians of all ages, particularly those seeking information about ancestors caught up in the two world wars.Lists of officers enrolled in the army, navy and air force, and an extensive collection of black-and-white photographs from the Western Front, are available free of charge. Also on offer are clan histories, maps and a moving image archive containing footage from communities across the country. Lucy Church, NLS reference services assistant, says such resources are vital for adding a social dimension to the raw information set out in documents such as birth, marriage and death certicates.ldquoPeople use [our collection] to find out about specic iniduals but what itrsquos best for is the bigger picture ndash social and local history, for example, she adds.ldquoWhat we have available has vastly increased in recent years. Since the internet has been available, the archiving world has really engaged with it - and how we can provide a service through it.Stressing that staff are always on hand to assist home users in dficulty, she says: ldquoIf you think of institutions like ourselves, the National Museum of Scotland, National Records ndash they all have really excellent websites. The best way [for people] to familiarise themselves with the collection is to have a look and just be guided by what their particular interest is.Parents in particular will find Scotlandrsquos major cultural institutions invaluable when theyre trying to keep children busy. The NLS website features a wide-ranging learning zone with materials about topics such as the womenrsquos suffrage movement.The Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust, meanwhile, has created dedicated online resourceswhich its leaders hope will inspire youngsters to create prose, poetry and art about Bonnie Prince Charliersquos famous victory in  over a government army led by Sir John Cope. Entries will be published online and organisers hope to include as many as possible in a special commemorative book to mark the battlersquos th anniversary.Also offering online home schooling assistance is the National Wallace Monument, which has launched a video series to help young people learn about William Wallace and the Wars of Scottish Independence. Available at www.nationalwallacemonument, it is aimed at children aged between  and  who are encouraged to watch the videos and answer questions based on the content.Catherine Morrison, Learning and Volunteer Co-ordinator at Stirling District Tourism, says: ldquoUsually, Irsquom hosting trips for school children at the Monument, or visiting schools to teach them all about William Wallace. These are things wersquore not currently able to do, but we wanted to do something to support parents and keep their children learning about history.Sidebar ndash top tips for the budding genealogist Start with what you know. Begin by writing down everything you know about your family ndash names, dates of birth, places of residence. Evenall you have are rough dates and more questions than answers, itrsquos a place to launch your project. Talk to your family ndash do this sooner rather than later. If elderly relatives have all passed away, try older siblings or cousins. Search official records. Generally, yoursquoll want to try and obtain birth, marriage and death information for your ancestors and anyone  on your tree that is of interest. Plus, finding them on available census records is of primary importance. Itrsquos best to start as close to the present as possible and work your way back. That way you can usually very facts with your memories and records, or by checking with other family members. Once you have built up your skills, keep going! You could get involved in new projects such as a transcription or indexing project in your spare time. This is a great way to expand skills in deciphering old handwriting.

Simple language, delivered calmly and directly, has the best chance of sinking in.Honesty, clarity, calmness and directness have never been more vital than now, as we try to take in the enormity of the coronavirus crisis and its consequences. And yet many of our leaders are showing themselves to be woefully, shamefully, sometimes even deliberately incapable of giving straight answers to some of the most fundamental questions.The public accepts that scientists and medics do not yet understand every facet and quirk of this virus. But there is simply no excuse for the disgraceful lack of honestly and clarity around many issues that politicians can control.If ever there was a time for politicians be direct with people, this is it. We do not want obsequiousness, we do not need the pill to be sugar-coated. Donrsquot patronise or insult us. Just tell it like it is, even when itrsquos bad. Especially when itsbad.

After all, there is still no reliable death toll, no UK or Scottish stats that include care home and community deaths as well as those that took place in hospital. Grieving relatives are left to tell their stories on social media, devastated that their loved-onersquos death doesnrsquot seem to count, distressed at the lack of knowledge or discussion around care home guidelines.There is still no honest or plausible explanation for why so few coronavirus tests are taking place, or why tracing ndash which has helped Germany and South Korea keep deaths down ndash was abandoned so early on. It cannot be unrelated that no minister or official dares to explain why the death toll in the UK is on course to surpass that of Italy and Spain, despite having had more time to prepare. People in England are dying of Covid- at . times the rate of Ireland, which has a comparable number of ICU beds per head of population.Theses and explanations already exist, of course, but are not judged by politicians to be politically expedient or comfortable.

This chastising tone is an insult to us all, not least the dead and bereaved.Indeed, the defensive insults are starting to stack up. Over the weekend Ms Patelrsquos cabinet colleague Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, made the contemptuous suggestion that the continuing shortage of personal protective equipment at the frontline could be down to doctors and nurses over-using it.And while some sections of the media choose to focus unhealthy amounts of attention on one particularly well-known Covid- patient, offering a running commentary on his recovery complete with sudoku, texts from his girlfriend and the films he is watching from his hospital bed, it is left to others to highlight the far bigger tragedies already emerging from this crisis.As Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis pointed out in a blistering attack on the patronising and ldquomisleading language being used by some ministers during the crisis, we are not all in this together.

Not just a war with a virus, wersquore also entering into a class war.This virus is highlighting the massive disparities in our economic systems. And we are reminded that Covid- was spread internationally by the easy-travelling, ski-resort wealthy, in Europe and the US. Whatrsquos become obvious in the past two weeks is that our opinions of others, particularly the rich, famous and powerful, will be framed by their behaviour in this new war against a pandemic.Whatrsquos clear is thatthose with cash continue to behave in a crass, disconnected manner, they will become history.Ricky Gervais reflected public opinion yesterday when he complained of the celebrities who live in large mansions and whine about isolation.Gervais believes healthcare workers, such as nurses and porters, should be given more recognition then added: ldquoI see someone complaining about being in a mansion with a swimming pool. And, you know, honestly, I just donrsquot want to hear it.Nor do most of us. The father in the Great War poster is being depicted as a man of shame because he decided not to enlist and fight for his country.The likes of singer Sam Smith who whine about being stuck in a multi-roomed mansion are examples of those who have yet to enlist with reality.The crassness of the utterly disconnected Madonna news reports of dying doctors and nurses and bus drivers ndash and still remain entirely self-absorbed Our top footballers, too, are facing a kicking. We have , people in Britain dead and it beggars belief that those who are being paid poundk a week refuse to take a pay cut.Yes, pundit Gary Lineker is right when he says: \"Why not call on all the wealthy to try and helpthey possibly can rather than just pick on footballers \"But why not have footballers lead by example, Gary  And how much of your poundm a year ndash plus crisp earnings ndash are you offering up to food banks Not all footballers face opprobrium, however. Heroes have emerged such as Newcastle United youngster Matty Longstaff who has given  per cent of his pound a week salary to the NHS.And Rangersrsquo so-called bad boy Alfredo Morelos, who is now working in Columbia delivering food parcels to the poor and giving up a sizeable amount of his earnings.But in the future, it will be hard not to see celebrities through their corona response. It will be hard not to think of the Beckhams ndash happy to post social media pics from their beautul Cotswold home ndash without thinking: \"What I really want to know is how much you are kicking in the direction of vaccine initiatives or PPE \"If itrsquos nothing, I will be angry for ever.The War Office was morally wrong in many ways: it demanded men be led to slaughter by those who placed a low value on human le. And fathers being dead means quizzical daughters have an altogether dferent set of questions to ask.But the poster was successful in asking broader questions, about togetherness, about shared responsibility.And the coronavirus is certainly making us ask who our heroes are right now, people we can look up to. There are some obvious ones: the health and care workers, those who work in the trenches of public service. At a political level therersquos the commanding, compassionate Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand and Andrew Cuomo in New York.Letrsquos hope the likes of Sam Smith and Gary Lineker and his mates will be able to hold their heads up when the kids start asking the questions.Shops across Scotland are closing.

However, it is important that the Scottish Government explains what consideration has been given to these proposals and the rationale for adopting a dferent approach.“I have therefore written to the Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman and First Minister asking for that clarication. I have also sought confirmation as to whether the Scientic Advisory Committee has been asked for its comments on Dr Pollock’s proposals. If not, I certainly hope that this will now happen.“As soon as I have received a response from Ms Freeman, I will share this widely with constituents. Now more than ever, it is essential that there is as much transparency as possible and that government is clear about the basis for the decisions it is taking”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If someone is threatened by cattle, they are encouraged to release your dog and take the shortest route out of the field. As always pick up and remove all waste. A government spokesman said: #This is a temporary situation and it is more important now than ever to maintain good relationships between neighbours and within communities. This is not about restricting the general right of responsible non-motorised access to land but it is part of the wider approach to prevent COVID- deaths and preserving the nation’s food supplies.#Exercising access rights responsibly means respecting the needs of other people, and you will need to adapt your behaviour accordingly in the national effort to contain the spread of COVID-.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in . I hope that recording will make its way into Tobar an Dualchais one day.I met Willie Matheson just the once long ago – Allan insisted I come with him to the hospital where Willie was in a wheelchair, frail but with bright eyes and a welcome smile. I was just at the very beginning of coming to an understanding of Gaelic culture, but there, with my hazy stumbling knowledge, I felt included.Such brief encounters can mean so much. – The Sufferings of Christ.

On Thursday it closed Dungannon Park and Ballyronan Marina to vehicle access.Meanwhile, Ards and North Down Borough Council has closed its larger parks open spaces such as Kiltonga Nature Reserve, as there were concerns around the ability to maintain social distancing.Island Hill was also shut after evidence emerged of visitors travelling to the site by car.Other parks in residential areas remain open as places for people to walk for exercise.All public parks and open spaces remain open in the Derry City and Strabane District Council and Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council areas.Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council has closed Megaw Park in Ballymoney, Dungiven Castle Park and Croaghan Way, but large recreational spaces remain open to facilitate public access routes.From Saturday vehicle access was denied at Downhill, Benone and Castlerock beaches after cars got stuck in the sand, causing avoidable callouts for the emergency services. Pedestrian access is still available for local residents and those who use the beaches for daily exercise or to walk their dogs.Councils that have kept their parks open have all encouraged those using them to adhere to the social distancing guidelines.Mr Poots said one view was that social distancing can be practised better in green spaces, rather than confining people to footpaths. That is not an unreasonable argument. However, we had a problem a number of weeks ago with large crowds of people congregating in forest parks, he explained.I personally don#t have an issue with anybody going out for a walk in a park but it was the issue of congregations that caused us the problems.If that isn#t an issue then people walking in a park shouldn#t be an issue because they#re getting exercise, it#s good for their mental health and getting a bit of fresh air is good for their general health, so long as they#re avoiding contact with other people.Highlighting the huge crowds that swelled Tollymore and Castlewellan Forest Parks in Co Down before their closures, Mr Poots said the number of people was clearly not within the Government#s guidelines.I would like to see the forest parks open as quickly as possible, but on the basis that people observe the rules and use them purely for walking, he added.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Other countries, including the UK, opted for a containment approach.A strict lockdown is in place, which prevents citizens from swimming in the ocean or hunting in bushland.Dr McElnay told thethat she attributed the country#s low case and death rates to its swt response.We haven#t seen the rapid escalation of cases seen in so many other countries because we went into lockdown earlier, before we had signicant numbers of cases, she said.Efforts have been helped by its remote location as well as air travel restrictions. Around , people who arrived in New Zealand after the lockdown were held in commandeered hotels and monitored until they are shown not to have the virus. A highly efficient contact tracing system is also helping.Dr McElnay said: Our advantage is that we are an island nation, so we can have strict border controls and that is really helpful.The public health expert relocated to New Zealand in  with her husband and is now a citizen with three children: Caitriona, Roisin and Connor.With over two decades of work in public health, she is no stranger to dealing with emergencies, but says no training can really prepare you for what it#s actually like tackling a pandemic.New Zealand will decide early next week what will happen after an initial four-week lockdown ends on April  - weeks before other countries will expect to follow suit.

PSNI advice states that people can leave home to exercise, for example, a run, walk or cycle - alone or with members of your household.

It is the assessment of the Police Service that it is also a breach of the restrictions.The spokesperson said that there was no reason for people to travel for exercise. Simply, the restrictions require you to have a reasonable excuse to have a need to leave home, it’s not just a reason, but a need and I see no need for anybody to drive miles in order to take their daily exercise so that would put you in breach of the restrictions, the spokesperson said.

So we don#t think a reduction in remuneration right now is feasible, but this should nevertheless be the ambition for all councils in the future.The group#s chief executive John O#Connell added: There are plenty of talented people in local authorities who are focused on delivering more for less, but that is needed across the board. The country needs every council to cut out waste and prioritise key services without resorting to punishing tax hikes on their residents.These figures should shine a light on the town hall bosses who#ve got it right, but also allow taxpayers to hold to account those who aren#t delivering value for money at this critical time. A Belfast City Council spokesperson said salaries for chief executives in Northern Ireland#s  councils were set independently as part of a robust and independent job evaluation exercise.They added Ms Wylie#s salary took account that Belfast is the largest local council, and was benchmarked against comparable posts in the public sector.Other considerations included an independent evaluation of job roles of directors in Belfast City Council, and attracting the necessary calibre of senior staff to City Hall.Pension contributions are set by the Northern Ireland Local Government Officers# Superannuation Committee.Remuneration levels for all senior staff in Belfast City Council are published annually. The spokesperson added that the council and senior management team was focused on delivering essential public services and supporting residents during the coronavirus pandemic.This includes a new virtual community hub, including a dedicated helplineto help coordinate delivery of food parcels, provide advice on jobs and benefits, practical assistance such as collecting prescriptions, and offering emotional supportneeded.Belfast Most ReadQuarter of restaurants may never re-open after lockdown – hospitality bossCoronavirus: Confusion over PSNI advice on travelling for exerciseFour people charged after car stolen in Belfast #creeper# burglaryMurder inquiry launched as family grieves for teenager John Paul McDonagh killed in Enniskillen stabbingDozens of care homes affected by coronavirus – health minister,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases.

This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms.

Deaglaacuten McCallion, from Bellaghy, decided against giving up anything for Lent his year and instead opted to donate the pocket money he would normally receive to a good cause. Last week the -year-old presented Hope Magherafelt Food Bank with a donation of pound, and his mum Louise explained why he chose the charity. “He wanted to give it to them because it was close and he wanted it to go to people in the community,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “With everything going on with the coronavirus, he said he wanted to give it to the food bank, because there would be children and families with no food.” The St John Bosco PS pupil received some of the money as pocket money for doing bits and pieces around the house, but he also donated some money gted to him for Easter. Louise said: “He gathered up pound himself and then my friend had given him pound for Easter. His granny and grandad gave him a tenner and then we added the extra fiver to bring it up to pound. “He’s very thoughtful and wants to help people, seeing things in that way. It’s lovely to see that because he is an only child and he’s always wanting to help people.” googletag.cmd.push Deaglaacuten’s parents are understandably proud of their son and are hoping that this small act of kindness can make a big dference to the local community. “We are so proud of him,” said Louise. “He just wants to help and put money towards things. He’s always talked about how he would love to give homes to the homeless and things like that. He’s a very happy-go-lucky child. He takes everything in his stride, just like his daddy! We’re glad that he sees things in le this way and hope he keeps going with that.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He praised them for their efforts at engaging with the younger players via videos to keep them engaged, motivated and help them practice their skills in the absence of group training. He praised the GAA as an organisation for their swt action within hours of Taoiseach Leo Varadkars decision to begin the lock-down on Thursday, March . “I just think, at times, the GAA hasnt got the credit it deserves,” he concluded. “This time their decision to close down was the correct one and they deserve recognition for it.” - RELATED Claudy teachers lead by example during sporting lock-down.

Its the time when things start to become very real, yet its a Hadrians Wall we all have to get over. The worry about what happens when the small talk runs out, only to be replaced with an uncomfortable silence. I didnt have that problem. Minutes into my visit, I was on the pigs back. One of the things I remember – apart from the never-ending flow of tea – was Paulines mother Bridie talking about school days in St Patricks Maghera, where she worked for  years. googletag.cmd.push The other was her father Patsy having the same fanaticism with talking football as I did. Hours later, a thousand balls were kicked, championships were won and lost, an th cup of tea was thrust in my direction before I headed for home. With the current social distancing, we are now talking in the window , yet little has changed. Before the more stringent lock-down, you were offered tea as soon as you land on the street with some of the weeks essentials and the chat has changed towards sporting nostalgia. “Mickey might make use of these,” Bridie said to Pauline on a visit, before the the lock-down. Yes that Mickey is me, but thats another story. googletag.cmd.push It was another stash of Maghera school magazines, The Patrician, going back to the early s. And low and behold, as I searched frantically for a photo of Niall Mullan to go with this weeks feature on Derry hurlings glory days, there he was in full flow in the  Patrician. TIME FOR CHANGE Like every media outlet, producing the County Derry Posts sport section has taken a change of direction. It involves more delving and conjuring. Gone are the reports and round-ups from the club league. The athletics, soccer and rugby seasons are on hold. The local cycling clubs have came to a halt. Now it is all about nostalgia. In these testing times, it gives our readers a chance to reflect on the past. We are living in unprecedented times. It takes a bit of readjusting, but sports writers are the lucky ones. We have a mountain of material out there – just begging to be sourced. There are stories waiting to be told. When researching Colum Rocks impact on Loups underage success of the early s, his nephew Ronan handed me a bag of scrapbooks. It was simply unbelievable. I am not from Loup, but it was compelling reading. Newspaper cuttings of match reports, previews and pen-pics. There was even a summary of each season and hopes of the next. I was relieved to leave them back. If I had lost them....lets just say, you couldnt replace them. For the Bellaghy piece a few weeks ago, Joe Cassidy was able to head to his father and mothers house in Ballynease and dig through the memories. If the walls could talk, they would tell the entire Bellaghy story, as well as the Derry pathway of their sons Joe and Damian. In an interview with teenager Enda Downey, before the postponed MacRory final, he mentioned his Granda and Granny Downeys collection of artefacts, including videos of games and how it gave him a taste of generations past, before he was even born. “We watched onethe other day and it was just catch and kick, it was so dferent to now,” he said of one of the s of videos, all stored away. The media industry has moved on. The newer generation is more au fait with online and getting their fix from social media. Thats the challenge we face, finding that balance. But, the last few weeks have reinforced one thing – there is no substitute for the hard copy. YouTube channels come and go, websites can vanish and hard drives can crash. On the other hand, a well archived set of papers, programmes and magazines is simply invaluable. As the pandemic continues, any glimmer of a date for the resumption of sport is far away over the horizon. When it arrives, we will embrace it like never before. My first visit to Patsy and Bridie Kennedy taught me well. Get the kettle boiled as soon as you can and lt the lid on all the great moments from the past. We need conversation, positivity and nostalgia more than ever. RELATED - Sideline Views Derry team with a dference. Click here...

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion. Mickey Collins won a free which his brother Ollie drove between the posts at the Andersonstown Road end. Derry fans among the , strong Casement Park attendance exploded into another frenzy, as their caman-wielding heroes hit the front again. googletag.cmd.push Was this eventually going to be their day  Not just yet. There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally. The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

Twenty years ago this year, Derry pushed Offaly every step of the way and won the respect of a nation. The former Oak Leaf defender spoke to Michael McMullan….  Its your job to enhance the legacy so when you finish playing you have tothe jersey to a better place than what you got it in. - Dan Carter Dan Carters words are both romantic and sincere, painting a picture of a career that ended with the Webb Ellis Cup in his clutches. googletag.cmd.push Not everybody gets the perfect send off. Some stay too long and others dont achieve, both leaving a sense of regret. Niall Mullan is one of the lucky ones. The Kevin Lynchs man, from a family steeped in hurling, saw his -year senior career with Derry come to a conclusion under the spine-tingling, rapturous applause of a standing ovation at Croke Park. The Oakleafers, after winning Ulster for the first time in  years, pushed Offaly to the brink. The electrying realisation that – barring Offalys fans – the entire stadium was willing them on, allowed Derry to play with real purpose. googletag.cmd.push But it was Offaly who found enough to win the game. Boy did they earn it. They did benefit from Ollie Collins Achilles injury after  minutes. It was a huge loss to Derry who, in the final analysis, had no answer to Johnny Dooley. The Seir Kieran man had his snipers vision finely tuned and contributed  points. It was enough for the  champions. Niall Mullans final chapter in the red and white of Derry came in the most gallant of defeats. The rest of Ireland were forced to stand up and take notice. One of his opponents that day certainly did. Joe Dooley entered the fray after  minutes. Seconds later a sliotar flashed across his path. Goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson was always grateful for the positional sense of his defence. “They always seemed to know where the ball would land,” he said of Mullan, Collie McGurk and Conor Murray in front of him. For once, Mullan admits to having lost his bearings and Joe Dooley got a right introduction. “I took a wild swing rather than trying to catch it,” Mullan recalls. Without taking control of the ball he, lashed on it and his hurl broke across Dooley. It was all part of the battle for supremacy. No quarter was asked and none was given, with the duo swapping jerseys at the final whistle. The competitive respect we all drool over. As Mullan said farewell to inter-county hurling, he walked down the dressing room tunnel with Dooleys jersey in his grasp. “Its still my pride and joy,” he said. *** Sport was never going to be far away from Niall Mullans le. His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers. At the time of our interview, Mullan is unsure. For someone who has achieved so much, the silverware is over-rated. “I dont know, I am not joking,” came Mullans response to how many county titles he had amassed. “I got a thing for my thbirthday from one of my brothers. My medals are up on the wall, but I wouldnt even count them.” Mullan holds the memories closer to his heart. “The people who were foes then, that are good friends now. The likes of Declan Cassidy and Collie McGurk. There was Conor Murray too, who was playing on the Derry hurling team from the start.” Thats what he takes from it. Since making his debut when he was  or , Mullan was pretty much an ever-present in Derrys defence until calling it a day at the age of . “I think there was one of the years, I didnt go to the hurling as I was in the football . Hinpheystropped speaking to me because of it,” he laughs. Hinphey arrived in Dungiven from Kilkenny, along with the input of Laveys Tom Magill, left an unquantiable imprint on the hurling landscape of the county. With the big ball, Mullan won two MacRory Cups with St Patricks Maghera and was on Derrys All-Ireland minor winning team of . He played U football for the county and was on the  for the  senior final defeat by Monaghan, but missed out on the Ulster title in . In hurling, under the guidance of Joe McGurk, he was midfield on the first team from the school to land the Mageean Cup, .  Niall Mullan in action against St Louis Ballymena in the  Mageean Cup final “An experienced hurler, Nialls calmness and nerve rubbed off on the other players of lesser experience,” read an extract from the  school magazine, the Patrician. “His long-range pointing was an invaluable asset to the team.” The team was captained by McGurks brother Johnny and included future All-Ireland senior football winners Henry and Seamus Downey, who was the teams goalkeeper. Enda Gormley and Damian Cassidy, not from hurling clubs were on the team. Cassidy was the competitions top scorer and bagged - in the final against St Louis Ballymena at Bellaghy. For Mullan, the experienced hurler, he was only starting. *** It all began miles away from  and what it represented. Derry hurling had made a habit of languishing in Division Three, when Mullan joined during the mid-s. He is the only player to have played in all four isions of the league. He recalls how they would always lose as many games as they won. But it began to gradually change. Block by block, the building process began. In , after winning the All-Ireland B championship, Derry went to play New York in Gaelic Park. It was the era of Hugo McOscar and Pat Joe McKennas management. After arriving a day late and having to play in a searing  degrees heat in a dust bowl, they got slaughtered in the game, Mullan remembers. “After that, we had four or five days as a get together, as a team, and we enjoyed ourselves. On the flight home, I remember Declan Cassidy and a few of us talking,” he added. “We had grown close as a group, we knew the hurlers were there. We were talking that we could do a wee bit with this group.” The following year, Derry won promotion to Division Two and went on to contest the  and  Ulster senior finals. Mullan remembers ex-Down manager Sean McGuinness telling them how close they were getting. To make the final push they would need to be playing top level hurling in the league. A win over Wicklow, in Portlaoise, saw Derry promoted to Division One as champions. “Before we went into theUlster championship, we played Kerry in a play-off match in Parnell Park and we beat them well to stay up,” Mullan recalls of their first season dining with the big boys. “It gave us a lot of confidence. We played well that day andwe had played like that in some of the other games, we couldve beaten one of the bigger teams. “I remember playing Wexford, up in Slaughtneil, and it was a dirty, wet day. We held them for a long time and they pulled away in the second half with the wind.” A lot had a changed since theirfrom New York. Collie McGurk had committed solely to hurling and Kieran McKeeversto the hurling  in , rubber-stamped its attraction. Before that, players just came and went. There was no continuity. Now it was dferent. “You ask the likes of Co McEldowney, or anyone playing at that time, it was really enjoyable to play and we had plenty of craic on the way home on the bus. You could just see everybody that was there...wanted to be there.” Away from the fun, there was also an appetite for work. Manager Kevin McNaughton had enlisted fitness coach Malcolm McCausland. No longer was it running laps til you boked. “He would take us up to do sprints and he gave us a programme of what to do ourselves,” Mullan points out. Going into the Ulster final, Derry were perfectly poised. They had ran Antrim to three points two years previously, had a strong league campaign under their belt and were convincing semi-final winners over Down. Their win over Antrim in the final was all the more notable, with the absence of Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever due to suspension. “Emmett was captain and he never missed a night of training right through and he never got his suspension lted...he just drove the thing on another notch. “Kevin was the manager, but Tomdid a lot of the training,” Mullan reveals. With an Ulster title in the bag, the duo ramped up the preparations even more. “Training wouldve involved a lot of shorter games...they had everything speeded up and closed in. The training matches were faster, there was no time - you just got the ball and got it away. “I remember that everybodys hurling was good at that time and you got used to the speed the big boys played at, thats what they concentrated on.” It was time to take their hurling to the biggest stage of all. *** Adrian Logan was deployed to Derry to get a taste of the new hurling revolution and arrived at Younger Homes in Maghera. It was the week of the new Ulster champions baptism against All-Ireland contenders Offaly in the Croker cauldron and Niall Mullan was the interviewee. “I remember telling him that theyknew absolutely nothing about us and we knew who they were. I thought that was an advantage and we were going to throw the kitchen sink at them.” Derry travelled south the day before the game and stayed out of Dublin. Everything was relaxed. During the week, the squad were flying at training. The scene was set. Sitting in the dressing room, Niall Mullan was conscious it could be his last game with the famous Oakleaf badge on his chest. “Collie McGurk was , Conor Murray was  and I was ,” Mullan now jokes. “So thats over  combined years, so there were no speed merchants.” As the team togged out, Mullan noticed the usual nerves werent present. He was taking it all in his stride. “I was walking about...thinking Ill beoff after  minutes or I will play well. Thats just how I felt.” “Collie would always talk in the changing room and he was telling us lets get wired into these b******s, there would always be some of the players chipping in.” From the win over Antrim, the management had some reshuffling to do. Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers.

Sitting in the dressing room, Niall Mullan was conscious it could be his last game with the famous Oakleaf badge on his chest. “Collie McGurk was , Conor Murray was  and I was ,” Mullan now jokes. “So thats over  combined years, so there were no speed merchants.” As the team togged out, Mullan noticed the usual nerves werent present. He was taking it all in his stride. “I was walking about...thinking Ill beoff after  minutes or I will play well. Thats just how I felt.” “Collie would always talk in the changing room and he was telling us lets get wired into these b******s, there would always be some of the players chipping in.” From the win over Antrim, the management had some reshuffling to do. Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

I went off to my daughter’s school and got everything sorted out and then came out home. “I thought we’d all go to the beach a run and walk the dogs to get away from the chaos for an hour, but I wasn’t in the house ten minutes until the police landed.” Maggie immediately realised her mistake when the police officers appeared, and they accompanied her back to Tesco so she could pay her bill. googletag.cmd.push However, once she had paid the outstanding amount at the Customer Service Desk, she was waved over by the store’s security guard.

Bishop McKeown visited the cemetery at dawn to sprinkle graves using Easter Water that was blessed in St Eugene’s Cathedral during the Easter Vigil Mass on Saturday night. The visit was arranged in co-operation with Derry City and Strabane District Council. Bishop McKeown said he hoped the Easter Blessing would bring some comfort to grieving families across the Derry Diocese who are unable to visit the graves of their loved ones. He said he was very aware that the government legislation that forced all cemeteries and burial grounds to close for visitors, was a dficult one for many people, but he urged the public to be mindful of their own health and welfare and to take heed of the government advice to Stay at Home. googletag.cmd.push He urged people to have faith and to remember their loved ones through prayer and reflection and encouraged the public to care for one another during this dficult time. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more. RIP Roly.Roly Hanna -.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Cormac.jpg","title":"Ardglass golfer on teeing up with the best in the world  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin could be forgiven for feeling understandably frustrated right now.The richly talented  year-old should be locking horns with some of the worldrsquos best players on the European tour.But instead of prowling the fairways hersquos holed up in his apartment in Dublin mdash like many others undergoing coronavirus lockdown.Itrsquos not how Sharvin, currently th in golfrsquos world rankings, thought his first season on the European Tour would go.Having secured his card for the  season by finishing th on the  Challenge Tour rankings, he was gearing up for a potential breakthrough campaign on the top circuit.However, after just four events, he is unsure of what the future holds as the sporting world goes into shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.He clearly appreciated that golf, and sport in general, is of minor importance when compared with the COVID pandemic.Of the decision to close all golf courses north and south of the border, he told the BBC recently: ldquoItrsquos a precaution that needs to be in place.I donrsquot know enough about the virus, but theyrsquore obviously trying to slow things down. Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see. It can get really emotional as there are now family members turning up to wave and talk to their relatives through windows while I sing.ldquoItrsquos heartfelt to see their enjoyment at being able to connect with their parents or grandparents inside. It can be heart-breaking at times but itrsquos still nice to see it.ldquoI have been told by some of the carers that they have seen some patients with dementia sing along to the music and thatrsquos also really good to know.A former soloist with St Patrickrsquos Church in Ballynahinch and ex-pupil of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College, Wayne ensures he keeps the residents and carers safe at all times.A long extension power lead from the home is laid for him before he arrives so he can plug in his mixing desk, microphone and laptop.Wayne said: ldquoItrsquos sterilised before I get it and when I had it back itrsquos sterilised again so I have no direct contact with anyone in the home.ldquoI try not to sing beyond  minutes as the homes often open the windows to allow residents to hear better and Irsquom conscious of not wanting anyone to get too cold in the process.Wayne started off singing at a Magherafelt nursing home when a pub owner hersquos friendly with was approached by the home asking for suggestions at how they could entertain the residents.He added: ldquoThe residents in the home loved it and asked me to come back again so I did and then I got calls from other homes.He now has nine performances under his belt with the help of his brother-in-law, former Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin, and his sister, Michelle, who runs Paddy Kellyrsquos Bar in Ballynahinch.Wayne, whose parents Maurice and Naveen still live in Ballynahinch, has been a show band singer for years and once performed with the legendary Sunshine.Gigs for his wedding band, The All Stars, have been cancelled or postponed as couples were force to rebook their wedding dates.Wayne is performing free of charge and says he is happy to as it gives him some focus in his le at this time.ldquoI donrsquot have much  to do as work has stopped, but I do feel a lot better knowing that Irsquom bringing some happiness to others, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Binmen.jpg","title":"Binmen receiving thank you messages for essential work  ","story":"THE districtrsquos binmen have been thanked for continuing to provide collection services during the coronavirus pandemic.Some people have been pasting messages on their bins thanking the men for the job they are doing, while their efforts have also been commended by Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Working in extremely dficult circumstances, the binmen are providing a critical service at this time and their efforts have not gone unnoticed by ratepayers who taking time to wipe the handles of their bins with disinfectant before they are collected to help keep refuse staff safe.Householders are also being reminded to ensure that they continue to place the correct waste in the right bin to help ease the burden on public health services to help stop additional risks to staff who are working under increasing pressure.Refuse collection staff have been singled out for particular praise as they collect and transport waste, with their work also helping to protect the environment.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots said the materials refuse staff collect for processing such as cardboard, plastic and glass are vital resources in package production across the food and retail sectors, explaining that ain recycling could impact on the supply chain ing effectively.He added: ldquoAll those working in the waste sector are key workers and I have also established a COVID- Waste Group to provide support, guidance and regulatory direction to the waste sector.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which recently closed all its household recycling centres to redeploy staff to work in refuse collection mdash said that all bin collections continue as normal.However, residents are asked to provide additional help by ensuring that bins are put out for collection no later than am every morning or the night before.Where possible, residents are asked not to restrict bin lorry access and park as considerately as possible. Over recent weeks, binmen have experienced issues accessing homes in a number of areas including Ballynahinch and Newcastle to collect bins.Residents are also asked to ensure that all bin handles are cleaned or wiped-down before and after use and not to approach refuse staff without following the minimum two-metre social distancing guidance.Commending refuse staff for the work they are doing in dficult circumstances, the council chairman explained that as the coronavirus crisis unfolded, the local authority was quick to implement a number of health and safety measures to protect staff.He explained that the measures allowed bin collection teams to continue the service with minimal disruptions to residents.ldquoCrews now operate staggered start times between .am and am and are authorised to leave work immediately upon the completion of their rounds, said Cllr Casey.ldquoTo support social distancing, crews are restricted to one driver and one loader in each cab.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

He also highlighted the need for financial support for the southern relief road scheme in Newry.ldquoI fully understand that the roads minister has a lot on her plate and recognise that she is not responsible for the failure of her department to invest in any major road scheme in the local area over the past number of decades, he continued. ldquoThe bypass should be in place by now. Itrsquos potential for Ballynahinch and the wider South Down economy is immense.ldquoThe multi-million pound road scheme can rid Ballynahinch of its traffic nightmare, help rejuvenate the town and encourage more visitors into the district and wider Mournes area.South Down MP Chris Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  when hewas roads minister in a previous Executive.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the by-pass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all. If you can, embrace the cotton wool,only for a while..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Workload.jpg","title":"Workload up for Good Morning Down staff  ","story":"THE Good Morning Down charity which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district has increased the number of calls it makes as the coronavirus takes hold.Volunteers who work for highly acclaimed charity mdash now in its th year mdash have relocated from the organisationrsquos base at the Down Business Park in Downpatrick to their homes to ensure that the friendly voices people have come to rely on continue to be heard.Good Morning Down has also confirmed that in addition to increasing the number of calls that it makes, it has moved some people off the servicersquos waiting list in order that they can receive a call at this worrying time.Since it launch in , Good Morning Down has supported over  people with a wide range of disabilities and needs and the service it provides to people who live alone has never been more important.While there is concern among the senior citizens they contact and who have been advised to remain in doors for the foreseeable future, there is also great stoicism, with several able to recall hardships that they had to endure during World War Two.Staffed by  volunteers, the charity normally makes around  calls between Monday and Friday but the number has increased to help reassure elderly and vulnerable people that they are not alone.Relocating staff away from their main hub at Innovation House, the charity is unable to pick up any messages that may be left on the Good Morning Down answering machine. To help overcome this a new mobile telephone number is available mdash  .Good Morning Down was established to help reduce loneliness and isolation. Volunteers also signpost those who need further support to other agencies.Good Morningrsquos Down service has never been more important. One of the charityrsquos volunteers, Aidan Harris, says the current climate represents a challenge for everyone, particularly those who live alone.ldquoThe staff moved out of our base at the business park over two weeks ago, but we are providing the service from our own homes and what we are doing is very much appreciated by those we contact every week, he explained.ldquoWe certainly are living in unprecedented times none of us have ever experienced anything like this in our letimes and hopefully will never do again.Aidan explained that while a lot of information people need to hear is circulated via social media, many elderly people do not have access to it. In the main, he said they are relying on the television and radio.ldquoWe are letting them know what is happening and reinforcing the message to stay indoors and not let anyone into their home, even their own relatives. We are highlighting the importance of them doing all that they can not to catch the virus, the charity volunteer continued.ldquoPeople are very concerned at what is going on and many of those whom we contact used to get out to attend ious clubs but they have all closed due to the pandemic which means the elderly and vulnerable are spending even longer alone in their homes.Aidan also revealed that some who normally received only one call a week are now getting several more, with people brought off the waiting list so they can be contacted.He also revealed that the charity is also providing the people they contact with details about local shops which are providing a delivery service.ldquoWe are emphasising the hand hygiene message as much as we can and reminding people to stay indoors. We are also telling them to exercise social distancing and not let anyone into their homes, he said.ldquoWe are also telling those whom we contact not even to let one of their neighbours over the door as it is simply too risky. The people whom we contact are very concerned about what is going on but they are made of stern stuff.Aidan added: ldquoAll the volunteers are working hard to make sure we maintain contact with our clients, more regularly than in the past by increasing the number of calls we make to them.ldquoThe reward is how grateful they are for the service we provide and our main goal is do all we can to let them know that we are here for them and want them to keep safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11250533.jpg","title":"hairdressers beauticians raise funds ppe","story":"It is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Providing that people continue to be generous then there wonrsquot be a problem.As increasing numbers of people self-isolate to protect themselves from the virus, Claire said that the food bank was able to offer deliveriesnecessary.ldquoWe are a very open foodbank. If yoursquove got a need, just ask and we can do our best, said Claire.After the Church in Wales announced the suspension of public acts of worship, the Tabernacle and other churches in Penarth have been finding innovative ways to support their congregation.ldquoFrom this weekend we are going to be streaming virtual services, said Clair.ldquoOur musicians are recording pieces in their homes which will be shared online.ldquoAll our small groups meet on Zoom so wersquore in touch with our congregation.ldquoThe more elderly congregations are keeping in touch by phone and telephone to support them in every way ndash spiritually, emotionally and practically.ldquoThe epidemic is pulling everybody together and cutting across denominational boundaries.The Tabernacle Foodbank is open for donations and collections between am and pm Monday to Friday.You can also deliver donations to their collection point in Sainsburyrsquos on Windsor Road.The foodbank would particularly welcome tinned products, including curry, chilli, corned beef, and potatoes.For more information, visit: Info@tabspenarth or call:  . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
