Meghan is expected to begin the visit by adding her voice to the thousands who have spoken out about the rising violence against women in South Africa.Meghan, who is a champion of gender equality, is likely to raise the issue when her tour of South Africa with husband Harry and their son Archie starts on Monday.The couple\u0027s first event will be a visit to a Township in Cape Town, where they will tour a workshop that provides a range of services to young people, including self-defence classes and female empowerment training to young girls in the community.Campaigners took to the streets of Cape Town earlier this month to protest at what they claimed was their government\u0027s failure to deal with the problem, following a series of attacks that have shocked the African nation.It is understood Meghan and Harry watched the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa\u0027s address to his country following days of protests, when he acknowledged the African nation was facing a national crisis of violence against women.The former actress is an active humanitarian campaigner – particularly on the topic of gender equality – who has spoken about women\u0027s empowerment.Meghan\u0027s activism famously started at a young age. At 11 she forced a soap manufacturer to alter an advert after she wrote a letter to then first lady Hillary Clinton and other high-profile figures complaining that it implied women belonged in the kitchen.The Sussexes\u0027 first tour as a family comes after the duke and duchess flew to Rome to watch Meghan\u0027s close friend, fashion designer Misha Nonoo, marry oil tycoon Michael Hess on Friday.Among the guests at the lavish celebration were Harry\u0027s cousins Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, US president Donald Trump\u0027s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, and actor James Corden.

Visitors have the opportunity to dip in and out, so if you miss one piece you can come back in the same day.”Leckey is returning to Tate Britain for the first time since he won the Turner Prize there in 2008. Always difficult to categorise, his three works explore themes of youth, class, memory and nostalgia.There is one new work and two that are considered seminal to his career. One is Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore from 1990, a compilation of dancefloor footage from Northern soul to rave, which was described in the  as “perhaps the finest portrayal of British nightlife ever captured”.The other is Dream English Kid, 1964-1999 AD, a video work dating from 2015 prompted by Leckey’s discovery of a YouTube video of a Joy Division gig he was at in 1979.The new work in the show stems directly from his memories of the bridge. Under Under In, filmed on iPhones, tells a story of five teenagers under a bridge haunted by fairies, and what happens when one of the children gets abducted.Leckey said his childhood memories were vague ones. “When I was in here yesterday I realised what the show is about, it is about recollection and how things get recalled.”Tate Britain’s director Alex Farquharson said it was less an exhibition and more “an audio-visual play” in which Leckey mixes up “all manner of ways of seeing the world – biography, social history, pop culture, anthropology, magic, the unexplained”.

It is unclear how many of the seven board members support the effort to force Neumann to step down as chief executive. SoftBank and WeWork declined to comment.Even if a majority of WeWork board members support the ousting of Neumann, he could still overrule them because his shares have 10 times the voting rights of other shareholders and he has the power to replace board members. Sources suggested to Reuters that SoftBank was proposing to ask Neumann to become interim chief executive while a headhunting firm was hired to find an external replacement. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Sunday that SoftBank was trying to oust Neumann as chief executive.Neumann, 40, who founded the shared office provider with his friend Miguel McKelvey in 2010, last week admitted to staff that he had been “humbled” by Wall Street’s lukewarm reaction to his plans for an initial public offering (IPO).The company’s expected IPO valuation had already more than halved from the $47bn placed on it when SoftBank pumped in money in the latest funding round in January. The IPO was officially postponed on 16 September, after some bankers suggested it might attract a valuation as low as $15bn.Neumann had been heavily criticised by investors and corporate governance experts for seeking to force through very unusual arrangements that would have given him disproportionate control of the firm.In its initial IPO documents Neumann had called for his shares to carry 20 times the votes of ordinary shares, and for his wife to have a say in selecting his successor should he die. The documents also initially showed that WeWork’s board would include no women. Anger from potential investors caused WeWork to change all of these policies, cutting his voting rights to 10 times those of other investors, removing his wife’s role from succession planning, and adding Frances Frei, an academic at Harvard Business School, to its board.Neumann also repaid $5.9m that the company had paid him in exchange for his trademark of the word “We”.In a sign of the deteriorating relations between SoftBank and WeWork, Neumann did not participate in a gathering of executives of companies backed by SoftBank in Pasadena, California, last week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19cd22590195de67d4bfed0fa9e3f0013563667/0_191_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=009796721bf55082109aa28c85e3fe3e","title":"eurozone economy slows trade brexit manufacturing","story":"German private sector shrinks, contributing to wider manufacturing recession The eurozone economy came close to stalling in September after declines in global trade and the threat of a no-deal Brexit triggered the fastest fall in manufacturing output in nearly seven years.Germany was the main driver of the slump after a survey of private sector activity found that the growing threat to international trade from the tit-for-tat US-China trade war had left it in the worst position since 2009.Often referred to as the powerhouse of the 19-member currency bloc’s economy, Germany has suffered a year-long slowdown that has accelerated in recent months.The German purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for manufacturing fell to 41.4 in September, from 43.5 in the previous month, and well below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.It contributed to a deepening manufacturing recession across the eurozone, where output fell at the sharpest pace since 2012, and optimism among business executives fell to its lowest level for seven years.Car manufacturers were among the worst hit by a rise in Chinese and US import tariffs and preparations for the UK leaving the EU without a deal next month.In a joint statement over the weekend, chiefs from 23 automotive business associations across Europe cautioned against the UK leaving without an agreement, saying it would lead to huge extra costs and possible job losses across the industry, including in the UK.Germany’s overall composite PMI, which includes the services sector and manufacturing industry, was supported by a services sector that continued to expand, though not enough to prevent the PMI slipping to 49.1 from 51.7 in August.The composite PMI for the eurozone fell to 50.4 in September, down from 51.9 in August to signal the weakest expansion of output across manufacturing and services since June 2013.Analysts said the figures, produced by the data firm IHS Markit, revealed that the slowdown in the eurozone’s largest economy justified the European Central Bank’s move earlier this month to cut interest rates and provide a package of stimulus measures to boost growth.IHS Markit said the slowdown was driven by new orders for goods and services falling for the first time since January, to drop at the sharpest rate since June 2013.Simon Wells, chief European economist at HSBC, said: “Today’s PMIs make grim reading, particularly for Germany. Since the peak of the German manufacturing PMI in December 2017, there have been a few occasions where signs of stabilisation have been snuffed out.“The latest falls have added a new leg down after a period of relative stability since the end of the first quarter. With the PMIs now signalling a deeper German manufacturing contraction and increasingly showing the manufacturing sector infecting the service sector, the risk of outright German recession is high.”“The goods-producing sector is going from bad to worse, suffering its steepest downturn since 2012, but a further worrying trend is the broadening-out of the malaise to the service sector, where the rate of growth has now slowed to one of the weakest since 2014,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aab73734da12b8dd29bfde6f1ee3a3e2a8e9443/0_98_4375_2626/master/4375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddfb3208b0eda440d1a2092de6d53ea4","title":"nestle kitkat christmas","story":"Tea-break snack gets gourmet makeover for Christmas, with 1,500 flavour combinationsWe used to be content just nibbling milk chocolate off KitKat fingers, but soon Britons will be able to snack on a “luxury handcrafted” version – for up to £14 a bar – as the tea-break staple gets a gourmet makeover.Bespoke KitKats are expected to be one of this year’s must-have Christmas presents after its owner, the food giant Nestlé, revealed the upmarket KitKat Chocolatory range.Either via a dedicated website, or by visiting a pop-up stall in John Lewis’s flagship London store, shoppers will be able to order a custom KitKat from nearly 1,500 possible flavour combinations. The ingredient choices include rose petals and cocoa nibs and there is the option to coat the fingers in ruby chocolate. It has also produced “special edition” flavours – a surprising line-up that includes marmalade, Earl Grey and “whisky \u0026amp ginger”.Cheryl Allen, who heads KitKat in the UK, said it was a good time to try something new because there was a lot of “buzz” around brand following Instagram-friendly updates such as matcha green tea flavour and ruby chocolate that appealed to younger consumers.“KitKat was launched in the 1930s and one of the reasons it has endured for so long is because it has been able to evolve,” said Allen. “These are luxury, handcrafted chocolates and I think it will positively surprise people how far you can stretch this brand.”But a luxury KitKat comes with a luxury price tag. The 150g eight-fingered bespoke bars – which will be made to order in Yorkshire – cost £14 (a 41.5g four-fingered KitKat usually costs 65p). The special editions start at £7.50.Consumers are gravitating towards craft products, a shift that has created a market for posh versions of everything from mixer drinks to gin and beer. The same trend is obvious in confectionery where incumbents are being forced to rethink their models as fast-growing companies such as Hotel Chocolat bring luxury chocolate to the high street. This is the first time Nestlé’s confectionery arm has launched a direct to consumer business in the UK.Nestlé has borrowed Chocolatory from Japan where it already runs KitKat boutiques under that name. What is a popular tea dunker in the UK is a different biscuit in Japan where it has an upmarket image. It is a popular good luck present (the name resembles kitto katsu which means “you will surely win” in Japanese) and since the millennium more than 300 flavours, including sake, edamame bean and wasabi, have been developed for the gift-giving culture.With customised gifts also a huge trend – named jars of Marmite and tins of Quality Street have been big Christmas hits in recent years – it is also possible to put a message on the KitKat box.John Lewis gift food buyer Rachel Costello predicted they would be popular stocking fillers: “I think our customers will love these exciting new flavours and the experience of making their own KitKat.” A pop-up shop will open in its Oxford Street store on Thursday, and a second will open at Manchester Trafford Centre on 1 October. It is also stocking special edition Kitkats in 30 shops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f404202ca3ce61df55c6f1016c2d985b50e3e793/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6d776c844a8164d294c199a4aeaea45","title":"thomas cook as the world turned the sun ceased to shine on venerable tour operator","story":"Woeful merger, sky-high debts and internet revolution all left the venerable firm strugglingWhy did Thomas Cook fail after 178 years in business? The immediate answer is that it was unable to secure a £200m lifeline from its bankers, including government-owned RBS.But in truth the tour operator’s woes go back much further – a victim of a disastrous merger in 2007, ballooning debts and the internet revolution in holiday booking. Add in Brexit uncertainty, and it was perhaps only a matter of time before the giant of the industry collapsed.In May, the group reported a £1.5bn loss, with more than £1bn written off from the 2007 merger with MyTravel – better known for its brands Airtours and Going Places.That deal was supposed to create a European giant, promising £75m-a-year cost savings and a springboard to challenge emerging internet rivals. In reality Thomas Cook was merging with a company that had only made a profit once in the previous six years, and the deal saddled the group with huge debts.The beneficiaries are Ryanair, easyJet and Airbnb, with all of their customers booking online. The losers are package holiday companies shackled to expensive high street chains. Thomas Cook owns about 560 high street outlets.Just one in seven of us now pop into a high street travel agency to buy a holiday, according to travel agent trade body Abta. Those who do tend to be over 65, and in lower socio-economic groups, with less money to spend.Anglo-German group Tui, Thomas Cook’s biggest rival, has suffered from similar trends, issuing several profit warnings during 2019. But it has much smaller debts, owning many of its own hotels and cruise ships, and arguably could see an uplift as it takes on former Thomas Cook customers, at higher prices.The climate crisis has also had an impact. A Europe-wide heatwave in May 2018 reduced holiday demand sharply, as customers delayed holiday decisions while enjoying record temperatures at home. Then in 2019, Thomas Cook said British customers were postponing travel plans for the summer because of worsening uncertainty around Brexit – and the way it has hit sterling’s buying power abroad.Thomas Cook only narrowly survived a near-death experience in 2011. Its debt pile had already reached £1.1bn, and it stayed afloat only after an emergency additional cash injection - but it also meant even more debt to service.Since 2011 Thomas Cook has paid out £1.2bn in interest, which meant that more than a quarter of the money it charged for the 11m holidays it sold every year went into the pockets of lenders.There was – for a couple of years at least – a corporate saviour, in the form of Chinese group Fosun International, run by Guo Guangchang, a billionaire regarded as China’s Warren Buffett.Fosun bought its first stake in Thomas Cook in 2015, as part of a plan to build a global holiday and entertainment conglomerate, having already taken over France’s Club Med and Canada’s Cirque de Soleil.In August Thomas Cook published details of a planned restructure, which included a £450m cash injection from Fosun in return for a majority stake in the group – which also required the banks to write off £1.7bn in debt. Other existing shareholders would be wiped out.It was that deal that fell apart at the weekend. It was not surprising that the axe fell in late September like most tour operators, Thomas Cook enjoys revenue inflows in the first half of the year as holidaymakers book their summer breaks, but sizeable outflows in autumn and winter when flight and hotel arrangements must be paid for.Some yearn for nationalisation. Critics say the cost of rescue flights and compensation may far outweigh the £200m that Thomas Cook needed to survive another day. But the government refused to step in, arguing that, like failed airline Monarch, it was purely a commercial matter at an inidual business and that customers would be protected by the Atol protection scheme and insurance.How different it was 70 years ago. Thomas Cook was considered such a part of the fabric of British life that it was nationalised in 1948, after facing bankruptcy during the second world war. It remained in public hands, as part of British Railways, until 1972. But now it has been destroyed largely by the internet and changing fashions, hastened along by trying to finance an impossible burden of debt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00ca889b7495e85186fe4bf5be57d13ecd0f7b6a/0_30_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=772c447f153b10e12e3f4aaa6471c2e7","title":"thomas cook debt brexit","story":"Bad management, the banks, Brexit and online rivals also played a role in the travel firm’s demise Why did Thomas Cook go bust?Brexit, risk-averse banks, summer heatwaves, the rise of Airbnb, the long-term triumph of budget airlines. All contributed to the collapse of Thomas Cook. But one factor towers above others: the huge pile of debt – £1.7bn at the last count – that the tour operator has been attempting to shoulder for the past decade.And the key point about the debt is that successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. By the time the board proposed a financial rescue package in July, Thomas Cook was desperate. It needed to hold together a wobbly collection of banks and bondholders in an industry where the whiff of instability can create panic among hoteliers and customers. The task proved impossible, but failure has been a long time in the making.“There is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many UK customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer,” said the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, in May. That account chimed with rivals’ and it is possible that uncertainty around the latest Brexit deadline of 31 October infected the banks’ mood. So, yes, one can say Brexit helped to push an already teetering Thomas Cook closer to the edge.But it cannot be the whole story. Remember that Thomas Cook’s most reliable unit – the Condor airline – serves the German market and it would be stretch to claim Brexit has affected German tourists’ appetite for a holiday in Turkey or the Canaries. Nor has arch-rival Tui, facing the same Brexit headwinds, fallen apart: it has coped because its finances are healthier.Yes, it was a problem, as weather often is for tour operators. Last year’s summer heatwave in the UK and Scandinavia encouraged would-be holidaymakers to stay at home, thereby undermining prices in the “lates” market in which tour operators try to clear unsold holidays. There also seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.But weather, like strikes by French air traffic controllers, is a known risk. Back in 2010, Thomas Cook had a bad year because volcanic ash clouds from Iceland disrupted flights across Europe. The trick is to manage for the unexpected.A pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, but Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year. It also had a partnership deal with Expedia to try to attract the online crowd and was attempting, like Tui, to own more of its own hotels and generate loyalty through “differentiation”.The plan was sensible but reinventing the business model required heavy investment. Thomas Cook was never in a position to throw serious sums of cash around. Fankhauser spoke glowingly about how the Casa Cook and Cook’s Club hotel brands would attract “people who may not have thought a package holiday was for them”, but Thomas Cook was a corporate pauper. It paid £124m in interest charges to its lenders last year, far more than it could spend on investment.The blame game is in full swing. Some Thomas Cook officials suspect lenders, led by Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, were never committed to the financial rescue package, and were instead trying to prolong talks in the hope the government would offer backstop funding and thereby improve the position of creditors.The evidence for that theory seems to be spiralling value of the proposed package – it started at £750m in a recapitalisation backed by Chinese firm Fosum, Thomas Cook’s biggest shareholder then it became £900m then £1.1bn. For their part, the banks argue they have supported an over-stretched company for years. The detail of why the talks failed may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service.Whatever the truth about the weekend drama, it is plain that Thomas Cook’s borrowings were too high. The underlying blame for that position goes back a decade to the deal-making era of former chief executive Manny Fontenla-Novoa.It is astonishing now to remember that, at the end of 2007, soon after the merger with MyTravel, Thomas Cook thought it was so flush with cash that it could spent £290m on buying back its own shares. Within four years, it was fighting administration – successfully on that occasion.The moral of the tale, then as now, is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively. If your balance sheet is fragile, you are at the mercy of events in an industry where most of the cash arrives in the summer and then flows out in the winter.Thomas Cook raised £425m from shareholders in 2013 and seemed to be on a path to improvement as recently as spring last year. In May 2018, the company was worth £2bn. That, in retrospect, was the moment for a shareholder fundraising to deal definitively with the dangerous debt overhang. The summer heatwave had not yet happened at the point and Thomas Cook was making £250m of profit.The window of opportunity was missed, however.Frank Meysman, chairman since 2011, and thus a veteran of Thomas Cook’s first brush with calamity, will have to explain why. He has been virtually invisible in recent days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70a7eb177e807aac8c9751b2c1aa8ce56481e344/0_0_6588_3953/master/6588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18ef3479172a008ebb1c725565930d22","title":"why did they let us book thomas cook holidaymakers turn up at uk airports","story":"Passengers disappointed after booking with collapsed travel firm just weeks agoPassengers scheduled to fly out of the UK with Thomas Cook continued to turn up at Gatwick and Manchester airports on Monday, with some saying they had only learned of the company’s collapse on their way to the airport and others complaining of mounting prices on other airlines.Ruth Caruana, 48, went to the deserted Thomas Cook desk at Gatwick with her husband and daughter to inquire about her flight back home to Malta.“I tried to check in last night, but they wouldn’t let me,” Caruana said. At the airport, she was told by a stand-in Tui member of staff she would have to try to rebook with another airline.“We booked three weeks ago and paid about €700. We’ve been scammed. If they knew they were going to close down they shouldn’t have let us buy the tickets. We have nowhere to stay now. I will now try to get another flight, I hope the insurance will cover it.”John Bell and his family also approached the Thomas Cook desk to get information about their flight to Dalaman, Turkey for a two-week holiday, which puts their return flights outside the period in which passengers with booked plane tickets would be repatriated to the UK by the government.“We found out at 3.30am,” Bell said. “We used a credit card, so hopefully that’ll give us some protection. Everything is getting booked up real fast now, so we don’t know when or if we will be going.”Bell said he thought Brexit could have had something to do with Thomas Cook’s downfall. “Then again, their troubles have been going on for years.”Friends Judy and Sheila were scheduled to fly out for a week’s holiday in Antalya, Turkey and found out about the collapse of the holiday firm when they arrived at Gatwick, where they were handed a Thomas Cook information letter.Thomas Cook owes its name to a humble and deeply religious 32-year-old cabinet-maker who, one June morning in 1841, hiked the 15 miles from his home in Market Harborough to Leicester, to attend a temperance meeting.The former Baptist preacher believed that the ills of Victorian society stemmed largely from alcohol and, presumably fatigued from his walk, realised he could deploy the power of Britain’s flourishing rail network to help spread the word.Addressing the temperance meeting, he suggested that a train be hired to carry the movement’s supporters to the next meeting in Loughborough.Thus, on 5 July 1841, some 500 passengers travelled by a special train for the 24-mile round trip, paying a shilling apiece.Over the next few years, Cook laid on ever more trains, introducing thousands of Britons to train travel for the first time. The first such outing to be run for commercial purposes was a trip to Liverpool in 1845.Over the next decade or so, the business expanded to offer overseas trips, to France, Switzerland, Italy and beyond, to the US, Egypt and India.His more business-minded son John expanded the tour operator and its reach was such that the government enlisted its expertise in an effort, ultimately in vain, to relieve General Gordon at the siege of Khartoum in 1885.John’s three sons inherited the business, which incorporated as Thos Cook \u0026amp Son Ltd in 1924 and benefited from the increasing ease of international travel.Its first flirtation with collapse came during the second world war, when the government requisitioned some of its assets and it was sold to Britain’s railway companies, effectively a nationalisation.But it boomed in the postwar years as growing prosperity fuelled the appetite for holidays and it returned to private ownership in 1972.Since then, it has changed hands and changed shape via a series of mergers and takeovers. It nearly collapsed in 2011 but averted its demise with a bailout deal funded by banks.Now, after 178 years of operation, it has ceased trading.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLike many others, they had booked a package via a third-party operator just two weeks ago, which included flights with Thomas Cook.“We even have our boarding passes for our flight that is now not going to happen,” Sheila said. “We were told to try and rebook. Our travel operator said we should pay for new tickets and we would then get reimbursed, but I’m sure any extras like transfers we’ll have to pay for will leave us out of pocket.”They were able to rebook tickets for a flight leaving before 10pm with another airline, for a “small fortune”, and were told by their travel operator they would be refunded for the original cost of the Thomas Cook flights.“I asked, ‘What about the additional cost?’ but they haven’t said anything about that,” Judy said.“All I want to do is lie down,” Sheila added.By midday, there were only a handful of travellers still queueing at the Thomas Cook customer service desk at Gatwick.Stranded passengers booked to fly on cancelled Thomas Cook flights from Manchester airport complained of rising prices on other airlines.Apart from a few stranded passengers frantically trying to book other flights, the former Thomas Cook check-in desks at terminal one stood eerily empty of staff and queues, with the branding removed.Wedding planner Catalena Fernandes had been due to fly home to Cancún, Mexico on Monday morning. She had been travelling around the UK for two weeks and had two weddings scheduled for this week in Mexico.She added: “I am searching for other flights but I needed to be there today. I don’t know what I’ll do. It is a difficult situation.”Kristina Terwilliger was in Manchester, supposedly in transit, but had been stranded for four hours. She had flown from Glasgow, with a flight booked to JFK airport in New York to visit family on Condor Airlines, a subsidiary owned by Thomas Cook.Last night the airline said it would continue operations, but Terwilliger arrived to find her flight cancelled. “They let me through and sent my bag to JFK, it was on the way and they had to get it back. I’ve talked to Condor, there’s no way to get through to Thomas Cook. There’s nothing, no contact with Thomas Cook, no money back.“It’s just that getting a flight out of here is just hard in general and prices are just going up and up. Everyone is trying to get out of here.”Sidney Matias was trying to get home to Orlando after a holiday in the UK. He said: “I’ve had no information. I bought an extra bag yesterday, which they charged me for, so I woke up this morning and I came to the airport. I didn’t know they were going to be cancelled. The only information is these guys gave me a piece of paper so I’m going to have to buy another flight.”“When I arrived at security, my boarding card flashed up to seek assistance. So now I’ve got to try to get to New York today from somewhere but the train station is closed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6bd405e3cf1dcda6fb6fc9ecac56c5e418cfc9/0_127_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7141e88fe9e9e8c6b9488d06a6e921a8","title":"you give don a voice couriers widow praises ken loach film sorry we missed you ","story":"Gig economy film Sorry We Missed You is partly inspired by the death of Ruth Lane’s husbandThere is a scene in Sorry We Missed You, Ken Loach’s new film about a parcel courier driven to the brink by his brutal gig economy job, when his wife finally loses patience with his ruthless depot controller and screams at him to give her disintegrating husband a break.“Isn’t that funny,” whispered Ruth Lane as she watched the first UK public screening on Sunday night in Brighton. “I went into the depot office and shouted at Don’s manager, complaining that he didn’t have time to eat. I said you are bloody killing him. You are working him so hard.”Don Lane, a courier for DPD, which delivers for retailers including Next and Asos, was Ruth’s husband who collapsed and died aged 53 in January 2018 after working through illness in the Christmas delivery rush. His story has partly inspired Loach’s follow up to I, Daniel Blake, which goes on general release on 1 November, and now his widow was having the “surreal” experience of seeing her own life’s tragic events played out on the big screen at the Brighton Odeon on the fringes of the Labour party conference.Don Lane had skipped several hospital appointments to treat his type 1 diabetes because he had been charged £150 by DPD when he missed deliveries to attend an appointment and feared further charges. He collapsed twice while working, including once at the wheel, and was ill and vomiting blood before he died but did not take time off. Ruth Lane is now mounting a legal challenge against the company, which made a £121m profit in 2017 and paid its top executive a salary close to £1m. It is contesting her claims that he should have been treated as a worker with holiday pay and a guaranteed minimum wage, and that its decision to charge him for missing work to attend hospital was disability discrimination.The parallels between fact and fiction came thick and fast for Lane in a film that tackles the emotional and social impact of the shift of financial risk on to workers in the rapidly growing gig economy, which involves 4.7 million people in Britain doing jobs including delivering parcels, caring for sick and elderly people, or driving minicabs.As Loach’s hero Ricky, a father of two in Newcastle, nodded off at the wheel or raced to deliver parcels in strict one-hour windows for the fictional company PDF (Parcels Delivered Fast), Lane sighed. “Don got breached for being three minutes late on one of those,” she said, as Ricky was rebuked again for missing a “precise”.When the fictional Ricky insisted on doing his round despite being battered and bruised after a robbery from his van, which the depot boss – “the patron saint of nasty bastards” – says will cost him over £1,000, Lane wonders what her husband was going through in the days before he died. After the film, when the screenwriter Paul Laverty told the audience about Don’s story, her eyes filled with tears.Lane found her husband collapsed in the living room of their cottage and she and their 23-year-old son, Jordon, went with him in an ambulance to hospital, but to no avail.“I think we should remember there are much worse cases than Ricky’s story,” said Laverty.“It’s surreal,” said Lane, who works at a Marks \u0026amp Spencer in Bournemouth. “People at work say: ‘What did you do at the weekend?’ I’ve gone to a screening of a film partly based on my husband’s death.”“You give Don a voice and it’s blowing me away,” she told Laverty, whose research partly followed the ’s reporting of the impact of the gig economy. “If he had had his treatment he would have been here.”“It’s out of respect,” said Laverty. “It is something that shouldn’t have happened.”Lane was not the only person with personal experience of the pernicious effects of companies’ rising use of self-employed contractors. Max Dewhurst, a cycle courier and trade union activist in London, reflected that the film was “like watching a documentary”.“I know families being torn apart and the impact it has on their children, people falling asleep at the wheel, people being beaten up for their parcels.”The film’s events are less catastrophic than Don Lane’s story, depicting the impact of a business’s remorseless quest for profit on a person’s fragile family life and mental health.As Ruth Lane said, a film rendition of her husband’s story might not seem believable his death would perhaps come across melodramatic. It was a view echoed by Laverty. While the film tackles the emotional turmoil of gig economy work, it leaves hanging the question of what the ultimate consequences might be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925b8940038c7e8af6799ddb87b2e390b52f7999/0_177_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a630f084d0250791b33810ab87720874","title":"organise to resist the radical posters of the paddington printshop","story":"Operating from an old factory in north-west London, John Phillips and the Paddington Printshop revolutionised the promotion of squatters’ rights and housing campaigns throughout the 1970s and 80sJohn Phillips opened the Paddington Printshop in an old taxi-meter factory off the Harrow Road in 1974, and began making event and campaign posters for everybody “from the vicar to the anarchists” – what Phillips describes as the entire “rainbow coalition” of leftwing interests.In addition to promoting such international causes such as the anti-apartheid movement, many of its posters were about local housing issues in this particular corner of west London, including squatters’ rights, housing associations, hostile developers and derelict land.Customers were charged at different rates: squatters simply covered the cost of material, while groups receiving grants were asked to pay a little more. Posters were generally “double crown” – that’s 20” by 30” – and screen-printed in runs of between 150 and 300 before being plastered around nearby streets.“The style was fairly eclectic,” says Phillips. “We wanted to help people express themselves or find a form of expression for the campaign that was appropriate. Many of them hadn’t picked up a pencil since childhood. For the left in those days there were only two colours in their vocabulary – red and black – and many of their images were from the 1930s, so we were trying to open people up to contemporary images.”As well as providing a dash of background colour, the posters helped reshape the landscape of the area. One dramatic example was the creation of Meanwhile Gardens, a playground carved out of derelict land.“That was our friend the artist Jamie McCullough,” says Phillips. “He had this idea you could shape wasteland with a JCB like a sculpture. We made posters, helped set up a charity and found the workforce. Through the studio we had a very wide social network and were able to use that to help projects like Meanwhile. It was intended to be temporary, hence the name.”Another major campaign saw Phillips create the Iron Man – a businessman with the face of a digger. It began in 1986 when Westminster council tried to sell the Walterton and Elgin estates to a private developer. This happened to be the area where the Paddington Printshop was then located, and Phillips worked alongside residents to fight back, creating a range of images to support the campaign.Other posters addressed two related issues – squatters and empty homes. North Kensington had numerous squats. There were dozens in Elgin Avenue, where Piers Corbyn was based, while the 101’ers were named after the squat at 101 Walterton Road.Over in Freston Road, the writer and activist Heathcote Williams helped create the independent republic of Frestonia, which attempted to secede from the UK. Phillips printed posters for squatter benefits for Frestonia for campaigns against a proposed criminal trespass law that people feared would make squatting a criminal rather than civil offence and for a squatters advisory service that offered the squatting community legal advice as well as acting as an underground estate agent, spreading the word about empty properties.Another campaign came at the problem from a different angle. While the squatters were largely white and middle-class, poorer residents, many from black communities, were desperate for secure and clean rented accommodation. Posters called out poor housing conditions, shaming housing associations and councils.“The ‘red cross’ campaign began with people who were on the housing association boards and wanted their organisations to refurbish properties rather than buy to invest,” Phillips says. “They would give the addresses of empty properties to community workers. We’d then spray them with biblical red crosses and use posters to explain what it meant. Then the board members would attend board meeting and say ‘have you seen what’s happening out there…?’ It became a national issue.”The print shop continued to produce posters for the local community – concerts, the Notting Hill carnival and festivals – alongside more radical topics, but community activities tapered off in the 1980s as the sector’s funding dried up.The print shop formally closed in 1991 when Phillips transferred the assets to a new charitable organisation, London Print Studio. Based at 425 Harrow Road, it continues to work on community projects as well as with artists, galleries and educational institutions. Phillips made a poster for Grenfell but otherwise rarely works in that medium today.“There was a strong poster culture then,” he says. “People thought about posters and owned them and understood them. There isn’t a poster culture now. Our posters contributed to campaigns. They indicated to the council and public that these were strong organisations they were up against and they contributed significantly to internal morale.”Posters from Paddington Printshop is published by Four Corners BooksFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a757caa7c4c852ff96bdcbfb56578f7ca96f0d1c/162_48_3338_2286/master/3338.jpg?width=1140\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0eced4c069eb9c592d8d4a52a3c7fbb2 2280w","title":"ancient turkish town of hasankeyf begins to disappear under water in pictures","story":"The small town of Hasankeyf, in Turkey’s Kurdish-majority south-east, is doomed to disappear in the coming months after being inhabited for 12,000 years.

Grassroots initiatives can help bring us together “I’ve given up watching the news,” said the man in the other room. “It’s all lies.”We were both in a hi-fi shop in Bath – me immersed in an arcane conversation about amplifiers, while he asked for help with his internet-enabled flatscreen television. He was sixtysomething, with the look of someone being endlessly annoyed by the world, or what he saw of it. These days, he said, all his information about current affairs came from online videos. What, I wondered, was he watching? Claims of faked bombings in Syria? False warnings about the dangers of vaccines? Or labyrinthine theories about the global cabal intent on stopping Brexit?Here, it seemed, was an example of something self-evident but also endlessly overlooked: the fact that, as our Darwinian economy has pushed various parts of society apart, the most bog-standard technology has even further eroded the common ground that the most basic notions of democracy – and even civilisation – depend on.YouTube, along with the usual social media platforms, is hardly the only problem. Last week Channel 4’s chief executive, Alex Mahon, gave a speech at the Royal Television Society that was focused on the increasing power of such streaming services as Amazon Prime and Netflix. “The global telly of the future will not be – and isn’t being – designed to reflect Britain back to itself, to bring the nation together at particular moments, to inform and educate a particular society or to care about promoting any kind of social cohesion,” she said. Put the kinds of media together, and things look bleak: if we’re not careful, people will soon be watching hopelessly partisan outlets for questionable “news”. Meanwhile, politicians will rejoice in the fact that the traditional media they often encourage their supporters to loathe – with its insistence on long interviews, and something approaching proper scrutiny – will at last be only a marginal part of the political game.As evidenced by the Tories’ frantic electioneering on Facebook, the supposedly looming election looks set to mark another big step into this new world. Meanwhile, as these changes gather pace, some people in the established media already seem so terrified that they have reduced their old obligations to report, explain and enlighten. Instead of giving a sense of what is actually going on in the world, too much current affairs broadcasting now consists of online agitators yelling at each other in person, while some high-profile presenters regularly join the crowd of belligerents. So long as some kind of balance is maintained, the veneer of what used to be called public service broadcasting might be just about sustained. Up close, it is nothing of the kind.Which brings us to Brexit. The idea that the referendum of 2016 could have settled the questions it was designed to answer – not just about our membership of the EU, but also what kind of country we collectively wished to be – is now so laughable as to seem completely absurd. Clearly, it did the absolute reverse: thanks to our polarising mediascape and the UK’s awful inequalities and imbalances, it simply hardened the ision between a broadly liberal constituency and a coalition of people from both post-industrial places and more wealthy areas who have a more conservative, nationalistic view of the world – and then gave each camp a word to describe itself. Three years on, the gap between hardcore leavers and remainers is still widening. If there is any hope, it lies with the weary millions who sit somewhere in the middle, but they still seem too disengaged to make their voices heard.“Bringing the country back together” is the political cliche of 2019. But in the midst of all the polarised noise, just about every mainstream political response to the Brexit crisis looks like it will either further our isions, or leave things much as they are. The Tories’ embrace of the headless politics of no deal, coupled with the picking of fights clearly designed to show they mean it, is by far the most egregious example. By way of a mirror-image, the Liberal Democrats’ new belief in ignoring the referendum result simply encourages the most partisan remainers to rejoice in ision and self-righteousness. Labour’s belated offer of a second referendum – with, if Jeremy Corbyn gets his way, the party’s position to be decided by a “special conference” some time after the election – is probably the best thing on offer. But does anyone seriously think that another referendum campaign and a public vote would really settle the furies that Brexit has kicked up? In the absence of a no-deal option Nigel Farage and the Brexit party, using their online expertise, alongside Tory Brexiteers, would decry the whole thing as illegitimate. And whatever the result, the losing side would hardly be likely to go quiet.There are flashes of hope, nonetheless. Travelling around, I see them in the nitty-gritty community initiatives that bring people together, and cut across the idea that we are all hopelessly estranged in the new breed of town and parish councils that want nothing to do with ideological war, and spend their time patiently making improvements to places in the droves of people who are unfamiliar with the latest Twitter controversy, and are keener to talk about their yearning for community and security. In that same spirit, we need more programmes like the BBC Two documentary series The Mighty Redcar, and less like Question Time. A lot of us need a renewed willingness to see things from the other side’s perspective, and rediscover the common humanity and acceptance of compromise that so often seems to be lacking from everyday politics. One obvious example: if you have stopped talking to a friend or relative because they voted leave, it is probably time you gave them a call. You could maybe have a conversation about whether – in the midst of all this chaos and strife – something like Theresa May’s original withdrawal agreement would really be that bad.Perhaps, as some of Labour’s more devout supporters think, a Corbyn-led government might successfully get to grips with Britain’s basic problems and start to heal our wounds. Although, judging by the events of the weekend, putting those people in charge might threaten to add even more ision and acrimony to the helping we have already.If there is even the faintest chance of some kind of collective pushback against our growing culture of mutual loathing, it needs to begin with recognition of how it is sustained. When I talk to people with the most passionate political opinions, I often have the feeling of moving between different universes. One question is always obligatory: where do you get your information? In response, more and more people reach for their phones, open YouTube, Facebook or Twitter and show a tweet or meme that has reaffirmed their prejudices and added to all those northern Californian fortunes.In 2017 Mark Zuckerberg said his company’s mission was to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together”. Even in an age of such rampant absurdity, that is surely among the most ridiculous things anyone has ever said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea17a7aefe0ee7bbc5a3dc04bd68be7464a3dbec/1255_0_4745_2847/master/4745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1690c14abcc1401d9ea89b4512305f7","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of bored","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘bored’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘bored’.Share your photos of what bored means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 25 September at 10am.

And it followed Rayner’s announcement that Labour would overhaul school inspections in England by abolishing Ofsted, a proposal that received a mixed welcome by teachers and prompted accusations of lowering standards by its opponents.Sunday’s controversial step on private schools, which would represent a existential threat to their dominance of the most influential roles in the establishment, was greeted enthusiastically by the Abolish Eton campaign, which has pushed the issue up the party’s agenda.Holly Rigby, a campaign organiser and state school teacher said: “This is a really positive moment for the Labour party because it’s the strongest commitment that the party has made to deal with the problem of private schools in a very long time. It’s a really radical commitment as well … This is a really big victory for the left.”But Julie Robinson, the chief executive of the Independent Schools Council, which represents about 1,000 private schools in England including Eton, said Labour’s vote was an attack on the rights of parents.“Tearing down excellent schools does not improve our education system. The repercussions would be irreversible and far-reaching, damaging educational opportunities and limiting life chances. Moreover, Labour’s plan would breach the European Convention on Human Rights on the right to choose education,” Robinson said.Rayner said she backed the efforts, and said that a new social justice commission would be tasked with integrating private schools into the state system.“Our very first budget will immediately close the tax loopholes used by elite private schools and use that money to improve the lives of all children,” Rayner said.Labour also set out a major shake up of Ofsted, with Rayner telling conference delegates in Brighton: “Schools will no longer be reduced to a one-word grade or subjected to a system that hounds teachers from the classroom.”Instead Rayner promised “a new system of peer review will deliver school improvement led by the experts in our schools who can achieve more working together for the common good”.The survey also found little support among teachers for Ofsted in its current form. Mary Bousted, the co-head of the National Education Union, gave Labour’s plans a forceful endorsement, saying Ofsted was unfit for its purpose. “Teachers and school leaders know from bitter experience that too many Ofsted inspectors have neither the knowledge or professional experience to come to accurate judgements of schools,” she said.But Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, accused Labour of pursuing dogma that would leave children at greater risk.“Labour are putting ideology before the education of our children. Parents will be rightly fearful of Corbyn’s plans to abolish independent inspections, scrap Sats and destroy academies and free schools. Labour would weaken discipline, lower standards and reduce choice and information for parents,” Williamson said in response to the Ofsted announcement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5798826a4e3447600dceeef5487060390cc4543b/0_265_2328_1397/master/2328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3587c64d7cf1526b754abc6ba6ad58b6","title":"i wish id delayed coming to the uk overseas students call for further visa extensions","story":"Foreign students will be offered a two year work visa after graduating from a British university in 2021. But students currently enrolled will miss outInternational students at British universities fear the government’s plan to offer two-year post-study work visas to future students could leave them worse off if the extra time is not given to them too.Last week the government said foreign students will be offered a two-year work visa after graduating from a British university. But the new policy will only apply to those graduating from summer 2021, according to the announcement.The current immigration policy, controversially put in place by Theresa May in 2012, gives students just four months to find work after graduating.Over 16,000 people have already signed a petition calling on the government to extend the new visa rules to international students currently studying in the UK.The petition states: “There are thousands of international students currently studying in the UK and gaining valuable skills. spoke to current international students about their concerns:Umair Qamar, from Pakistan, recently graduated from De Montfort University with a master’s in cyber security. He wants to find a job before his visa runs out.“I’ve been applying for jobs since I came to this country. It’s been a difficult and disappointing experience. I’ve lost count of how many positions I’ve applied for, but my CV is all over the UK. I’ve had lots of rejections because the company didn’t want to sponsor students. It’s almost impossible for international students to get jobs at the moment. But I’m still trying.“I’m happy to hear other students will get the two year visa. But I want to point out that it would benefit the government to extend the deadline for current students, too. We are very dedicated and work hard. The recent change means there is hope.”Muhammad Junaid Asif Sahi, from Pakistan, is doing a master’s in transport planning and engineering at Edinburgh Napier University.“The current four-month bracket for students is a mere formality and a bureaucratic way of saying, ‘get the degree and go back home’, because companies want someone they can hire without hassle.“I’d like to stay in the UK but I don’t know if I’ll be able to. It’s all so confusing. Some reports say students graduating in 2020 will get the extension, but others say you have to graduate in 2021, so I don’t know who will be affected. This makes me feel nervous about my future. If the UK government has decided to let international students stay longer, why wait a couple of years to implement it?”Hassan Sheikh did an undergraduate degree at the University of Manchester and is due to begin a master’s this year.“We’ve been told the extension applies to students graduating in 2021 and after and it’s unclear whether it will apply to those graduating in 2020. If it doesn’t apply to those of us graduating then, I worry employers will wait a year to hire international students so they don’t need to deal with the hassle of sponsoring visas. In that sense I think current students like me could now be worse off than before the announcement was made. Because it just puts us in the middle of nowhere.”Jessica Martins, from Brazil, has just handed in her dissertation for her master’s in corporate communications, marketing and public relations at the University of Leeds. Her visa is due to run out in January.“I think the extension should also be available for people who are currently here. I’m happy new students will have the opportunity to stay longer. But it’s also frustrating for me, because I would have liked to stay too. I don’t regret coming to the UK, but I spent a lot of money and I’m not sure whether my degree will help me to get jobs back home if I don’t have work experience. If I’d known this would happen, I would have waited two more years to come to the UK.”Laura*, from the US, graduated from King’s College, London with a master’s in European politics in 2018. She was forced to leave the UK four months later after being unable to find work before the deadline.“Leaving the UK was the worst day of my life. I ended up on the floor of Gatwick, sobbing. I couldn’t stand up because I was crying so hard. I had made a home, I had a boyfriend, I had a social circle, then I had to leave. When I got back to America, I was depressed and suicidal.“Both my degrees focused on UKEU relations and I got a distinction for my dissertation, which was on Brexit. I feel my qualifications could be useful to British employers as the country prepares to leave the EU. But I sent over 100 applications and companies told me it was too risky to hire foreigners.“As angry as I am, I want to go back to the UK because I’m now in professional limbo. The hostile environment has to end some time and this is a welcome first step. When I heard the announcement it was the first time in my life that I cried from happiness. For the first time I feel there’s a chance I could get my life back again.”Riddi Viswanathan, from India, is a former international student and International Student Officer at the University of Manchester and now works for the university.“I’ve been fighting for this extension for five years, so I’m delighted to hear the government has made a U-turn. The current four months isn’t long enough and puts enormous pressure on people. I’ve seen students struggle, staying up all night to do their dissertation just so they can apply for jobs during the day. I graduated a year ago and many companies rejected me because they didn’t want to sponsor my tier two visa. I became involved in politics specifically to change this.“But I’m afraid the good news will undermine other challenges international students face. Tuition fees, already high for international students, could rise further for those from the EU. There’s no certainty around the settlement scheme, EU funding, or the future of Erasmus after Brexit. While for non-EU students, the cost of getting a visa has risen, along with the immigration health surcharge. It also doesn’t help current students, who feel stuck in the middle. And so extending the post-study work visa is one good step, but it’s not the end for international students.”* Laura’s surname has been omitted at her request."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da7a452de9bf95f65c4fca9c2ab4d90ff479152d/0_151_4565_2741/master/4565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9064e8adc6168a1ccf78c374b5ac1260","title":"milan fashion week springsummer 2020 14 key shows in pictures","story":"From J-Lo and Donatella Versace breaking the internet, to Prada favouring timeless style over fashion, the Italian capital had plenty of memorable moments this season "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44c85845ea0d39fdfbcedec8fbe1b5092def5e5f/0_3382_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6644ed7cb3667c84420d4e5fa81c98f6","title":"observer food monthly 20 best easy autumn recipes","story":"Anna Jones’s apple and pear crisp and Claudia Roden’s tagliatelle – our favourite recipes for when the nights draw inOf an occasional Sunday evening, Dad would make the most delicious mushrooms on toast. Well, actually, he didn’t make toast rather, he would make the most delicious, perfect squares of immaculately fried bread. It seems obvious when you think about it, for however well-toasted is a slice of bread – even the most accommodating of crusty sourdough – it will, inevitably, begin to slightly sog about halfway through munching. But a nicely thick slice of fried bread will hold its own until the last mouthful. Always the thoughtful and considered cook, my dear old dad.His mother, not the most inspired, kitchen-wise, would have simply opened a can of Chesswood creamed mushrooms and warmed them through on the Aga. Bbut she did fry the bread. . … though possibly not as well as did her son. His trick was to lightly spread each surface with a smear of good dripping, then fry it on each side in a dry frying pan until super-crisp. His mushrooms were always button, cut in half, stewed in butter, a dusting of flour added and then milk stirred in until a smooth, thick-ish sauce was achieved if there was some cream (or top-of-milk) in the fridge, a spoonful or two of that to finish. I have always believed he wanted to recreate that can of Chesswood’s but simply because our mother would never have countenanced such slovenly convenience, he made them his own.Shall we upgrade a little? We shall. Then creamed morels on fried bread, it shall be.Serves 2dried morels 20g (the tinier, the finer)boiled water 150g butter a thick slice salt and pepperwhite bread 2 thick-ish slices, crustless duck fat or butter medium sherry 50g dry vermouth 50g shallot 1 small, chopped garlic a scrap, crushedflour 1 tsp whipping cream 100g lemon juice a healthy squeeze chives ½ tbsp, snippedPut the morels into a bowl, cover with the boiling water and leave to soak for at least 30 minutes. Lift out with a slotted spoon into a small saucepan, pop in the butter and add a little seasoning. Put to cook over a very low light, stirring together until the butter has melted and allow to stew for about 10 minutes, covered, really slowly.Sparsely spread the white bread with duck fat (or butter) and quietly fry on each side until golden and crisp.Strain the morel-soaking liquid, using a tea strainer, into another small saucepan and add the sherry, vermouth, shallot and garlic. Simmer until reduced by about two-thirds.Add the flour to the morels, stir around for a minute or 2, then strain in the reduced morel liquor. Simmer till thickened, then stir in the cream. Continue to simmer, uncovered, for a few minutes until the sauce is nicely clinging to the morels and is of a lovely ivory colour. Stir in the lemon juice and chives, then carefully spoon over the fried bread sprinkle over a few extra chives, if you wish, just to pretty the thing.

Peel and slice the garlic and cut into thin slivers, insert under the chicken skin at regular intervals. Rub the bird with the half lemon, squeezing the juice over it. Season sparingly with salt, more liberally with pepper, and paprika if you like it.Heat the butter in a cast iron casserole and lightly brown the chicken all over. Remove the bird and stuff it with as much of the quince as you can. Return it to the pan with any remaining quince tucked in around it and pour the cider over. Bring to a simmer. Cover with a lid and place in the oven. After an hour, remove the chicken, place it on an ovenproof dish and return to the oven to crisp the skin.Meanwhile, sieve the juices from the pot and reduce on the hob until syrupy, then reserve to serve with the roasted bird.Thanks to Fine Food Specialist for sourcing the quincesThis is everything I want in an autumn pudding. Melting orchard fruits spiked with ginger and cardamom and a topping that’s half crisp and half crumble, which reminds me of oatmeal cookies. I eat this with thick Greek yogurt mixed with a little honey and vanilla or, if it’s really cold, good hot vanilla custard.Serves 4-6apples 3 pears 3 maple syrup 2 tbsp prunes 75g dried figs 50g candied ginger, 2 pieces, finely chopped unwaxed lemon 1 vanilla pod 1, seeds scraped (or 1 tsp vanilla paste)ground cinnamon ½ tsp ground cardamom ½ tsp For the toppingrolled oats 100g ground almonds 50g butter or coconut oil 100g light brown sugar 75g white spelt flour 100g salt a small pinch To serveGreek or coconut yogurt whipped with a little vanilla and honeyPreheat your oven to 200Cgas mark 6.Peel the apples and pears and roughly slice them. Toss them with the maple syrup in a roasting tray and cover the tray with foil. Roast for 15 minutes in the hot oven, then remove the foil and roast for a further 10 minutes until the edges catch and caramelise.Meanwhile, roughly chop 50g of the prunes and all the figs, finely chop the ginger, and place the whole lot into the bottom of a 24cm round (or equivalently sized) baking dish. Grate over the lemon zest and add the juice of ½ the lemon, add the vanilla and spices and mix everything together. Cover the dish with a clean tea towel and leave to one side.Make the topping by rubbing the oats, almonds, butter, sugar, flour and salt together with your fingers. It will feel wetter than a crumble topping and you’ll be left with larger pieces of butter, but you should have a very rough crumbly dough after about 4 minutes. Chop the remaining prunes roughly and mix them through too.When your apples are ready, mix them with the fruit and spices in the baking dish, then sprinkle over the topping. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes, until deep golden.I serve mine with some Greek or coconut yogurt, whipped with a little vanilla and honey.From The Modern Cook’s Year: Over 250 vibrant vegetable recipes to see you through the seasons by Anna Jones (Fourth Estate, £26)Piedmontese tagliatelle, called tajarin, with butter and parmesan are one of the best ways to enjoy a white truffle because they do not interfere with its sensational aroma. The Piedmontese white truffles are the most prized and extremely expensive. They must be used very fresh as they lose their aroma at an accelerating pace – their season is between the end of September and mid January – or preserved in jars or tins, which are not quite as scented as fresh ones.Serves 4white truffle 1 small unsalted butter 125gparmesan 40g, grated salt and freshly ground black peppernutmeg a grating tagliatelle 300g, or fettuccineTruffles are generally exported already cleaned. If you need to clean your white truffle, scrub it with a stiff brush and rub it with a moist cloth. Melt the butter and add the grated parmesan and a little salt, pepper and nutmeg. Boil the tagliatelle or fettuccine until al dente, drain quickly and serve immediately, tossed with the melted butter mixture. Shave a little white truffle over each serving with a mandolin or a potato peeler.Variation Black summer truffles from Umbria are relatively cheap – you can buy them fresh in season from October to March – and they are available preserved in jars in some British supermarkets. Their flavour is not as sensational as that of white truffles but it is distinctive and delicate. For 2 small portions of Umbrian tagliatelle con tartufi nerri, cook 100g tagliatelle and prepare the sauce at the same time: bring to the boil 200ml double cream with a few drops of truffle oil (to taste), 2 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan, a little salt and a finely grated small black truffle. When the tagliatelle are al dente, drain and mix them in the pan with the truffle sauce.From The Food of Italy by Claudia Roden (Square Peg, £30)Za’atar is a Palestinian spice mix made from wild thyme, sesame and sumac that has an affinity with sweet root vegetables. Here it is used to make crunchy, tangy croutons to adorn an aromatic soup of roasted butternut squash and spiced lentils. Roasting the squash intensifies its flavour and sweetness, and gives the soup a glorious silky texture that perfectly contrasts with the crispy croutons.Serves 4butternut squash 1kg, peeled, deseeded and cut into 3cm pieceslight olive oilonions 2, finely choppedgarlic 4 cloves, crushedcumin seeds ¾ tsp coriander seeds ¾ tsp ground cinnamon ½ tsp red lentils 160g, rinsedvegetable or chicken stock 750ml lemon juice of ½sea salt and freshly ground black pepperFor the toppingsstale bread 2 slices (I like to use sourdough for taste and texture)za’atar 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oilparsley or coriander leaves choppedPreheat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6.Place the butternut squash on a baking tray and drizzle with light olive oil. Toss the chunks so they are evenly coated in the oil, then roast for 20-30 minutes, until they are soft.Heat 3 tablespoons light olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onions and fry for 10 minutes over a medium heat. Add the garlic, reduce the heat and cook for another few minutes.Meanwhile, toast the cumin and coriander seeds by stirring them in a dry pan over a low heat for a minute until their aromas are released. Grind the seeds in a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, then add them and the cinnamon to the saucepan with the softened onions. Fry the spices for a few minutes.Add the lentils and 1 litre of just-boiled water. Cover and simmer the soup for 10 minutes.Once the lentils have softened, add the squash, stock, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Leave to simmer for another 10 minutes.Once the lentils are fully cooked, take the pan off the heat and blend the soup with a hand-held blender. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your preference.To make the croutons, roughly chop the bread into 3cm chunks. Heat 3 tablespoons light olive oil in a frying pan and, once it is very hot, add the bread and sprinkle over the za’atar. Fry the bread, stirring frequently, until it is toasted and crunchy. Place the croutons on some kitchen paper to soak up any excess oil. To serve, ladle the soup into warmed bowls, top with the croutons and finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkling of chopped herbs.From Zaitoun: Recipes and Stories from the Palestinian Kitchen by Yasmin Khan (Bloomsbury, £26)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63066c5606a6e539ca23e6134a46582bf52146e1/0_33_7966_4781/master/7966.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54d45445baf0842d0aa24373c7080de7","title":"rachel roddy italian confit chicken recipe pollo sott ollio","story":"Confit chicken, or pollo sott’olio, slow-cooked in a bath of fragrant extra-virgin olive oil on a bed of herbs and zestIt is estimated that fragments of 53m terracotta amphorae once containing olive oil make up Monte Testaccio in Rome. The hill was constructed between the first century BC and the third century AD, when billions of litres of oil from Baetica (modern-day Spain), Tripolitania (Libya) and Byzacena (Tunisia) were imported into imperial Rome. This was not simply oil for drizzling on leaves, but fuel for an empire – for lamps, cleaning, balm, perfume and medicine. Once the oil was decanted, the impregnated amphorae couldn’t be reused – which is why they were smashed and, in highly organised feats of stacking, made into a hill that rose nonchalantly, the Leonard Cohen of landmarks, in the middle of Rome.Over the centuries, the hill – which stands at 35m and has a circumference of half a mile – has taken on a life of its own: grass, shrubs and trees have taken root on its slopes restaurants, nightclubs and mechanics at its base. Depending from where you approach it, Monte Testaccio can look like a woodland wilderness, a hub of charming trattorie, a scruffy and seedy clubland, an urban farm or a neatly stacked exhibit. It is from inside Testaccio’s other unlikely landmark, a former slaughterhouse, that you can best understand the monte, the pieces of broken pot visible on the slopes.The slaughterhouse and olive oil pot hill are just two of the many reasons Testaccio feels so edible. It was appropriate, I thought, that I passed both on my way to see a man about a recipe for chicken in olive oil.Domenico Cortese comes from Tropea, a town almost at the tip of the toe of Italy’s boot, famous for its sweet red onions. The eldest of five children, his grandfather and father were both butchers, and he grew up around the family shop. He learned his father’s vocation, and found it was not his own. His career as a chef is a sort of careful stacking of experience: near his mum as a kid in hotels as a teenager as a dishwasher and the chef at an Italian restaurant called Messina, in Rotterdam as a private chef to the Argentinian ambassador in Rome head of a police canteen sous chef in the American Academy in Rome running a supper club with his Danish partner and baker, Sophie.Now they have their own place, Marigold, which seems like a culmination of all the layers of experience and hard work: an oasis of exceptional food, just beyond the hill of olive oil pots. While Domenico’s great skill is undoubtedly pasta and vegetables, I particularly appreciate his use of herbs and citrus, and the way he brings out flavour, which is apparent in this, his recipe for chicken with many herbs, lemon, orange and ginger, cooked sott’olio – under oil, or confit.Domenico is unequivocal about using extra-virgin olive oil, for its unrivalled flavour and conduction: oil diffuses heat better than air, which is why meat confined and cooked under oil is so tender and almost velvet-like, rich but, surprisingly, not fatty. With cost in mind, he concedes that you could use half olivehalf vegetable oil. Either way, it should almost cover the legs (about 800ml) – only the very top of the skin should be above the oil.Another pleasure of this dish is the scent, in preparation and at the end of cooking when the blackened herbs, garlic, wrinkled strips of citrus and ginger make the hardworking olive oil seem like a balm or kitchen medicine, just as it has always been. Domenico sends me away with the last two portions of chicken, which will store under oil for days, or weeks if I put them in a jar. As we drive home, I can feel them slosh and sway in the olive oil as we pass the hill of olive oil pots.After cooking, you can reuse the now deliciously flavoured oil to cook more chicken or make roast potatoes – simply filter through a sieve then keep it in a jar in the fridge as use as needed. Refrigerated, it will last for months.4 chicken legs, approx 220g eachSalt and pepperSmall bunches thyme and sage2 lemons1 orange8 garlic cloves, peeled2 inches root ginger, unpeeled, cut into thick slices.800ml extra-virgin olive oil or an olive oilvegetable oil mixThe day before, carefully and generously season the chicken, rubbing salt and pepper all over the legs, paying particular attention to the flesh near the bone. Put in a container, cover and leave in the fridge overnight.Pull the chicken from the fridge an hour before cooking. Choose an ovenproof dish or casserole large enough to accommodate the legs in a single layer. In the bottom of the dish, make a bed of the herbs, the pared zest of the lemon and orange (a peeler is best) the garlic and ginger. Lay the chicken on top, skin-side up and pour over the oil, which should submerge all but the very top skin of the chicken.Put in the middle shelf of the oven at 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4 for 20 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 140C (120C)275Fgas 1 for three hours.After cooking, let the chicken sit for at least an hour.

The Colchester captain knew the numbers of the top Premier League clubs and, as the draw for the Carabao Cup third round went on, none had come out. A measure of trepidation underpinned the excitement. “I was thinking: ‘What if it’s one of them? Say we get Man City away?” Prosser says. “They beat Burton 9-0 last season. You don’t want to get turned over silly.”Then it happened. League Two Colchester, who had beaten Crystal Palace on penalties at Selhurst Park, came out first and they were swiftly followed by Tottenham. For Prosser, a former Spurs youth player and lifelong supporter of the club, the surge of emotion was indescribable. This was the jackpot.“I couldn’t believe it,” the centre-half says. “My phone started going mad. My family are Spurs through and through and they were all going mad on our WhatsApp group. And then, straight away, you’re thinking: ‘I’ve got to mark Harry Kane.’ That was one of the first things that went through my head.”It is unclear whether Prosser will face Kane at Colchester on Tuesnight as Mauricio Pochettino considers whether to rest the striker. But that is a detail in a much broader story. Ever since he left Spurs as a 16-year-old in 2004, having been overlooked for a YTS contract, Prosser has dreamed of getting on the pitch in a competitive game against them. At the age of 31 and as he closes in on 300 appearances for Football League clubs, it is finally on.Strangely, it almost happened straight away. Prosser was an 18-year-old trainee at Port Vale in 2006 when the club were drawn to face Spurs at White Hart Lane in the Carling Cup. He was yet to make his professional debut – that would come for Port Vale in 2008 – but Martin Foyle put him on the bench. Port Vale would lose 3-1 after extra time.“I knew I wasn’t going to get on,” Prosser says. “I had to warm up every 10 minutes just to make it feel like I was actually involved in the game. It was so surreal.”Prosser’s Spurs’ credentials are impeccable. His father, Kevin, took him to his first game at White Hart Lane as an eight-year-old – a Boxing Day win over Southampton – and he can even count Cliff Jones, the legendary Welsh winger from the club’s 1961 Double-winning team, as a family friend. Prosser grew up in Hertfordshire – two minutes from Jones’s house – and was close to Jones’s grandson Scott.“I’ve known Cliff all my life – he’s one of the nicest blokes,” Prosser says. “He met me in the tunnel at White Hart Lane before the Port Vale cup tie and we had a picture. He also wrote me a letter to say how proud he was, which he left in my place in the dressing room. I used to do Cliff’s soccer schools and I was best friends with Scott, growing up. Scott and his mum, Mandy, lived with Cliff.“We used to love going into Cliff’s trophy room at the house. We were just in awe, although as a young kid you don’t realise the full extent of what he achieved. When you’re with other people, they say ‘the Wales legend’ and compare him to Gareth Bale. And you’re thinking: ‘Really? Cliff?!’ He’s 84 and is in unbelievable shape but he always has been. On his soccer schools, he’d join in and take everyone on.”Prosser’s face lights with enthusiasm as he talks about Spurs. He remembers how he was taken to watch the first-team train, as part of his attendance at Jones’s soccer school, and being thrilled to get David Ginola’s autograph, although that paled when set against playing at White Hart Lane while on the club’s books. He still watches the team on TV as a fan and was distraught when they lost the Champions League final.Prosser was taken on when he was 10, having been scouted as he played at a soccer school run by Micky Hazard, another fomer Spurs favourite. “Gary Hooper, who went on to play for Celtic, was in my year and he was the one who you’d probably say has come out best, although he left when he was 14,” Prosser says. “He worked his way up through non-league at Grays. Jake Livermore was in the year below and Jamie O’Hara was in the year above. Charlie Sheringham was also in my year and his dad, Teddy, would always be at training so everyone would be buzzing at that.“Generally, everyone at my school would have supported Spurs so to play for them as a young kid was a fantastic feeling.”As with virtually every professional footballer, Prosser saw youth players who were better than him and, in his opinion, would surely go on to make the grade. They did not. Perhaps, it was because of their attitude, their unwillingness to make the sacrifices that were necessary.Prosser was never going to fall down on that front. He came to see the writing on the wall at Spurs when he did not “play up” for the under-17s and the rejection, while devastating, was grimly expected. But he got a deal at Port Vale almost immediately and he has built his career upon a remorseless work ethic, a determination to wring every last drop from his talent.There is an old-school edge to him, possibly because of his Port Vale apprenticeship, when he lived in digs with 10 other boys and, in his words, cleaned everything from senior players’ boots and the manager’s car to the whole stadium. There is a humility, too, which is evident when he talks about his younger sister, Abbie, who was a star of the women’s youth game. She was a part of the England Under-19 squad that won the European Championship in 2009 and finished as the runners-up in 2010.“It’s funny when the chauffeur pulls up and your sister gets in and goes off with England and I’m sitting there thinking: ‘Bloody hell, I’m at Port Vale here, where’s my life going?’” Prosser says, with a smile. “Abbie had a trial at Arsenal Ladies when she was little – she turned up in her Spurs kit – and she was signed within five minutes. But she ended up falling out of love with playing.”Prosser can draw on the experience of having faced Spurs in pre-season during his time at Southend, when it did not go well. They lost 6-0 at Roots Hall in 2012 and 4-0 at the Tottenham training centre in 2015. “Kane scored a hat-trick in the first game,” Prosser says. “I didn’t think it was my hardest game ever, like I was frightened to mark him, but he’s still come off with the match ball. They had Danny Rose, Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend, while in 2015, it was Roberto Soldado, Rose and Townsend again, Nabil Bentaleb.”Prosser is under no illusions as to the size of the challenge. Is there a script written for him?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5473a789eddd8d12c2e0de2f7a2caf7b4ab0220/65_87_2053_1232/master/2053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03a1a7c71901e756baed22d265e749df","title":"mark noble west ham manchester united upton park","story":"‘This is not a bear pit,” one of the Sky pundits said of West Ham’s new home on Sunday. “This is not the old Upton Park.” In geographical, architectural and atmospheric terms, no dispute there. But one man in the claret and blue performed against Manchester United as though he had made his way to work past the market stalls and the Boleyn pub on Green Street and stopped for pie and mash at Nathan’s before taking to the pitch with the hot breath of the crowd on his neck and the anthems of the home supporters shaking the old stands. And that player won the man of the match award.A couple of minutes before half-time, Mark Noble received the ball from Issa Diop outside the right-hand corner of the United penalty area. He could have played a quick pass down the line into the path of Andriy Yarmolenko. Instead, seeing that the Ukrainian forward was likely to run offside, he paused, feinted to turn and pass inside, turned back the other way before turning full circle, drawing defenders towards him. Then he played the simplest possible square ball to Felipe Anderson, unmarked on his left five yards away. The Brazilian’s instant straight pass found Yarmolenko, running across the face of the goal and squeezing a shot inside the left-hand post.Noble had spent five seconds on the ball. In that time he had seen and assessed the moving geometry of the 13 outfield players lying ahead of him. He had used a decade and a half of experience as a first-team player, as a leader and a thinker on the pitch. That little pass – so modest, so unostentatious, so right – opened the way to victory for his team. The win was sealed 40 minutes later when he tumbled over Ashley Young’s poorly timed challenge five or six yards outside the area. Aaron Cresswell, having skimmed the bar with a similar effort a few minutes earlier, stepped up to curl the free kick inside the right-hand post. West Ham, who lay 17th in the table at this time last year, are now fifth, under a captain who incarnates a set of values all too easy to ignore but around which any decent team must be constructed.How their opponents could have done with such a player. Instead they had Juan Mata, a player of similar function, greater gifts and bigger reputation who was able to make no comparable contribution. Wearing washed-out gold shirts, United performed much as we have seen them do over the years in pale grey or faded pink. More than an away-kit rethink, however, they require a player of real character to set the example that keeps the rest of them honest.Noble is such a player. He is 32 years old, a year older than Mata. He was 13 when he joined the youth scheme of his local club after his father decided that the journey from Beckton to Arsenal’s training ground was too far. The Gunners’ loss was the Hammers’ gain. At 15 Noble became the youngest player to appear in their reserve team. He made his first-team debut at 17 and at 18 he was playing in the Premier League. Since then he has made 470 senior appearances for the club.If you want to get an idea of his value, look at the list of managers under whom he has served: Alan Pardew, Alan Curbishley, Gianfranco Zola, Avram Grant, Sam Allardyce, Slaven Bilic, David Moyes and Manuel Pellegrini. Consider the variations in approach represented by that parade of contrasting characters, and think what qualities of flexibility and resilience as well as talent must have enabled Noble to survive as a first-choice player under each of them.He was selected to represent England at every level from under-16 to under-21, sometimes given the captaincy, but has never been awarded a senior cap. In that he evokes the memory of Billy Bonds, another West Ham idol noted for resolve and longevity. Bonds was physically bigger and stronger than Noble, a wing-half converted to central defence, but no more vital a pillar of the side than the younger man. Bonds was picked once for England while Ron Greenwood, formerly of West Ham, was in charge of the national side, but did not make it off the bench.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsThere is a line between being a very good player in the league and being an international, and maybe successive managers have been correct in deciding that Noble would not manage to cross it. If Paul Scholes, at his best in a similar inside-forward role, could not be accommodated, then what hope for a player whose creative gifts are not so exquisitely honed? Noble’s lack of ego would probably count against him at the very highest level, just as Ray Wilkins – a first-team captain from the age of 18 – was hobbled as an England player by the altruism that persuaded him to defer to players of lesser talent.What Noble does – what José Mourinho, finding a charming malapropism to describe Roberto Firmino after another of Sunday’s matches, called “horsework” – is unflashy and sometimes unpretty. Like Scholes, he can endanger his team with tackling that lacks the precision of a true defensive midfielder, and the card he received for a challenge on Aaron Wan-Bissaka with the score at 1-0 might easily have been red. But he stayed on the pitch, helping his team to confound those of us who believed that the move to Stratford under the triumvirate of David Sullivan, David Gold and Karren Brady would be the end of them. Not a player to worship, perhaps, but certainly one to cherish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eb9d92acfbca89d955720e148836bef33a97e45/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5b272438086f803d9671d2ada5ed1ba","title":"untitled goose game review a honking good time","story":"PC, Switch Panic IncHouse HousePlaying the role of a loud, waddling waterfowl trying to disrupt village life isn’t rocket science, but this puzzle-stealth hybrid is a delightIf you break Untitled Goose Game (which, for the purposes of this review is the game’s title, never mind that it is clearly not untitled) down to its base elements, you might describe it as a puzzle-stealth hybrid, a kind of bird-based Metal Gear Solid where you must accomplish small tasks while remaining undetected. This fails, however, to describe the true joy of Untitled Goose Game, which is simply this: you are an annoying goose.That detail, that context, changes Goose Game from a merely competent brain-teaser into something far more coherent and fulfilling. Where most stealth games deal in the stark intensities of violence and death, Goose Game instead lowers the stakes back into the realm of comedy and slapstick, and comes off all the better for it.As a goose, your goal is quite naturally to cause mischief and chaos around a quintessential English village by completing a to-do list of vaguely defined tasks, gradually unlocking access to more and more of the town as you go. The puzzle element largely comes from figuring out how to accomplish these goals (well, pranks) within the bounds of the game’s clockwork world, by eliciting varying reactions from villagers to your avian antics.You might notice, for instance, that the gardener bends his head to the earth when he replants some prized object, at which point you can nick his cap and make off with it – a crucial component to getting him to “wear his sun hat” instead. It’s not exactly rocket science, but it’s nonetheless superbly satisfying to work out how, exactly, a goose is supposed to “make someone buy back their own stuff” or “be awarded a flower” with nothing more than a beak and a very loud, annoying honk.Aesthetically speaking, every element of Goose Game has seemingly been crafted to put a smile on your face. The way the Goose waddles as you strut around never fails to delight the clear, deliberate notes of an allegro in perfect comedic sync with the action on screen brings to mind classic Looney Tunes cartoons and other farces. An extremely minimalist UI and a bold, chunky art style also lends the village a lovely sense of peace and serenity, a perfect stage for your naughty waterfowl to get into all kinds of silly hijinks.Only two or three hours long, Goose Game doesn’t overstay its welcome, though there is an expanded list of small mischiefs to accomplish post-credits, if you still wish to continue terrorising the innocent. Certainly not fowl, most definitely worth a gander, it’s a whimsical little game full of charm and joy and a wonderful experience for just about anyone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b357fe4a6ff8ca3247485a9fcb7c9c6bbb705af/0_218_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bca01e86a478306c3e4b92446802143","title":"how we met i told her i loved her in uzbek she had no idea what i was saying","story":"Sarah Heywood-Rakhimova, 30, and Akmal Rakhimov, 29, are actors and live in New York‘“She would come to my house to teach me English, and I would teach her Uzbek,” remembers Akmal. “But my motive,” says Sarah, “was to get as physically close as I could – so how do you turn a lesson into a date?” They ended up kissing.This wasn’t real life, but a scene they developed and performed as part of a theatre course in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 2009. Akmal was from Uzbekistan Sarah, from the US. Both had enrolled for three years at the renowned Ilkhom Theatre of Mark Weil.“Everything we felt chemically and emotionally was on stage for everyone to see,” says Sarah. “Our professor saw it, our classmates saw it. We were like, ‘We’re just kissing because it’s a sketch.’ But it was heated. It was very magnetic.”Akmal remembers her arriving at the start of the course. “She was all big eyes, in shock, just waving at everyone,” he says. He invited her for an ice-cream at the end of one day, but with neither able to communicate with the other, Sarah turned him down. “I didn’t even know how to appropriately say ‘no’,” she says. “Body language was different, gestures were different. Then the next time he asked was in December, and I said: ‘Yes’ – and that was the first spark of maybe something.”“I didn’t speak any English. I couldn’t even say ‘an ice-cream’,” says Akmal. It was awkward, says Sarah with a laugh. They spent about half an hour together, smiling at each other.She hadn’t been expecting to meet someone. “I was so focused on school I couldn’t fathom getting involved with someone. But there was something about Akmal that drew me in. He had this smouldering gaze and he was secretive, almost, very hard to read. I felt that in certain exercises he opened up and I was like: ‘How can I engage with this further?’” Akmal was similarly intrigued. “She was a person with huge freedom. Even though I didn’t understand most of the things she said, the way she spoke and communicated, she seemed like a free person, which I wanted to be.”A date to an old Soviet-era theme park in February was the moment, says Sarah, “we just knew we were connected beyond this sketch, and beyond language”. Her Russian was better by this point. “There was almost a language of our own developing,” she says. “We could intuitively understand each other, based on gazes, or touch, or a certain shift in mood.”She says she remembers not wanting the day to end. Akmal helped her with some grocery shopping, then invited her back to his place for supper. “He lived 45 minutes away and he still took me home at night. I remember getting out near the big bazaar and it was snowing and I just felt so safe for the first time in my five months there. It was a magical moment, it was like a fairytale.”One spring afternoon, she told him she loved him. He laughed – at her bad Russian, Sarah thought. “And then he said: ‘I’m laughing because I’ve told you so many times before, you just didn’t understand me. Of course I love you.’ It was a sublime moment, great joy.” “I had been telling her many times, in Uzbek,” he says. “I would talk to her and she would sit and listen, but she had no idea what I was saying. I was just talking about her eyes, her smile, and I would always say: ‘I love you.’”Sarah had promised her parents she would finish her degree in the US, and she gets tearful talking about leaving Akmal at the airport at the end of the theatre course (they had also been separated during the summers). “We had no idea how, but we just knew we’d be together,” she says. “But we didn’t end up seeing each other for 14 months.” They talked over Skype and by email. “Just waiting for that call, I couldn’t do anything,” says Akmal. “I couldn’t somehow feel complete.”Akmal was twice denied a visa to visit Sarah in the US, so they decided a fiance visa was their best chance. “We got secondhand rings at the bazaar,” says Sarah. “They had a little celebration for us at the theatre.” It took another seven months to get Akmal a visa, but in October 2014 he arrived in the US they got married that month.Sarah is Jewish Akmal is Muslim. Why has their relationship worked across countries and cultures? “I didn’t care about the cultural things,” says Akmal. “It just felt right and she was the right person.” Sarah says: “I remember being without him, it felt like I was missing a limb. We’d learned about each other in such intimate, subtle ways that we fuelled off of being together. Even apart, we maintained that.”Want to share your story?

But a few changes can help lift the burdenHuman beings are not built to endure prolonged periods of stress. If you want to see an extreme example of what it can do to a person, observe prime ministers as they enter and exit Downing Street. Before, fresh-faced, they simper for the cameras. Afterwards, they are gaunt, grey and lined. It is like watching an accelerated version of ageing, and a reminder of how stress corrodes the human body.The fact is, stress kills. Prolonged stress has been linked to heart disease, depression and diabetes. But how can you stay healthy when you are stressed? We asked some experts.The salty-sweet smack of snack foods is often the only thing that gets many of us through stressful times. But the crisps you inhale as a deadline looms will make you feel rotten in the long term.“When we’re overwhelmed, it’s easy to reach for a quick fix in the form of sugar-rich food and drink,” says Azmina Govindji, a registered dietitian and a member of the British Dietetic Association. “This gives you an instant spike in serotonin, the body’s feelgood chemical, but it won’t last – and neither will the fast rise in your blood glucose levels, which also gives you a temporary high.” Instead, opt for complex carbohydrates such as porridge or wholegrain bread, which will give you the energy you need to face a difficult day.Taking 10 minutes to eat lunch away from your desk will reduce stress levels and prevent unhealthy snacking. “Eat mindfully,” Govindji urges. “Get away from your desk, chew your food slowly and savour the flavours.”According to research from the American Psychological Association, a third of Americans reach for high-fat, high-calorie foods when stressed. “To avoid this, plan your meals to give you structure and control.” It is unrealistic to expect people to meal-prep during periods of high stress, but a very easy meal plan of porridge and berries for breakfast, a wholegrain sandwich for lunch and vegetable pasta or fish with potatoes and broccoli for dinner is achievable and healthy.Many of us are guilty of an all-or-nothing mentality when it comes to fitness. We hammer the gym hard before a holiday, but when life gets in the way, our fitness goes out of the window. However, exercise is a powerful natural stress-reliever that will flood your body with feelgood endorphins.To motivate yourself, the personal trainer Maiken Skoie Brustad advises you to “remember how good you feel after you train. After exercise, you’ll always feel better.”If you can’t afford to visit a gym, or have responsibilities that keep you at home, there are plenty of free home-based workouts that can be squeezed into a few minutes. “Write down a cardio circuit of five exercises – three high-intensity exercises, such as running on the spot or squat jumps, and then two ab exercises such as planks or crunches – stick a timer on for 45 seconds and do each exercise for two rounds.”Don’t feel guilty about taking time out to exercise. “You have to be strict with yourself,” Brustad says. “Say: ‘OK, on Tuesday I will clear an hour out of my schedule,’ and train no matter what. When you’re training, focus on why you’re there. It shouldn’t be a treat to give yourself time to train. It should be a necessary thing for healthy human beings.”It is not normal to exist in a state of perpetual stress. If you feel you are approaching burnout, your first port of call should be your GP. “We all have stress in our lives,” says Dr Zoe Norris, a GP, “but the definition of anxiety as a disease is different from stress.” If patients come to her complaining of stress, she will ask them whether they have been having palpitations, panic attacks or long-term sleep disturbances. These could all indicatebe indicators that they were struggling with an anxiety disorder.Even if your stress does not meet the clinical threshold for an anxiety disorder, it is a good idea to be mindful of your stress levels. “Almost every part of the body is affected by experiencing constant stress,” Norris warns. “We are not designed for it as humans.”Develop coping mechanisms. “Put into place protective factors to reduce the impact stress is having on you,” Norris says. Exercise, reading or socialising with friends are all levellers. “If you don’t have these coping mechanisms, what happens is that you develop bad coping mechanisms, such as drinking coffee to stay awake, then wine to help you sleep.”Some stress is unavoidable: a relative dying, for instance. But if your stress is work-related, Norris encourages her patients to speak to their boss. “If their employers aren’t accommodating, they may come to the conclusion they need to find somewhere else to work.”Stress is a trigger for self-destructive behaviour, such as smoking or drinking too much. “Lots of patients are keen on detoxes or Dry January, but sustained lifestyle changes are better in the long term.”When you are stressed, your sleep often suffers. But staying up late in order to tackle a growing to-do list is counterproductive. “If you are suffering from poor sleep, that will make your stress levels higher,” says Dr Guy Leschziner, a neurologist and the author of The Nocturnal Brain. “Getting as much sleep as possible when you’re feeling overwhelmed will help to manage your stress.”What about sleeping pills? “They’re a double-edged sword,” Leschziner says. He explains that they can be helpful as a short-term solution, when someone is under acute stress. “If your GP prescribes you a short course of sleeping tablets, for a maximum of two weeks, they can be helpful. People can get to a crunch point where they don’t sleep at all and they can end up in a nervous breakdown situation.” But you can’t rely on pills as a long-term solution to stress. “It’s easy to get on a slippery slope. It’s better to resolve your sleep issues by dealing with the underlying source of stress.” Cognitive behavioural therapy can also help address your anxiety and improve the quality of your sleep.“If you feel overwhelmed, it’s usually a combination of work and home-life factors,” says Andrew Kinder, an occupational psychologist and a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.Develop your support structures. “Look at your relationships,” says Kinder. “Who are your potential allies? It may be family or friends. When people open up, they’re often overwhelmed by how much support is available to them.”Problem-solving approaches will mitigate extreme stress. If you are worried about debt, for example, tackle it head-on. “Get out the brown envelopes, open them up, start talking with your creditor and negotiate. That will give you more hope than just sitting on it and knowing that it’s festering in the background.”We live in a society that fetishises overwork, whether it is the side hustle you balance on top of your full-time job or the toxic culture of presenteeism that increasingly blights British offices. “Ask yourself the question: what do you really care about?” suggests Prof Josh Cohen, the author of Not Working: Why We Have to Stop.Strip your workload down to the essentials. “Excessive workloads are one of the main sources of stress,” Cohen says. Many things that we do in the workplace to endear ourselves to our bosses or appear more proactive than our colleagues are basically pointless. “There’s so much that’s just window dressing, where you’re being seen to do something.” Stop doing that and your stress levels may reduce.To avoid burnout, remember you don’t have to spend every hour in productive or fruitful labour. Sometimes, it is good to just do nothing at all. “Resist a permanent state of task orientation. There are other dimensions of life, and selfhood, that are worth believing in. Reducing yourself to the sum of what you do and identifying yourself so fully with your work won’t do your work any good in the long term. You’ll just end up resenting it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54995ce91bee2973aaa3f23b52be4633a0f0a373/0_583_5577_3346/master/5577.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10c7cb06b9e4556d3ec2eb7200700053","title":"knitwear that blends seamlessly into the background in pictures","story":"Photographer Joseph Ford and knitting guru Nina Dodd have collaborated to create bespoke jumpers for people, humans and even fruit that are incorporated into their surroundings in painstaking detail.

It sounds simple, but when you want to impress, the temptation to overcomplicate food can leave you feeling overwhelmed and overworked. So how do you make food to remember, without breaking your back in the kitchen? The answer is to take inspiration from the French – not their haute cuisine, but their countryside cooking, which is just as tasty and a fraction of the effort. The secret is simply to use the best quality ingredients, which should be left to do the culinary talking for you. When the basics are really good, there’s not much more you need to do other than throwing them together.Chicken is a great example. If you buy a standard supermarket chicken, you have to cover it in herbs and spices or even marinate it overnight to get a decent flavour out of it. Get yourself a poulet de bresse, and it’s a whole different story. These birds have been bred in the same French province for centuries, they have loads of space to run around, and they’re encouraged to eat a varied diet. Because of all that, you can put it straight in the oven on a low heat for an hour, then take it out, cover it in salt, and put it back in on high for 15 minutes, and you’ve got a meal for four that tastes out of this world.If you’ve got really nice bull’s heart tomatoes, cucumber and some olive oil, it’s pretty easy to just mix it up into a great salad to go with it crap vegetables make crap salads, and then you need to make it more complicated to make it taste better, which is a false economy. French culinary sensibilities make solo dining low effort too. I remember sitting out one night in Portugal with a tin of Ortiz tuna and crusty bread, and I just spent the whole evening on my balcony eating that with some drinks. It was perfect – no mayonnaise necessary.Speaking of drinks, when it comes to cocktails the same rules apply. If you’ve got good quality Grey Goose Vodka, you don’t need to mask the taste with syrupy mixers. Rather, you should let the inherent quality of Grey Goose Vodka do the talking, using it as the perfect base for botanical and classic citrus flavours such as elderflower, lemon juice or lime juice, as they complement the vodka without overpowering it – both Le Grand Fizz and Paris to Pampelonne are cocktails that add something new to the vodka without distracting from its taste. Grey Goose cocktails are wonderfully versatile too. If you’re pairing with something sweet, an Espresso Martini with high-quality espresso will balance things out nicely.Going straight to suppliers gives your food a story as well, which makes for great dinner party conversation. Customers love it when we wax lyrical about where our produce comes from in my restaurants, and so will your dinner party guests. Around six years ago, I was Instagramming some fishermen in their boat, and they were telling me what fish they’d caught that morning, and the next day it was in my restaurant. People love to hear these sorts of anecdotes because they help them feel connected to the food, which is why “I got it from the supermarket” never quite cuts it when you’re entertaining at home. While you will probably have picked your vodka from the supermarket, with a brand like Grey Goose there’s still a story to tell. Grey Goose is made with only two ingredients: single-origin Picardie winter wheat and water from its natural limestone well – a true reflection of Grey Goose’s French sensibilities.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd32eb2b3b16569e035616d0ea89a510963c9809/0_284_5747_3448/master/5747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a19e00ba1d62bf60344cdeab06b57f","title":"send us your questions for john humphrys","story":"The Today presenter has asked his final question.

The road not taken. But these regrets are typically rooted in explicit choices and decisions we’ve made. Often, however, we regret things that we weren’t even aware were options – the roads we didn’t know about. This kind of regret is particularly pertinent when it comes to managing our money. Although we make dozens of choices with our money every single day, we are blind to the options we didn’t even consider.For instance, even if we’re prudent enough to put some money aside instead of spending it on items we hardly ever use, we typically just stick it into a savings account. Or we put it into bricks and mortar.

It didn’t help that when I met my future husband he was more clued up and I found it all a bit boring.Many kids still leave school without a clue now. As parents we took it on ourselves to explain things like budgeting, interest and credit to our daughter and that had the effect of making me make more of an effort.The other thing I’d tell myself is to start a pension sooner. I was in my late 30s when I took one out, but then we put all our money into getting on the property ladder, which I don’t regret. But I realise I should have invested a bit more for later in life now that I’m headed in that direction. I won’t be able to afford to retire early like my parents did, probably not at 65 either – but perhaps that’s not the worst thing.Trevor Levy, 55, financial adviser, LondonPensions seem a million miles away in your 20s and I was no different – even though I ended up working in the financial services industry. I was trying to get people to take out a pension but I didn’t have one of my own for a while. Now, I explain to people that pensions aren’t an older person’s thing. A pension is your long-term financial friend and I should have made friends sooner. People get obsessed by property but it’s about having a balanced set of options to cover all eventualities.Making money was seen as cool in the 1980s. Everyone was buying and trading shares. I didn’t know enough about it but I invested in a funeral firm. I thought: “There’s something that’s never going to run out of business” – but there was no plan and I didn’t hold them for very long. Everyone expected to make a quick buck in that era, but it doesn’t work like that. You need to take a long-term view and have a portfolio to spread the risk.Richard Southgate, 70, retired, MaestegOne piece of advice my dad gave me was: “Spend a bit, save a bit, make the devils wait a bit.” I didn’t quite heed my parents’ advice. There’s probably something in that. They knew stuff I didn’t. They were upper-working class and had to be careful with money.If I could do things again I’d have got on the housing ladder quicker. For my generation property has proved great value. Though obviously it’s much harder to get on the ladder these days.There was a tech boom a few years ago. I didn’t have a lot of money but I wanted to get in on it. I had a financial adviser and he said: “It’s too late, don’t bother.” I didn’t listen and lost a fair bit – so that was a salutary lesson. I have taken advice since and have done OK on the stock market. I learned to ride the ups and downs and take a long-term view. I use a technique known as pound cost averaging, which involves putting a few quid in each month, rather than investing a lump sum all at once. You can’t time the market – the ups and downs average out.Whatever your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

The funds involved were £400m owed by the UK for a decades-old tank sale. In return, the Iranian foreign minister said he was prepared to argue for Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release at an Iranian court.Zarif said the proposal remained on the table when Boris Johnson became foreign secretary, but his successor, Jeremy Hunt, abandoned it.“Jeremy started talking about ‘you’re asking for ransom’. And I said: ‘Come on, this is not something that I started. This is something that Philip started,’” Zarif said. “Jeremy started to play tough because he wanted to become prime minister and it didn’t work out for anybody.” Zarif said the release of funds would not have amounted to a ransom.“As the foreign minister I do not have a standing in an Iranian court on any issue of somebody who is an Iranian citizen,” Zarif said. Iran does not recognise dual nationality in cases of Iranian nationals.“I have a standing for any foreigner who is accused of spying. I have a standing when I say there is an exchange. That gives me a standing in a court. That gives me a way to intervene.”The foreign minister said the subject came up in a recent phone conversation with the current UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, but with no conclusion.Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran to visit family when she was arrested in April 2016.Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said: “Over the three and a half years Nazanin has been held, we have had many messages from Iranian authorities in private linking Nazanin’s imprisonment to the old arms debt. So I am glad that foreign minister Zarif has been so clear. Transparency has been a long time coming.”Ratcliffe has previously raised concerns about his wife’s mental health under harsh prison conditions, and expressed fears she could take her own life.“Of course this is not a dispute that Nazanin should have ever been tangled up in in the first place. But it is also extraordinary it has been allowed to last so long, and that the twists and turns of ministers’ actions have allowed it to get so much worse for Nazanin, and others taken, with us all just encouraged to quietly wait.”Zarif said Iran had also been in negotiations with the US mediated by Switzerland over a possible exchange of prisoners but those talks had also stalled. “There is a proposal on the table with the United States. We exchanged the names through the Swiss. So we are ready,” Zarif said.In the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Zarif said he would have offered an exchange to the Iranian courts, which he described as an exchange of court decisions.“Britain owes us that £400m for 40 years,” he told a group of reporters at the margins of the UN general assembly. “Nazanin is in prison based on a court decision. United Kingdom is supposed to give us money based on a court decision. Now they want us to reverse our court decision but they don’t want to implement their court decision. You see the irony?”As relations worsen with the west, Iran has stepped up arrests of dual nationals and foreign visitors. This month, it emerged that two British-Australian dual nationals and an Australian had been detained.One of the detainees, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, is a British-Australian lecturer at the University of Melbourne and has been held at the notorious Evin prison in Tehran for almost a year.Another British-Australian woman, Jolie King, and her Australian boyfriend, Mark Firkin, have been held for the past 10 weeks. They were detained in Iran while on a trip around the world that they had been recording on social media.British ministerial sources accepted there had been an agreement in principle between the Treasury and the Foreign Office for the payment to be made to the Iranians in line with the court judgment, but said the payment would probably have been made in the form of delivery of medicines.The proposal met fierce resistance from the then defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, who pointed out a payment of £400m to the Iranian defence ministry at a time when the US was trying to squeeze the flow of funds to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards was not politically feasible.One ministerial source said: “What Iran has done with Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is unconscionable, and she deserves to be released under Iranian law. But it is also true that Britain owes a debt to Iran under international law, and if we are ever to build a relationship of trust with Iran, this payment has to be made and it would be wise to do so. There is no reason for the payment of this debt to be linked to the release, even if it clearly is in the Iranians’ minds.”Suggestions by Zarif that Hunt refused to make the payment because of his Conservative leadership ambitions were dismissed by British officials as mischievous.Efforts within the UK government were continuing over the payment as recently as a few months ago, but even ministers knowledgeable about the case, and broadly sympathetic to the Iranian argument over the outstanding debt, have privately said it is politically impossible to make the payment in the current context.Richard Ratcliffe has flown to New York in an attempt to meet Zarif, who is there for the UN general assembly, and to launch a campaign called Families Alliance Against State Hostage Taking. The initiative includes other families of foreign and dual nationals held hostage in Iran.“I have often said in the media, governments have an obligation to protect,” he said. “And for all of us in situations of profound distrust, protection lies in the rule of law. If the UK upholds its international legal obligations, it is more likely Iran will uphold its obligations – including human rights.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/576c48c7a2df97278856f95f9ad93d420b20f9d4/0_148_4170_2502/master/4170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f46a732f1e266de7cfc9ffbe9bedfc00","title":"where did it all go wrong for david cameron","story":"As the former PM publishes his memoirs, Patrick Wintour tells Anushka Asthana that Cameron’s pursuit of austerity and decision to call an EU referendum sowed the seeds of his demise.

Hamilton finished fourth at Marina Bay, with Sebastian Vettel winning in front of his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc. The British driver suffered from the wrong strategy call by his Mercedes team but nonetheless acknowledged that Ferrari had made great steps forward in pace.Vettel won from third on the grid, passing Leclerc with an undercut through the pitstops. Hamilton, in second place, wanted to follow the undercut strategy but Mercedes instead left him out to go long. On worn tyres it cost him time and track position and with overtaking almost impossible at Singapore in similarly matched cars, once he had lost his place he was unable to come back.Crucially however the pace of the Ferraris was undeniable. Their strength on the high-speed circuits such as Spa and Monza was proved with wins at both meetings. But they have struggled all season through the type of slower corners that abound at Marina Bay. However they brought a comprehensive upgrade package to Singapore and found a remarkable improvement. Already boasting a straightline speed advantage, if they can repeat this performance they will present a formidable challenge.“Maybe they’ve had a good car all year and it just wasn’t working in the right window,” said Hamilton. “But clearly their car works really well everywhere now so it’s going to be very hard to beat them, particularly as they are so quick on the straights. We can’t compete with them on the straights at the moment.”Hamilton still enjoys a comfortable lead in the world championship. He is 65 points ahead of his teammate Valtteri Bottas and is 96 points clear of Leclerc, in third. There are six races remaining, worth a potential 156 points.Hamilton won eight of the first 12 races this season but has not scored a victory since the Hungarian Grand Prix, while Ferrari have won three in a row. The world champion was insistent that he would have to continue to pursue his sixth title without any complacency.“It’s got tighter and tighter as the season has gone on, we welcome that, but at the same time we’ve just got to be doing a better job,” he said. “We were doing such a great job at the beginning of the year and we have this gap, but the gap can easily go. I’m under no illusions, it’s not won yet.”He also emphasised that there would be no sudden step forward for Mercedes. Upgrades are planned but not expected immediately. “I don’t know how much is coming over the next races that we have,” he said. “These next few races are going to be tough.”Ferrari had to placate an angry Leclerc after their strategy cost him the lead but had worked admirably in their intent to secure a one-two. Hamilton had called for the undercut himself during the race but his team opted not to take it. Mercedes have been largely clinical in their execution but the world champion was adamant they had to refocus after Singapore.“We have won before with not the best car but it’s really how we deliver over the weekend,” he said. “At the moment Ferrari are delivering better in the operations area. Today I did enough in the race in the first stint to come out and lead but the whole processes didn’t work as well as it should do. So we’ve just got to re-huddle, get back together, work hard and move forwards.”The team principal Toto Wolff admitted Mercedes had let Hamilton down and that chief strategist James Vowles took responsibility. “There wasn’t a driver mistake, but a mistake in the strategy,” Wolff said. “James, with his wide shoulders, said: ‘I have fucked it up’. We had a package capable of pole, an opportunity to win, and we made too many mistakes this weekend, with too many opportunities lost. The mood in the team is one of annoyance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21218cfc07db8d000e1516902e3169ebb2ca2b58/0_21_4159_2496/master/4159.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68805a33a6d237fea5460d671858599e","title":"rugby world cup opening weekend","story":"The opening weekend of the tournament put officials in the spotlight and showed the value of tactical versatilityThe opening week of a Rugby World Cup is always a blur of first impressions and fast-changing perceptions but, by anyone’s standards, Japan has been something else. It is not the world’s biggest rugby tournament alone that has been widening visitors’ horizons, in a dizzying, delightful and occasionally disorientating few days.Such unfamiliarity may just go some way towards explaining why some teams have underperformed in their opening games. Aside from a slick-looking Wales, New Zealand and Ireland, the beneficiaries of a horribly poor display by Scotland, a number of teams have taken a little time to get going.Referees appear a little confused, too. In an era of easily-available screengrabs and instant social media comment, there is unprecedented scrutiny on them, making their job even harder. That said, it already feels as if this tournament will stand and fall on how effectively the officiating teams can police the offside line, monitor cynical off-the-ball obstruction and penalise blatant breakdown offences.In all three areas there have already been high-profile examples of crucial offences going unpunished. Australia’s Michael Hooper cleared out one ruck against Fiji from such a ridiculously illegal entry point he risked being reported under the trade descriptions act by every gate manufacturer in Asia. The All Blacks captain Kieran Read cynically taking out Pieter-Steph du Toit, Louis Picamoles transforming the course of the France v Argentina game from a clearly offside position … if it continues there will be total anarchy.Certain coaches and players are also adjusting quicker than others to the necessity of amending tactics in mid game when circumstances demand it. The All Blacks’ win over South Africa was a particular object lesson having found themselves in early trouble, pinned back by the Bok rush defence, New Zealand identified an alternative exit route and had turned the tables within the space of a few minutes. The artful kick-passes of Richie Mo’unga and the counterattacking of Beauden Barrett and Seru Reece from deep were the sign of a team thinking smarter than most under the cosh. Steve Hansen has not been involved in successive World Cup triumphs by accident.This is not to say South Africa were one-dimensional – their initial surge would have broken many teams – but it was a timely lesson to Handre Pollard and the Boks’ other on-field leaders that the landscape can change very rapidly. While the Boks did mount a valiant attempted fightback their early control proved much harder to replicate once the pace of the game increased. Their box-kicking game is fine as far it goes but territory and possession alone are no longer the only thing that decide international matches.Unless Eddie Jones’s England were deliberately holding back against Tonga, they also need to reflect on what did and did not work for them during their underwhelming opening fixture inside the Sapporo Dome on Sunday. Nullifying opponents defensively is all very well but against sides who tackle stoutly they need to vary their point of attack more widely, concede significantly fewer penalties and play slightly more with their heads up. As Wales demonstrated against Georgia it is never too early in any big tournament to execute precisely, handle surely and play deliberately to space, wherever it happens to be.Power, in short, will count for a lot at this World Cup – Scotland certainly need to rustle some up some more gainline presence from somewhere – but so will a certain flexibility of mindset. Only those squads who adjust rapidly to the unique challenges of this World Cup will prosper in the days and weeks ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1de65f7e0a2ce0a4a1190c923de773234683d26/100_97_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=decc53668ee7644224a123a40553d1c2","title":"wales first half blitz ensures win over georgia rugby world cup","story":"• One-sided half resulted in Wales leading 29-0 at half-time• Georgia fought back after interval and edged third-quarterWales had to replace their attack coach one week after arriving in Japan and responded with their highest score since November after surprising Georgia with the alacrity with which they moved the ball from the scrum and the line-out. The speed with which Wales moved the ball and the flat passes caught out the Six Nations aspirants who rallied to tie the second period.Georgia wanted a set-piece battle and duly got one. They conceded three tries in the opening 20 minutes, two from a scrum and the other from a line-out as Wales, playing their first match since Stephen Jones took charge of the attack, passed flat across the line and cut an accommodating defence with inside runs that caused difficulty where none should have existed.The first try came after two minutes. As the Georgian pack got stuck into a scrum, Wales released the ball quickly and the scrum-half Gareth Davies waited for the right option before finding Jonathan Davies with the flattest of passes and no defender laid a finger on the centre.Dan Biggar missed the conversion in front of the posts but kicked a penalty on the same line but 20 metres back before a second scrum undid Georgia. Josh Adams came inside from his wing to receive Biggar’s pass and linked with Gareth Davies who looked to have the pace to make it on the outside but cut back and was tackled. Justin Tipuric picked up and sold dummies to two lazy defenders around the fringes before sprinting away.A departing gift from Rob Howley who a week ago was still Wales’s attack coach or an immediate contribution by Jones? Georgia were clearly prepared for contact rather than support players darting into space and they were again caught out on 19 minutes when, from a line-out, Adams again came into the midfield untracked by the defence and ran in unopposed from 40 metres.Georgia did rally, although a scrum move they twice used that saw three backs line up behind each other came to nothing because the depth made it easy for Wales’s defence. The forwards Shalva Mamukashvili and Giorgi Tkhilaishvili indulged in a bout of interpassing that was sabotaged by a Gareth Davies knock-on, but Wales had 15 minutes of tackling practice ahead of their next match against Australia before ending the half with another set-piece try and with it a bonus point.Tipuric won the line-out, Gareth Davies lopped around Ken Owens and found Jonathan Davies who drew the defence before finding Liam Williams outside him. It took Wales to 29 points, more than the Six Nations champions had managed in a match this year with Georgia unable to get near to the orchestrator of their downfall, Gareth Davies.Wales’s aim after the break was not to concede a try but within two minutes of the restart, they were lining up under their own posts. The second of two Georgian driving mauls reached the line and Mamukashvili got the ball to ground. Wales responded with indignation, claiming they should have had a penalty try after their rolling maul was brought down by Jaba Bregvadze who two minutes after coming on as a replacement walked back off the field to the sin-bin.When Gareth Davies went off six minutes into the second period, rested for the bigger battles ahead, Wales lost impetus. There was also the humidity factor although Georgia, more alert in defence, were playing its renewed energy. They were up quicker in defence, more alert around the fringes and enjoyed a few attacking moments.Wales kept them at arm’s length and hit them on the counter-attack with 16 minutes to go, George North’s kick from 40 metres out chased by Tomas Williams. Georgia responded with a try of their own from a set-piece, indirectly. They forced a penalty out of Wales’s scrum, took it quickly and Levan Chilachava was driven over the line. North and Wales’s attack, had the final word when the player finished impressively for his 39th try in his country’s colours – one behind Gareth Thomas’ career mark – with replacement Leigh Halfpenny converting as the Six Nations champions triumphed 43-14."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/234cb9822811cf6308ceb1c281b864f9e9f31ceb/0_174_3422_2053/master/3422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daf34df6d064ae619a8e9a435e6d55bb","title":"wales v georgia rugby world cup live","story":"Wales flew out of the blocks and secured a first-half bonus point before their opponents rallied superbly to draw the second half 14-14And that’s all from me.

Here you are:Bookmark this - our guide to pools, fixtures, results and all that:Here is a different interview with Gatland, courtesy of Rugby World Cup Twitter:Gatland speaks to ITV’s Gabriel Clarke: “Good first half, a little bit messy in the second half, the ball was a bit slippery out there. Georgia made it pretty hard for us in the second half and defended a lot better. Overall, pretty pleased ... “Given the side we were up against, you’ve got to back yourself to go out and score some points. To concede two tries in the second half was a bit disappointing ... Australia is a massive game for us ... these players have worked incredibly hard. This is a World Cup, and we need to make sure we are primed and ready to go.”That match against Wales is on Sunday in Tokyo. The Wallabies have two days more than Wales to prepare after that win against Fiji on Saturday. That might be a factor but then again, Wales were able to change it up nice and early today and use their replacements with the match and bonus point already secured.Alun Wyn Jones, in video form:It’s full-time, confirmed by the WRU:Gareth Anscombe in the ITV studio: “It’s tough when you get off to a start like that.”Anscombe’s point, in fairness, is that Wales knew they’d won the match, and their intensity dropped a little as a result. That’s arguably unfair to Georgia though. They came out a different team after the break, and scored a couple of fine tries. The vast majority of teams would have struggled to contain a couple of their better attacks.Alun Wyn Jones, Wales captain: “We’re probably a bit disappointed with the second half, to be honest. It’s a good result but there is plenty to work on. We took our foot off the gas a bit.”All over. Wales were excellent in the first half and not so good in the second. Georgia shrugged off the prospect of a thrashing (29-0 down at half-time), and recovered well to draw the second half 14-14. The attacking combinations for Wales in the first half were extremely well-oiled, as was the set-piece. Basically every time they got a line-out they scored a try off first-phase ball. But then Georgia came roaring back into the match, and Wales failed to come up with the necessary resistance at times, when under serious pressure. It was an excellent game of rugby, and Pool D rivals Australia will have taken note of how well Wales played early on.78 min. BIG GEORGIA NORTH. I just made that up. Seriously though, it’s been a strong finish by Wales, after Georgia had by far the best of the third quarter. Definitely some things to work on in training for Gatland and his men. The second-half score update is 14-14. Respect to Georgia, they’ve done exceptionally well.BIG GEORGE NORTH! Sensational skill from Tomos Williams sets this up, who is already on the board with one try. Out on the right wing, Williams skips outside then inside, beats a couple of tacklers, and makes light of another attempted tackle, off-loading one-handed to North, who completes an excellent finish, stepping outside one defender, then smashing through a couple of others, and ing over. Before that, it was a very impressive chase by Tipuric that initially created the pressure on the Georgia defence.74 min: Abzhandadze puts in a very smart kick, testing replacement Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny, who came on a few moments ago. Wales manage to clear.73 min: Georgia are on the attack again. And they are winning the second half 14-7. Milton Haig, their Kiwi coach, looked thrilled by that last try, and he can be very proud of how they have performed in this second half. Gatland and his right-hand men, on the other hand, will be disappointed that the first-half performance has not been matched by the second. Hats off to Georgia, though, they have been excellent since the break, even with a yellow card thrown in.What a cracking score. The replacement, making his 50th appearance, finishes off a quite superb try by Georgia. There was a quick tap and go into the Welsh 22, and the ball was moved left towards the corner. Wales tried to scramble, but didn’t have the numbers to repel the very powerful Georgians who were massed near the try-line. Chilachava flops over and there is no mistake from Abzhandadze with the conversion.67 min: Thanks to Arran in Kazakhstan for the following email:“I agree that spelling their names can be bit perplexing, but as a frequent visitor to Georgia, I can assure you that the place and people are not. Had some great times in Tbilisi and the country in general. Get over there, combine some rugby with spot of tourism. You’ll not regret it.”Sounds like a good plan.Reverse commentators’ curse. After a quiet spell it’s another try for Wales. Beautiful kick by North, who sends it in-field from the right wing, in behind the Georgian defence. Tomos Williams out-sprints the cover and touches down. Meanwhile Biggar is off, Rhys Patchell is on.62 min: Wales are yet to register a single point in the second half. They won the match in the first, which was great. Georgia have been really good, in general, in the third quarter. Smart money must be on a couple more Welsh tries at least as their superior fitness starts to count.61 min: Georgia have also almost emptied their bench, with six virtually un-spellable replacements being made. They are also back to 15 men after that earlier yellow card for Bregvadze. Thank God for copy and paste.60 min: Into the final quarter, and Elliot Dee, Nicky Smith, Dillon Lewis, Ross Moriarty and Tomos Williams are all on for Wales now. 59 min: “It’s just not George’s night tonight,” says Williams, sympathising with the lack of ball that George North has enjoyed.58 min: Current second-half champions Georgia take it forward again, but a cheeky decoy runner leads to a scrum put-in for Wales right on their own 22.56 min: “I’m pretty confident Wales will win with a bonus point,” says Jamie Roberts, forgetting they already have a bonus point. We’ve all been there.55 min: Scrum penalty for Georgia now. Georgia, let’s not forget, are winning the second half 7-0.55 min: Pat Carey - thank you very much:“Mas i George North” would translate as “out to George North”, and would sound like massive. In Welsh the Adjective would follow the noun, so George North mawr (big).”54 min: Wales attack again, but Georgia aren’t having any of it, again. A strong counter-ruck near their own posts, and now hooker Ken Owens is flat on the floor with an injury. Jamie Roberts, on comms, is praying it’s not serious.51 min: Georgia at it again with some top-drawer defence. North gets a couple of yards of space but is tackled brilliantly and driven back by Lobzhanidze, the scrum-half, of all people. Georgia turn it over. This is a good contest, if you ignore the scoreboard.I expect a barrage of emails now for not calling him George North, or Big George North, or Massive George North.49 min: Modebadze, the winger, pulls off a superb interception with Wales threatening the try-line yet again. Then Georgia drill a clearing kick to touch. Excellent defence. The replacements meanwhile are coming thick and fast for Georgia as they search for a lifeline in this match.Bregvadze comes on, as a replacement. Then he goes off, for collapsing a rolling maul. Georgia have freshened up their whole front row, but immediately lose one of the replacements, and will be down to 14 men for 10 minutes. The ref tells Bregvadze he’s lucky it’s not a penalty try as he jogs off the park.46 min: Oof, nearly a beautiful fifth try for Wales. Biggar chips a lovely little kick to his right, full-back Williams es on to it and over the try-line, but it’s adjudged a knock-on. Or was it an earlier knock-on? It’s no try, anyway.“Should Wales not worry about peaking too soon? After a half like that the rest of the tournament can only be downhill. It’s a long tournament to keep playing at that level. (not being entirely serious)“I’m actually watching with commentary in Welsh, and I’m pretty sure the commentator mentioned “Massive George North”. Does massive mean something in Welsh, or is it one of those words borrowed from English, in which case English speakers have been underestimating the big lad.”Lovely score - good line-out, big shove over the line, and then a brilliant conversion by Abzhandadze. Wales will be disappointed to concede, but Georgia are no mugs and that try proves it.42 min: Georgia win the line-out and rumble over. TMO check. “Shall we check it, or shall I just give it?” asks the ref.41 min: ITV just showed a replay of Biggar accidentally head-butting George North during try celebrations in the first half. That was probably the worst thing that happened for Gatland’s men. Early doors in the second half, Georgia are on the attack again, having turned the ball over from the restart, and have a good attacking platform with a line-out five metres out.Here we go.Back in five.Wales have been excellent. Everything is working well. There is literally nothing to worry about if you are a Wales fan, right now. At this rate, they will trump Ireland, and be top of the Six Nations class after the first round of pool matches. They have scored four tries, so the winning bonus point is secure. Gatland and his coaches are off down the pub.It’s try-time! Again! Williams shows good composure to collect a bouncing pass from Davies with the try-line beckoning and es over. Wales had 10 minutes or so in their own half, got the ball back, and went and scored another try.38 min: A couple of minutes to go in this first half and we’ve seen some lovely rugby. Wales are playing with all the authority of, well, grand slam champions and a recent No 1-ranked side.36 min: Brian O’Riordan: “Since Jes Pinkerton’s very funny email about ‘Big’ George North, the Welsh flyer hasn’t touched the ball. Maybe Jez has a touch of the jinx about him?”For one thing, Brian, it was Pickering, not Pinkerton. But I think you knew that. Also, Big George North just touched the ball! I do accept you were correct at the time of writing.34 min: Wales are pinned back again, this time on the opposite side of the field. Georgia have a good attacking line-out - but they get it wrong, and Big George North fields the bouncing ball. They might be winning by 22 points, but Wales have had a few minutes on the back foot now.33 min: Anthony Pease on email:“Although it’s going to be no more than a standout performance in what’s shaping up to be an utter pasting, I like the cut of the Georgian full-back’s jib. Even if you discount his relative solidity under the many high-balls, he’s absolutely rocking that ‘tash.”Matiashvili, that is.31 min: Massive tackle by Navidi about seven metres from the Welsh line on Tkhilaishvili, who is a huge unit. BOOM. But Georgia spin it left, then right, Kveseladze knocks it on, and Wales have repelled their opponents, for now.“I’m not watching (so thanks for the mbm) but is the Georgia kit not a tad similar to our own lovely red ?”Sure, there is nothing wrong with red, let me be clear. I’ve always been a fan of the burgundywinemaroon shades though.Out on the pitch, there is some rugby going on. Georgia kick to the corner and Wales are having to answer some questions in defence.27 min: TMO has a look but no problem for Wales. Davies is off the hook because the ball went backwards off his hand. I think? Georgia look disappointed with that decision to say the least. On commentary they fancied it could well have been a yellow card. Good scenes for Georgia anyway, they are not going to roll over here.25 min: Georgia! Front-rower Mamukashvilli storms through the Welsh ranks and suddenly Wales are stretched, for the first time in the match. Gareth Davies might now be in a bit of trouble for slapping down an attempted pass by No 6 Tkhilaishvili inside the 22, on the right-hand side.Hang on, he already has."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5775bf2445c73af5d76b87b60084fff1154540c2/0_440_2856_1714/master/2856.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea28d3d1498ec4875a6dd776e4f2d4f1","title":"danny dyer who do you think you are","story":"The show lost the plot when the EastEnders star became royally related TV producers love crying celebrities. Whether it’s Halle Berry at the Oscars or Cheryl Tweedy on Piers Morgan’s Life Stories, famous tears are ratings gold. If they could broadcast a show where Gazza was forced to chop onions while watching Terms of Endearment, they would. And you’d watch. You’d demand looping gifs, follow-ups and escalations involving kittens. Sadly, they can’t do that. So they have to think of less obvious ways to jerk the tears. And Who Do You Think You Are? is a prime example of that.The premise is simple: get a famous person, with the help of local historians and genealogists, to research their family history in the hope of discovering something interesting. What they mainly discover is that people born in the 19th century are dead and then use this to unashamedly pull on the heartstrings of that week’s celebrity. The show may like to sell itself as a serious historical exercise, but really it’s just an excuse to see how many consumption-prone distant relatives it takes to make JK Rowling cry.Away from the easy tears, where the show really excels is when we are given a rare glimpse of the real human behind each week’s personality. On what other show would you get to see Rupert Everett exchange naughty jokes with his mother round her kitchen table? Or Nigella Lawson visit her grandfather’s beautiful north London home for the first time in 35 years? As well as these less obvious treats, the show has also produced many genuinely extraordinary moments, like when Larry Lamb met his long-lost American uncle and then called his mum so she could speak to the brother she never knew she had. Or when Alan Cumming found out his grandfather was killed playing a game of Russian roulette.The show’s most extraordinary episode however, involved Danny Dyer. It was, quite simply, the most joyous hour of television in the whole of 2016. The (ahem) crowning moment came when, sitting in the choir of Westminster Abbey, Dyer unravelled a family tree going from him, in 22 steps, all the way back to King Edward III. The look of bewildered disbelief on his face as Handel’s Zadok the Priest kicks in was the unassailable pinnacle of the entire show. But, at the risk of pissing on my own Coco Pops, this was also the precise moment that it jumped the shark.Danny Dyer’s 22x great grandfather is most definitely Edward III. But although 22 might not sound like a lot, the exponential nature of ancestry means that the medieval king is just one of millions of 22x great grandparents that Danny Dyer has. So considering that the population of England in 1400 – 23 years after Edward died – was roughly 2.5 million, it’s actually not surprising at all that he is a direct descendant. In fact, you probably are as well.Once you go back that far, the show’s premise becomes utterly meaningless, because everyone’s family tree looks the same. When you realise that, the entire concept of genealogy seems rather pointless, because now we all know who we are: Danny Dyer’s cousin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e82bb30b270d4e35c874ff019bb9dc6c823449/0_344_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=311cc98476589cc6aa3aff45ff4e444d","title":"friends at 25 the best episodes","story":"Joey’s hand twin, Rachel’s meat trifle, Ross’s luminous teeth ... as the most popular show on the planet hits 25, here are its most classic momentsTwenty-five years ago, a sitcom debuted on NBC. Starring a clutch of beautiful yet little-known starlets, the sitcom was envisioned as a line in the sand for young Generation X-ers. This was their show, discussing the things they wanted to hear about. It was vital. It was epochal. The sitcom was called Madman of the People, and it was cancelled after one season after reviews called it “impoverished” and “noxious”.However, the show that debuted one hour before Madman of the People was Friends – a sitcom that became so staggeringly popular it still qualifies as one of Netflix’s most watched shows. What better way to celebrate this anniversary than picking through all 236 Friends episodes to find the funniest 25?Season five’s double-length finale might be best known for yanking the RossRachel will theywon’t they thread until it all but snapped – it’s where they get drunk and get married – but don’t forget it’s also the one where Joey discovers his hand twin.The episode where Chandler and Monica announce their relationship to Monica’s parents and where Rachel makes a trifle with meat in it.Nobody in the world wants to watch Apple’s new series The Morning Show. But what if I told you it will reunite Jennifer Aniston with Reese Witherspoon, the woman who played her spoilt little sister Jill in Friends? Still no? Fair enough.After deciding to tell Ross about her feelings for him, Rachel is staggered to see that Ross has a new girlfriend and, in response, gets off with a terrible Italian man. Fun fact: this was the first episode of a new season, and the cast looked so dramatically different from the previous year the writers had to squeeze in an entire plot explaining why.The episode where Ross and Rachel stop baby Emma crying by explaining how sexually attracted they are to large buttocks (“You really do like big butts, don’t you? Oh, you beautiful little weirdo!”). Notable for being one of the only episodes where Ross thinks about other people.Where Monica almost blinds herself to the extent that she kisses the son of a man she used to go out with, and Chandler sits in a box.The plan was for NBC to run four episodes of four shows, all set during the same blackout. Mad About You complied. Madman of the People complied. Friends complied, resulting in the episode where Chandler gets trapped in an ATM with Jill Goodacre. Seinfeld did not comply. Seinfeld is the best.Ross tries to alter his body but too much, part one.Where Ross loses his girlfriend to her ex and he just stands there watching. My theory is that, had Friends been made in 2019, Ross would spend most of his time on Reddit. Maybe when the reunion happens.Ross is so creepy. Take this episode, where he uses his position of power to date a girl much younger than him. When the reunion happens, there will be an episode of Friends where Ross spends the whole time downvoting movie trailers with female leads.Not that there’s a theme here or anything, but this is the episode where Ross mansplains karate a lot then goes out of his way to truly frighten a couple of women to prove a point.A neighbour of the friends suddenly passes away and this moment manages to teach many of them important lessons about their lives. So, you know, at least his death wasn’t in vain.Frasier was better than Friends – don’t argue, it was – but this was Friends at its most Frasierest. Chandler and Monica are dating, and the rest of the gang all know to some degree, but they don’t know how much the others know. A beautifully-plotted episode that ends with Ross watching his sister have sex. Which is very Ross.Ross has a girlfriend he doesn’t love, but he tells her he loves her anyway because he is weak. He gives her the keys to his apartment then changes the locks because he is weak. Rachel wants to have sex with Ross because she is silly.The one where Phoebe is going out with Paul Rudd then kisses someone who isn’t Paul Rudd, because she wouldn’t know a good thing if it pushed her under a steamroller.This came two episodes before The One Where Everybody Finds Out and sees Joey flailing like mad to stop everyone else finding out about Chandler and Monica. It’s arguably one of Matt LeBlanc’s finest performances and therefore one of the episodes that got the spinoff Joey made, so therefore the worst episode of Friends. Also, Ross gets angry about a sandwich, because of course he does.By this point, more out of boredom than anything else, Joey and Rachel are together. This is the episode where Ross discovers the betrayal and has a minor nervous breakdown (“E is for how extremely normal I find it that you two are together!”). Looking back, it was a real shame that Friends ended a year before The Game was published. Ross would have loved that.In which Rachel asks Ross what his deepest sexual fantasy is and he replies that it’s a woman in a bikini from a film made for children to enjoy. God, Ross is the worst.Where Ross gets so protective about the area in a library that contains his doctoral dissertation that he pretty much flat-out becomes a vigilante to ensure it’s treated with adequate respect. Did I mention that Ross was the worst?Where Rachel starts dating someone who looks like Ross, acts like Ross and has a name that sounds similar to Ross.Eddie was the best character ever to appear on Friends, for having an abrasive streak that wasn’t usually present in the series. In this episode, Chandler throws Eddie out of the apartment after waking up to see him standing over him. He chooses to do this by gaslighting Eddie a nice reminder that, while Ross is the worst, Chandler is a pretty close second.One day, our ancestors will realise that people who had been stung by jellyfish liked to urinate all over themselves and they will trace it all back to this episode. It doesn’t even work. Trust me.Ross tries to alter his body but too much, part two. “Oh my God, you can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!”In which Ross opens the door to a woman to discuss the smells of different types of gas until she runs away in a fit of abject panic. Oh Ross, you genuinely troubled man.A truly great episode that manages to flit from comedy to heartbreak to romance with barely a change in gears. This episode is widely considered the best Friends episode of all time, and is apparently a favourite of David Schwimmer, possibly because it’s one of the only ones where Ross doesn’t look or act like a serial killer.What are your favourite moments from Friends?

For decades now, we’ve been conditioned to expect the worst from the ceremony. The patter would be hacky and ill-advised (hello Sofia Vergara on a rotating plinth). The jury would giddily fling awards at movie stars, however mediocre, who deigned to dip their toes into the low-rent world of television. Modern Family would win things. It’s usually such a mess.So last night was strange. For the most part, the awards went to people who actually deserved them. Fleabag won. Barry won. Succession won. Killing Eve won. Ben Whishaw won. Chernobyl won. All the shows you wanted to win, but assumed wouldn’t because they were slightly more challenging than the usual Emmys fare, all won.But let’s start with Game of Thrones, which stormed into the Emmys trailing dozens of nominations behind it, and very nearly came away empty-handed. Four of its stars were nominated for best supporting actress, and all of them lost to Ozark. Three directors were nominated for best direction, and all of them lost to Ozark. Peter Dinklage at least deserved his best dramatic supporting actor win, because he did more than anyone to root this dog’s dinner of a season in some form of humanity. But after a long night of sustained losses, Game of Thrones’ eventual best drama victory felt a little hollow.Much more deserved was all the attention won by Fleabag, which took home lead comedy actress (over Catherine O’Hara!), comedy writing, comedy directing and comedy series. A sweep like this – while once again hinting at the possibility that Emmy voters only watch one comedy a year – is a terrific achievement that is thoroughly deserved and just about validates this publication’s decision to write three separate headlines about Fleabag every single day. I’d question the directing award, because it won against a Barry episode that qualified as an actual work of art. But let’s not quibble too much. Today the world belongs to Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and I can’t wait to see what she does next.The success of Chernobyl continues to fascinate. Not because it doesn’t deserve the attention – my god, it deserves all the attention in the world – but because Craig Mazin won for his writing. Mazin, you’ll remember, wrote The Hangover. If Joker wins big at the Oscars next year, as is predicted, it’s odd to think that the two most critically acclaimed works of the year will have their roots in a film where Ed Helms drugs Mike Tyson’s tiger with Rohypnol.If nothing else, Bandersnatch’s win helped to classify what it actually was. It won best television movie, despite not being on television or being a movie. It’s useful to have this level of categorisation because, if interactive dramas really take off, it prevents the Emmys from having to create a category called Best Bandersnatch.This being the Emmys, there were snubs. Of course there were snubs. Pretty much any time The Marvellous Mrs Maisel wins anything, it’s a snub. This year its awards were confined to the supporting and guest comedy performer categories, with Alex Borstein and Tony Shaloub winning. But they did so at the expense of Henry Winkler, Stephen Root and Anthony Carrigan from Barry, and Fleabag’s Olivia Colman, GLOW’s Betty Gilpin and The Good Place’s D’Arcy Carden who wasn’t even nominated in the first place. For the most part, the Emmys did well this year. But man, when it gets things wrong it really gets things wrong.But, really, the night belonged to the giant back-handed compliment paid to Game of Thrones. Sure, you’re the biggest show of all time. Sure, you changed television forever. But never forget this: you’re no Ozark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5806303e8010f76ee2ddb54cc30fa77d87c57896/111_0_5115_3070/master/5115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc7fb359e01354c324e0199b252bcf87","title":"iran says uk flagged tanker seized in july is free to leave","story":"Stena Impero was dramatically seized on 19 July, sparking crisis in shipping in GulfThe British-flagged tanker seized by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards more than two months ago has been released, according to Iranian officials.“The legal process has finished and based on that the conditions for letting the oil tanker go free have been fulfilled and the oil tanker can move,” Ali Rabiei, Iran’s government spokesman, said on Monday, according to the official IRNA news agency.The Stena Impero’s Swedish owners are yet to confirm the vessel has been freed from the port city of Bandar Abbas, but had said on Sunday its release was imminent.The decision to release the vessel comes a day before a meeting between Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York.Analysts said the timing of the announcement could be aimed at generating some goodwill ahead of the international meeting in which the Islamic Republic is expected to face pressure over allegations it carried out or supported last week’s missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure.The boat was dramatically seized on 19 July as it passed through the strait of Hormuz after Iranian officials claimed it had infringed maritime regulations. Footage released by Iran showed Revolutionary Guards descending from a helicopter to take control of the ship and detain its 23 crew members.About two weeks earlier, British Royal Marines seized an Iranian supertanker off the coast of Gibraltar carrying 2.1m barrels of crude oil that UK authorities alleged was to be sold to Syria in breach of EU sanctions against Bashar al-Assad’s government. Iran has denied the Stena Impero’s impoundment was a tit-for-tat move.The takeover, which led the UK to advise its ships to temporarily avoid the strait of Hormuz, was part of a wave of sabotage attacks and seizures of ships over the past six months in and around the narrow waterway through which more than a quarter of the world’s oil supply passes.The US and Gulf states have blamed Iran for the incidents, including the alleged use of explosives against four oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May, suspicious fires on two tankers in the same area in June and the attempted seizure of a British vessel in July, allegedly by Iranian boats that were driven off by a Royal Navy warship.A Gibraltar court ordered the release of the Iranian vessel, then called Grace and since renamed Adrian Darya 1, on 18 August after receiving written assurances from Iran that it would not head to countries under EU sanctions.The Adrian Darya switched off its transported near the Syrian coast earlier this month. Satellite imagery of the ship analysed by the independent service TankerTrackers showed the vessel near the Syrian port of Tartus on Sunday, casting a thin shadow that suggested it could still be laden with oil.That would contradict assessments by the UK, which has said it believes the oil onboard the ship has been sold to Assad’s regime, as well as claims by Iranian officials that Adrian Darya’s cargo was sold to a private company in a ship-to-ship transfer.The Islamic republic’s oil exports have fallen from about 2m barrels per day in August 2018 to about 160,000 barrels a day after the US imposed sanctions in November.Washington is seeking to force Tehran to negotiate a new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 agreement from which Donald Trump unilaterally pulled out  in May last year.Trump said the deal, which traded curbs in Iran’s nuclear programme for relief from sanctions, needed to also address Iranian missile development, human rights abuses and sponsorship of proxies. Iran had been in full compliance with the agreement when it was breached by the US.The incidents in the strait of Hormuz have led the US to create the international maritime security construct, an alliance of countries including Bahrain, Australia and the UK, whose vessels are trying to deter Iranian intervention against oil tankers in the area.Saudi Arabia and the UAE have both signed up to the construct in the past week since the attack on Saudi oil facilities that the kingdom said involved Iranian-made weapons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3361439d402414a22deeea5a8d1fd9355c0b656b/643_834_2499_1499/master/2499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=615526c3abeb318056f257287cc11201","title":"israel boost for netanyahu as three arab politicians refuse to back rival","story":"Israeli president tasked with choosing candidate to form Israel’s next government after inconclusive electionBenjamin Netanyahu’s chances of being chosen to form Israel’s next government appear to have improved after three politicians from the country’s Arab minority made clear they would not endorse his rival.On Sunday, an alliance of Arab parliamentarians who largely represent Palestinian citizens of Israel announced they would endorse ex-military general Benny Gantz.Support from the Joint List, which won 13 seats in Tuesday’s polls and made the bloc the third-largest force in the 120-seat Knesset, put Gantz slightly in front of Netanyahu. He had 57 recommendations, two ahead of the incumbent prime minister.However, Israel’s president Reuven Rivlin, who is tasked after an election with picking a candidate to form a government, said on Monday morning that three Arab politicians from the Palestinian nationalist Balad party had abstained.He confirmed the recommendations from the Joint List would account for only 10 endorsements, putting Netanyahu ahead by one recommendation.The president said he had invited Netanyahu and Gantz to meet him for closed-door talks on Monday evening in a effort to break the deadlock that has thrown uncertainly over Israel’s political future.Rivlin, whose role is usually ceremonial, is not obliged to pick Netanyahu. He can choose any candidate he believes has the best chance of forming a government. Usually, the decision is clear, and often goes to the leader of the largest party, but the muddied election result has created an impasse.The president has also suggested that since neither Netanyahu or Gantz have a majority of 61 seats that they form a unity government together. Netanyahu has backed that idea, although he has been coy about who would lead. Gantz has ruled out serving with Netanyahu, who is facing the prospect of three corruption indictments.The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance.Case 1000\u0026nbspis an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne.Case 2000\u0026nbspis examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper.Case 3000\u0026nbspis an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\u0026nbspCase 4000, the most serious,\u0026nbspinvolves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.If they do not join together, the president has the power to choose either, who will then have up to six weeks to form a majority government. If that person fails, Rivlin could then ask a second candidate.That scenario played out in May after Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition following a similar election result. But rather than give the opposition a chance to forge a government, he instead pushed to dissolve the Knesset, triggering repeat elections and giving himself another chance.Many fear a third election will be called in the current stalemate continues. Israel’s apparent kingmaker, the far-right ultranationalist Avigdor Lieberman, has said he will not back either and also called for a unity government.Sunday’s endorsement of Gantz by Arab parties, while not giving him a clear lead, broke an almost-three-decade policy of not supporting an Israeli leader while the occupation in the Palestinians territories continues.The last time Arab parties backed a candidate was in 1992, when they  suported Yitzhak Rabin, who went on to sign the Oslo accords with the Palestinians. Palestinian citizens of Israel, or Arab Israelis, make up close to a fifth of the 9 million population.Leaders in the group made clear they were not backing Gantz, who led a devastating 2014 war on Gaza, but instead attempting to topple Netanyahu, whose election campaign focused on demonising Arab Palestinian citizens and who pushed for a law they say made them second-class citizens.“We have become illegitimate in Israeli politics in the Netanyahu era,” the leader of the Joint List, Ayman Odeh, told Rivlin when informing him of the endorsement. “We are this time recommending Benny Gantz to form the next government.”The prominent Arab parliament member Ahmad Tibi added: “History is done: we’ll do what is needed to bring down Netanyahu.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af328be58a9679163e8f59cca242479b9bbc9dc5/0_102_3406_2044/master/3406.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21aceee5de6e3ecaae915c3c2c02bbb7","title":"raoul wallenberg family of diplomat who saved hungarian jews","story":"Raoul Wallenberg is thought to have saved as many as 30,000 Jews but his descendants do not know how, when or why he diedSeventy-five years after the amateur Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg embarked on his desperate mission to rescue Budapest’s Jews, his descendants still do not know how, when or why he died.This week, they are travelling to Stockholm to demand the government finally does a bit more to help them find out.“I want specific answers to specific questions,” said Marie von Dardel-Dupuy, the niece of the young architect and businessman whose bold if haphazard humanitarian operation is thought to have saved the lives of as many as 30,000 Hungarian Jews as the second world war neared its end.Von Dardel-Dupuy, who lives in Switzerland, told the : “He was a great man who wasn’t afraid to do the impossible. He deserves for us to know what happened to him. His story is unfinished – the mystery must be resolved. There are still so many closed doors, and we must have help in opening them.”No formal, official announcement has ever been made about the fate of Wallenberg, often called Sweden’s Schindler, who has become an honorary citizen of four countries and the subject of countless books and films since vanishing in early 1945 into the the Soviet prison system, where he is presumed to have died.Together with historians, the diplomat’s closest family have for decades wrestled with Soviet, and subsequently Russian, authorities, who they are now certain have withheld crucial information and, at times, actively misled researchers.But they have also faced a largely inert Swedish government that, they say, has since the end of the war displayed an understandable but acutely frustrating reluctance to do anything to antagonise its powerful eastern near neighbour.Susanne Berger is an American historian who acted as consultant to the Swedish-Russian working group that investigated Wallenberg’s fate from 1995 to 2005 and has since founded a research initiative that bears his name.She said: “We know for sure that the Russian side has important information it hasn’t released. But Sweden does not push hard enough to obtain that material.” Berger will accompany Von Dardel-Dupuy to Stockholm on 25 September to meet foreign ministry officials and MPs. She said: “We understand the pressures: we know it has to act with circumspection. But it could do far more.”The former Swedish prime minister, Göran Persson (in office from 1996 to 2006) apologised unreservedly for his country’s inertia over the case in 2001, noting that as long as there was “no unequivocal evidence of what happened to Wallenberg – and this is still the case – it cannot be said he is dead”.But, Berger observed, in practice little has changed since then. She said Von Dardel-Dupuy would hand Swedish officials a letter formally asking them to submit an official request to Russian authorities for access to 10 key documents or files that researchers knew existed, and were “crucial to the investigation of Wallenberg’s fate”.Berger said the demand went to the heart of the current dispute with Swedish authorities. She said: “Rather than act itself, Sweden places the onus of finding the truth on the shoulders of researchers and Wallenberg’s family – when it is quite clear that without official support this will always be an impossible task.”Raoul Wallenberg was 31 when, in July 1944, he volunteered to travel as a diplomat to Hungary as part of a US-funded effort to protect the 200,000 Jews still living in Budapest. More than 400,000 outside the capital had already been transported to Nazi death camps.He recruited 350 volunteers, rented 32 safe houses covered by diplomatic immunity, organised vital supplies of food and clothing, and issued thousands of “letters of protection”, official-looking documents that had no legal authority but were widely accepted by Hungarian and German officials, often with the aid of a bribe.Just six months after he arrived, however, Wallenberg – a member of the wealthy Swedish family of industrialists and bankers – himself became a victim. Invited to the Soviet military HQ in eastern Hungary, he was arrested and taken to Moscow.His family have never received an official explanation for his detention, although suspicions he was also spying for the Americans, and his connections with some senior German politicians – he negotiated his humanitarian mission with, among others, Adolf Eichmann – have been suggested.Worse, his family do not know for sure what happened to him afterwards. In 1957, Moscow produced a document dated 17 July 1947. It was signed by the governor of the Lubyanka prison infirmary, claiming Wallenberg had died that night of a heart attack and that his body had been cremated.Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, however, Russian officials have also said – without evidence, and claiming variously that he was poisoned and shot – that the diplomat was summarily executed in 1947. Unconfirmed reports that Wallenberg was still alive continued to surface until the late 1980s.Over the decades, the uncertainty has taken its toll on Wallenberg’s family. His mother, Maj, and stepfather, Fredrik von Dardel (his father died before he was born), devoted the rest of their lives to trying to discover the fate of their son, finally killing themselves two days apart in 1979.Their son, Guy von Dardel, the diplomat’s late half-brother, a particle physicist who helped establish Cern, sat on numerous commissions and travelled more than 50 times to Moscow, examining what records he could and compiling a 50,000-page dossier – but without ever uncovering any conclusive proof.His daughters, Marie and Louise, now in their 60s, have also campaigned tirelessly, convinced the mystery could be solved within a year if Berger, her colleague Vadim Birstein and other Wallenberg experts had access to the relevant documents.Among the classified records to which the historians want access are Soviet files on Willy Rodel, a German diplomat and Soviet informer who shared a cell with Wallenberg, and files that could help explain four days between Wallenberg’s transfer from Lefortovo prison to Lubyanka when his whereabouts are unknown.The researchers are also keen to see Red army – as opposed to military counter-intelligence – files relating to Wallenberg, as well as interviews with the diplomat’s colleagues and Soviet intelligence reports on the wider Wallenberg family and its often controversial business interests.But their main interest, said Birstein, a historian who was a member of the first international commission on Wallenberg in 1990, is in the records of prisoner No 7, a still unidentified prisoner who they know was interrogated, together with Wallenberg’s driver, for more than 16 hours on 23 July 1947.If, as researchers firmly believe, prisoner No 7 was actually Wallenberg, that means the diplomat was still alive six days after his official date of death. “It’s absolutely unclear why they are still refusing to release this material,” said Birstein. “We know these records exist – so what do they have to hide?”After a formal request by Von Dardel-Dupuy in 2018, Sweden last month belatedly released 40,000 pages of its own Wallenberg archives dating mainly from 1970 to 2018 – meaning a total of 170,000 pages are now available in Stockholm.Margot Wallström, the foreign minister who has since resigned, said at the time that it was “important to keep Wallenberg’s memory alive”.She added: “His civic courage inspires us, and is much needed in today’s world. The government will continue to support the work of trying to get clarity on his destiny.”Berger said that was not really good enough. She said: “There’s a gulf between the words and the action. Seventy-five years after Raoul Wallenberg risked his life in Budapest, the question is no longer when the truth will be known, but why neither side seems to have the political will to reveal it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/234caad445c21daf82efebf03e67c323f3f7d740/0_143_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=094a6fa72a69f6b463bff20231456f95","title":"uk to snub franco german alliance for multilateralism","story":"UK decision not to send minister to first meeting of group is sign of how Brexit is shifting foreign policyBritish ministers are to snub a major new “alliance for multilateralism” being launched by France and Germany at the United Nations general assembly this week in a fresh sign of how Brexit is shifting British foreign policy.The alliance, due to be launched by the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, and the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, is intended to act as a bulwark against what Le Drian has described as “the wilding of the world” and the abandonment of the rules-based order set up after 1945. The initiative, in the planning for six months, has inevitably been seen as a thinly-veiled rebuke to the increasingly vocal advocates of national sovereignty such as Donald Trump.The alliance’s first meeting in New York on Thursday is due to be attended by over 50 ministers but Britain is not sending a minister, and has declined to sign five of the six declarations linked with the initiative.The alliance is regarded by France and Germany as its most important joint diplomatic response to nationalism, and the British refusal to embrace the plan underlines how much Brexit may lead to a wider parting of the ways between the UK and Europe.In the past in debates between advocates of national sovereignty and multilateralism, the UK has always sided with the multilateralists.Countries that have signed up to the agreement, according to Le Drian, include France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Singapore, Ghana and others. Le Drian made no mention of the UK. He said: “The symptoms of a true wilding of the world accumulates, putting in peril the multilateral edifice which we collectively developed, as we learned the lessons of two great world wars.”The aim he said “was to give a voice to the immense majority of countries that believe in the efficiency of international cooperation”. Calling the alliance an ambitious humanist project for the 21st century designed “to fight those that are destroying the international order”, Le Drian said the multilateral structures built after the second world war did not threaten national sovereignty. Instead, he said such structures were “a collective guarantee and protection against the law of the strongest, including basic humanitarian law that protects civilians in time of war. Multilateralism is both a method and a goal. In a word multilateralism is humanism.”Confirming the British ministerial absence from the launch on Thursday, a French government spokesman said the alliance was never intended to be a membership group with formal participation but instead an organisation for cooperation.He said the UK supported one of the six initiatives, which are headed: call for trust and security in cyberspace, international partnership for information and democracy, joint position of the group of friends on climate and security, education equality at the centre initiative and finally, 11 principles on lethal autonomous weapons systems.The move came in the wake of the US president cutting funding for the United Nations, withdrawing from the UN human rights council, Unesco and the Paris climate agreement.Le Drian and Maas stressed that their initiative was not directed against the US, and Maas added that he would be happy to see the United States join the effort.“Whoever wants to join us can join us – it is against nobody,” said Mass.Critics on the left claim the plan is in fact primarily in France and Germany’s national interests since they are the great beneficiaries of the status quo, and so are reluctant to reform institutions to allow currently marginalised nations a greater stake. Others have criticised the plan for being too vague, or duplicatory of the UN’s work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40ce3b3569053c62100adbd4c94940ff29736329/0_120_4856_2913/master/4856.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37280a4b57e678e8fcfb334c0525e16a","title":"westminster council accused using pride london march cash cow","story":"Figures reveal organisers charged more than £150,000 in three years because it is not classed as a political marchWestminster council has been accused of applying “double standards” by charging organisers of London’s annual Pride march more than £150,000 over three years to host the event.This summer, about 30,000 people from more than 600 groups took part in the parade celebrating LGBT communities, which was attended by an estimated 1.5 million people.Figures from Westminster council obtained by the  showed it charged organisers £166,146 to stage the event over the past three years. The bulk of the charges were made up of a £103,378 fee for the suspension of parking bays, a sum that had risen from £29,304 in 2017 to £44,526 this summer.It is understood the council charges fees for events it classes as “parades”, but does not for political marches. Campaign groups have argued that Pride is a protest not a party, and have criticised organisers for allowing the event to lose its political message and become too commercialised.More than 230 businesses took part in this year’s parade, compared with 217 charities and just 37 community groups. This year’s sponsors included Tesco, Amazon, Barclays and Facebook.The human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: “Westminster council exploits Pride as a cash cow. It slaps the organisers with charges that are not applied to NHS, anti-austerity and people’s vote marches. Why the double standards?”The figures, which were released following a freedom of information request, show that when the costs of council officer time and cleaning for the parade route are taken into account, Pride had a net cost to the council of £165,664 over the past three years.“We work closely with Pride in London every year, heavily subsidising events over the weekend and only recovering a portion of costs towards the significant work that goes into running a fun, safe, and successful Pride.”Alison Camps, the co-chair of Pride in London, said organisers worked with the council to make the event a success, “from street trading licences and park hire, through to the thorough clean-up operation afterwards”.“The council waives a number of costs each year, which we appreciate, meaning Pride has to pay around half of the total fees,” she said.“As one of London’s largest annual events, we work with all of our partners to make sure we meet our budgets and get the best possible value for money. The savings we make go towards improving the event and making Pride a safe, fun and accessible space for all to enjoy.”Notting Hill carnival, which also attracts more than a million people every August, is given a yearly grant of £175,000 by Kensington and Chelsea council. The local authority said it spent more than £700,000 on the event annually."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f14022c8340f239f5a9c4707be4cb9c08eb02f1c/0_150_4808_2885/master/4808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92234f28180e2aa6ec6cf9a5ef939557","title":"what is the point of the un general assembly","story":"As its 74th session looms, we examine the annual meeting where world leaders get their 15 minutes in the spotlightThe UN general assembly is the world’s parliament, where all the UN’s 193 member states are represented. Each sovereign state gets one vote so it is not exactly representative of the world’s population but then again, its votes are not binding on the membership, except in budgetary matters.The general assembly is not nearly as powerful as the security council, which can pass binding resolutions, and is dominated by the five permanent members, the US, China, the UK, France and Russia, who each have a veto.But the general assembly can express world opinion, make recommendations to the security council and elect the council’s non-permanent members. The 74th session takes place this month.The general assembly and the security council are two of six main organs of the UN. They sit alongside the secretariat (the general secretary, António Guterres’, office), the international court of justice (seated in The Hague), the economic and social council (a policy coordination body) and the trusteeship council.The only time the world really pays heed to its great talking shop is the week commencing 23 September, when the high-level general debate takes place at its customary moment in the annual diplomatic calendar.The world’s leaders converge on New York, where each is given an (unenforced) time limit of 15 minutes to speak in front of the green marble podium and orate in front of the world. Leaders occupy positions in the hall in alphabetical order by country name, usually with a different nation occupying the first seat each year.In truth, the general assembly week usually makes news in the first day or two, when the US president and other powerful heads of state tend to have their moment, and then attention tends to tail off.For that reason, there is always some horse trading before the general assembly week, with prime ministers from big countries trying to swap speaking slots with presidents of small countries.The general assembly is also the preferred venue for America’s great antagonists to land a few blows while on US soil. Nikita Khrushchev, Hugo Chávez and Muammar Gaddafi all had a go at this. Gaddafi unleashed a 90-minute diatribe in 2009 but that was pithy compared to Fidel Castro’s record 269 minutes in 1960.More recently, Binyamin Netanyahu made headlines in 2012 by bringing visual aids to illustrate his allegations against Iran, one of them a cartoon bomb.Good question. It is more about posturing than policy but there are summit meetings on critical subjects. Barack Obama chaired a meeting on nuclear proliferation at his first general assembly in 2009.This year, there is a climate action summit on the eve of the general debate, attended by the teen activist, Greta Thunberg. Putting the climate emergency centre stage and forcing states to do something are two very distinct things, however.Not a lot, it has to be said. A large section of east midtown Manhattan is closed to traffic and roads outside the zone are frequently blocked to allow for the motorcades criss-crossing the area. The sidewalks are filled with people in suits with collections of passes around their necks arguing with police about which entrances they can use.It is good news for midtown hoteliers, however. They are booked up months in advance. The power centre during general assembly week used to be the Waldorf Astoria, where the US ambassador’s residence was situated in a penthouse suite. It is also where the US would host many of its meetings in the margins of the general assembly. But the US moved out after the hotel was bought by the Chinese insurance group, Anbang.One visitor tried to break with the routine of luxury hotels. When he attended in 2009, Gadaffi tried to pitch an enormous tent in the town of Bedford, 45 miles north of New York, until the locals complained. The owner of the site said he had no previous knowledge of Gaddafi’s camping intentions. The landlord’s name: Donald Trump.The big question this year, like last year and the year before that, is who is going to meet whom on the sidelines of the assembly. In that way it has the same compelling appeal as a dating show, watching two people who plainly hate each other try to find something in common. This year, like last year, there was some early anticipation of a meeting between Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani. That started off unlikely and has veered towards the near impossible following last week’s attacks on Saudi oil installations.Trump and Rouhani both face resistance within their own governments to any form of reconciliation. There would have to be a significant easing of sanctions for Rouhani to agree to a Trump meeting on the sidelines of the general assembly but there are few signs that Trump would be willing to do this.Trump might be keen to spring a surprise encounter, to generate some positive headlines, but that is not how Tehran operates. Rouhani is still being criticised in Iran for taking a phone call from Barack Obama as Rouhani was leaving UNGA in 2013, without checking in first with Iran’s supreme leader.Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro was expected to make his UNGA debut, to defend his policies against the near consensus view that they are destroying the Amazon. But his attendance is in doubt in the wake of surgery for a hernia caused by a knife attack during the campaign a year ago. He has vowed to show up, even if confined to a wheelchair. It is a unique opportunity to grab the global spotlight. By an accident of UN history, it is traditional for the Brazilian head of state to be the first world leader to talk at UNGA, on the first morning while everyone is still paying attention. Bolsonaro’s doctors however, may take a different view.Boris Johnson might welcome his general assembly appearance as a ersion from domestic woes. A second meeting with Trump is likely as both men have an interest in not looking isolated on the world stage. Face time with a US president is always an objective for most visiting leaders, to show their electorates their importance on the world stage.The circumstances of such an encounter can also be important. In 2009, the then UK prime minister, Gordon Brown, was desperate for even a brief meeting with Barack Obama. The meeting finally happened but under humiliating circumstances. Brown got a “walk and talk” with Obama in the UN kitchens. As Obama strode past the pots and pans and gas ovens, Brown had to try to keep up and talk, out of sight of the world’s cameras.Trump could try to achieve something on his stalled North Korea talks at this general assembly, either some progress with the Pyongyang regime, or a meeting of security council powers, in a bid to fix the holes in sanctions enforcement and put the screws back on.Trump’s speech is expected to focus on global religious freedom, and he could well refer to the current US priorities at the UN, fighting abortion rights around the world and for a conservative stance on gender issues.Some leaders might not bother with the general assembly at all. Vladimir Putin is a regular no-show. The Russian president tends to come only once a decade and the last time was in 2015.A bigger question is whether Venezuela’s beleaguered president, Nicolás Maduro, will turn up. He came at the last moment in 2018, but this year, with the US and its allies no longer recognising him as head of state and accusing his regime of numerous crimes, his presence in New York, even as the theoretically protected guest of the UN, would be a much more risky endeavour.Although it is the UN secretary general who gets the limelight for most of the year, the event gives the president of the general assembly, elected each year by the member states ahead of general debate, a chance to shine.This year it is Nigeria’s Tijjani Muhammad-Bande. After the initial excitement of greeting the world leaders, however, it is rather a thankless task, introducing each leader to the assembly and then sitting through one speech after another, most of them turgid and self-congratulatory.This is the world’s biggest summit and it attracts a lot of side events because of the proximity and potential participation of world leaders. The most glittering of these events is the Goalkeepers conference run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, where celebrities, activists and politicians will talkbout global inequality."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4027670.1569250147!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach says government to phase out oil exploration off irish coast","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: ‘disappointing’ that US president Donald Trump not attending UN climate summit in New York. File Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe Government is to phase out oil exploration off the coast of Ireland, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has announced.Speaking ahead of Monday’s climate summit in New York, Mr Varadkar said that a decision had been made to stop oil exploration off the coast of Ireland, though gas exploration will be continued.Standing alongside Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton, the Taoiseach said the Government had received advice from the Climate Advisory Council which has recommend to change the policy when it comes to exploration.“Recognising that we end exploration for oil in Irish waters, we will continue to explore for natural gas given that it’s a transition fuel that we are going to need for the next few decades, as new technologies are developed and deployed.”He said Ireland would be one of the few countries in the world to make the decision to start phasing out exploration for oil, because of its commitments to achieve carbon neutrality. He also noted that the decision was made on the basis of scientific advice from the advisory council which is chaired by Professor John Fitzgerald. His comments come after the Government announced it would be ring-fencing funding from a carbon tax for climate policies.“Any extra money raised from carbon tax will be ploughed back into climate action”, he said, including retrofitting, renewable energy and greener farming.Mr Varadkar will address the climate summit later on Monday.He also said he was disappointed that US president Donald Trump will not attend the summit.Instead the US president is addressing a conference on religious freedom, also in the UN complex.“I think it’s disappointing that President Trump isn’t attending the climate conference today… it would be better if the president of America, the country the world looks to for leadership, attended what is the most important event of the day,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4026356.1569171178!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"un climate summit six big issues facing world leaders","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t The latest scientific evidence suggests the worst predicted effects of global heating are happening quicker than anticipated. Photograph: Luis RobayoAFPGetty Images1 It’s happening quicker than anticipated – the Paris Agreement may not be enoughThe worst predictions are coming through quicker than anyone feared. Many scientists now believe the Paris Agreement which bid to keep the temperature rise 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels will not do.Global leaders are now asked to do more when they meet in New York . Targets agreed in 2015 must be delivered by all by 2020, as pledged. But more must be done, and decisions must be made about who pays.2 The gap between promises and reality is huge The terrible reality is that most countries are behind on their Paris promises. Global emissions continue to rise, fossil fuels are still the main sources of energy. Some progressive countries, notably in the EU, are decarbonising their economies with some success. However, Ireland is not amongst them due mainly to transport and agriculture emissions.Emissions must stop rising by 2020, scientists now believe if we are to have a good chance of limiting warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees. However, emissions may not peak until 2030, even if countries fully implement promises already made.3 The dark shadow over global efforts: the USThe US walked away from pledges made in Paris. Now the Trump administration is actively hampering global efforts to decarbonise. In fact, it is encouraging more fossil fuel use in the US, while easing environmental regulations that will help fossil fuels drive the economy for years to come.What’s more, the role played by the US and EU ahead of Paris that unlocked pledges from China – now the world’s biggest emitter – has been absent under Trump, who is a climate change denier.4 The big money shift – it’s happening, but not fast enough Trillions of euros are needed in coming decades to back green energy supplies, to pay for efforts to cut back on energy use and to pay for the costs of damage that cannot be reversed.Huge sums are needed, but so, too, are rules and checks. The developed world created most of the problem, and must do more to fix it. Despite Trump, change is happening. If he is not re-elected in 2020, expect that leadership to be provided quickly.5 Responsibility must fall where it shouldSome countries are more to blame than others. The G20 countries – the world’s wealthiest nations – produce 80 per cent of emissions. In fact, just 100 companies have produced 70 per cent of all greenhouse emissions since 1988.Iniduals can say, “it’s not my fault” if they want. But every emission matters. Every day matters. There is a moral imperative on everyone of every rank to act.Everything is interlinked – the ecological crisis is connected to climate change and species decline, which is connected to a capitalist system that seeks never-ending economic growth.Put simply, fossil fuels destroy forests, which in turn adds to global heating and wildlife destruction. Consequently, global temperatures increase, ice sheets melt and seas rise.Solutions are not easy. There are no quick fixes. But some wins are easier than others. Wind and solar power is accelerating sales of EVs will dramatically accelerate over the next decade. The cost of storage batteries is falling.Most importantly, more people understand the need for change, especially the young. Even big business now realise that climate action is good for profits and shareholder returns. It was late in coming, but welcome. Ironically, it is politicians and governments who have been slowest to change.How is mankind affecting the global climate and what can be done about it?"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoiseach dismisses reports the State will come under EU pressure to compromiseSwedish teenage activist addresses UN climate summit in New YorkVaradkar says action being taken following advice from Climate Advisory CouncilPrelate intervenes after latest search for Columba McVeigh ends without successGarda\u0026iacute say juvenile male found \u0026lsquohiding\u0026rsquo near scene, second suspect still at largeGovernment warns those still driving with UK licences they could face prosecutionMother-of-two Anne O\u0026rsquoNeill (51) found with head injuries in a garden in October 2017Conservationists estimate thousands of creatures killed in destruction of parcel of wetland\u0026lsquoIt\u0026rsquos what you\u0026rsquod expect after a natural disaster, not an ordinary Monday,\u0026rsquo says INMOYouth stole mother\u0026rsquos car and was pursued, finally colliding with armed response vehicleFour people were in Cabra property at time of attack, garda\u0026iacute sayOwner of Co Cork shop that sold winning lotto ticket \u0026lsquoover the moon\u0026rsquoEx junior minister lost her Cork North Central seat in 2016 general electionIncident happened at Tinnycahill, Clar at about 8pm on Sunday nightCountries urged to increase ambition to tackle emission at action summitDetectives believe same gang behind three incidents in four nights in Cork and KerryAnti-immigrant activists trying to dominate and exploit local debates on direct provisionBlaze at Matt Talbot centre in Ballyfermot has curtailed support programmesFunding sought for scheme that will not require offenders to talk about crime"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4026623.1569169797!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd is this the big one for crooked donald","story":"US president Donald Trump claims he did not say anything wrong during a telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart in which, according to reports, he pressed for an investigation into Joe Biden and his son.

The One that’s going to finally bring Donald Trump down.As soon as the news broke Wednesday night in the Washington Post that a whistleblower had accused the president of making some sort of nefarious “promise” during a call to a foreign leader, the hive erupted.Democrats haven’t been able to get Trump on paying off a porn star to protect his campaign. They haven’t been able to get him on being a Russian agent. They haven’t been able to get him on obstruction of justice. But maybe this time. Maybe this was the One where all would decide that they wanted impeachment, that the president’s behaviour was so outrageous that they couldn’t imagine this sleazy business guy sitting in the Oval Office playing a tinpot dictator in a tinfoil hat for another second.Maybe this was the One that would finally move Republicans to turn on the Grendel who is terrorising the village and gulping down their party. Certainly, Trump himself didn’t think so. As the capital was going into overdrive-freak-out mode Friday night trying to flesh out the whistleblower story, the president was busy tweeting about a children’s book by a Fox News host: “Buy this Book – great for the kids!”WhistleblowerIf House Democrats can ever get their paws on the whistleblower, maybe they can make up for the judiciary committee’s performance with Corey Lewandowski this past week, which left many wondering if these hearings designed to pry Trump out of office are just making Democrats look foolish.They certainly provide an ample platform for Trump loyalists to rail against their favourite deep state foils. When failed presidential candidate Eric Swalwell tried to get Lewandowski to read a message Trump had dictated to him, the witness nastily referred to the Democrat as “President Swalwell” and told him to read the message himself.The internecine strains between the impeach-now Nadler crowd and the get-him-out-in-2020 Pelosi crew grew more bitter. Politico reported that in a closed-door meeting, House speaker Nancy Pelosi shocked lawmakers and aides by harshly criticising the House judiciary committee staffers for propelling the impeachment effort far beyond where the Democratic caucus stands. “And you can feel free to leak this,” Pelosi said acidly.In an interview with NPR, she said she hadn’t changed her mind on impeachment, but she does think Congress should pass new laws so future presidents can be indicted. She said everyone had now seen what the founding fathers could not imagine: a president blatantly abusing the constitution he has sworn to protect.Above the lawTrump has certainly been working hard to prove Pelosi right that presidents should not ever be above the law. By Friday night, while Trump was readying for a state dinner with his ultraconservative pal from down under, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times were reporting that the secret whistleblower complaint involved this: Trump repeatedly pressured President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine – about eight times, the Journal said – to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s loony personal lawyer, to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.Giuliani has been pushing a story about the former vice-president and his son, who had ties to a Ukrainian oligarch. After a fair bit of babbling on Chris Cuomo’s CNN show, Giuliani spit out some truth, that he asked Ukrainians to look into the Bidens.Later he tweeted: “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.” Crooked Donald thinks he can create a Crooked Joe narrative just like he created a Crooked Hillary one. Which is it, Donald: Crooked or Sleepy?Escaped the nooseSo just consider this: Around the same time that Trump escaped the noose after Robert Mueller’s tepid testimony, sliding away from charges that he colluded with a foreign country to interfere in our election, he began arm-twisting another foreign country to interfere in our election. “Questions have emerged,” the Times said, “about whether Mr Trump’s push for an inquiry into the Bidens was behind a weeks-long White House hold on military aid for Ukraine.The United States suspended the military aid to Ukraine in early July, according to a former American official. So the president is under suspicion of making like Nixon and abusing power to go after his enemies, saying it would be a shame if anything happened to that military aid that you want because you don’t dig up some dirt on the son of my political rival.Pelosi’s acerbic statementThe administration kept the whistleblower’s complaint from Congress, even though Congress has the legal authority to know what this urgent complaint is about. Pelosi issued an acerbic statement on Friday, noting that Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, was violating the law by refusing to disclose the complaint to Congress.“If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she said. Trump is literally acting like an international mobster. Roy Cohn would be so proud. So is this the Big One? We don’t know because so much has come before. But if it is? Now that would be big.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Labour will introduce \u0026#39four-day working week,\u0026#39 Shadow Chancellor pledges Monday afternoon news briefing: Thomas Cook holidays turn into nightmaresOperation Matterhorn: Everything Thomas Cook customers abroad need to know  Comment: As Remainers take control, even \u0026#39dead cats\u0026#39 won\u0026#39t help an outfoxed Jeremy CorbynBrexit latest news: Jeremy Corbyn faces defeat in conference vote as Unison says Labour must become the party of RemainSummer-born children are more likely to suffer depression in childhood, study reveals for first timeThomas Cook collapse: \u0026#39We found out our holiday was cancelled on Twitter\u0026#39Russia ratifies Paris climate accord - but targets are \u0026#39critically insufficient\u0026#39Spanish police arrest nine Catalan independence activists on suspicion of plotting violent acts with explosivesIndonesian skies glow blood red from forest fires and toxic hazeRoyal Tour 2019: A guide to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s South Africa itineraryCCTV boss and employee jailed over Emiliano Sala mortuary footage as  judge blasts their \u0026#39morbid curiosity\u0026#39Comment: Labour\u0026#39s private schools crusade is a dogmatic assault on freedom\tFour flashpoints to watch for at the UN General AssemblyWomen react better in disasters than men because men are more likely to go to the window and watch, study findsGreen tea may hold the answer to rise of drug-resistant superbugsComment: After the last referendum, do Labour Remainers really want Jeremy Corbyn on their side?\tComment: America\u0026#39s Cold War with China could spark an \u0026#39Archduke Franz Ferdinand moment\u0026#39 in IranAutumn Equinox 2019: The science behind the changing seasonsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/21/TELEMMGLPICT000210085974_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0gmupraKUR1Zcu4RcaNG-VEQ.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"inside charity gala justin trudeau shocked 500 guests blackface","story":"The shock \u0026#39didn\u0026#39t register\u0026#39 with Mr Trudeau, pictured at the party in 2001On the evening of Feb 24, 2001 Justin Trudeau breezed into the palatial Fairmont hotel overlooking Vancouver harbour for a charity gala.It was supposed to be a formal event with an Arabian Nights theme including belly dancers and Middle Eastern music.Some 500 guests showed up, the men in tuxedos.

For hundreds of thousands of others, who were yet to travel with the company, the only remaining option is to claim their money back.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut for Thomas Cook’s 21,000 employees, the end of the line for Britain’s oldest travel firm means something much worse: the loss of their jobs. That is usually the outcome of the type of the insolvency procedure used to wind up the company – a compulsory liquidation.\u0026nbsp“Generally on a compulsory liquidation, with some exceptions, staff unfortunately lose their jobs as the business quickly ceases trading,” explains Emma Shipp, partner at law firm Hewitsons.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBusiness and economics editor Olesya Dmitracova has the full story:\u0026nbspWhat now for Thomas Cook\u0027s 21,000 staffBillions of euros in revenues supporting millions of jobs are at risk from the “seismic” impact of a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit, Europe’s car makers have said.As the UK hurtles towards the 31 October Brexit deadline with little sign of a new deal, bodies representing the industry united to issue a joint plea to avert a no-deal. Such an outcome, they said, would have an “immediate and devastating” impact on one of the continent’s most successful sectors and employer for 13.8 million people across the EU.“The UK’s departure from the EU without a deal would trigger a seismic shift in trading conditions, with billions of euros of tariffs threatening to impact consumer choice and affordability on both sides of the Channel,” a group of 21 national trade associations, along with a number of Europe-wide bodies, wrote in a statement today.No-deal Brexit will have \u0027seismic\u0027 effect on millions of car industry jobs, say manufacturers\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLabour’s embrace of Universal Basic Services “can renew social contract”, say academics\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s latest plans for the economy show a clear commitment to enhancing the living standards of millions in an increasingly insecure economic climate, say a group of experts at the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College London.\u0026nbspThe academics and economists praised John McDonnell\u0027s pledges to massively expand the provision of social housing\u0026nbspfree bus travel, meal provision for those most at risk of food insecurity and basic phone and internet access.\u0026nbspThey said the cost of the policy - around £42bn - could be entirely funded through changes to the Personal Allowance on income tax.\u0026nbspProfessor Henrietta Moore, Director of the UCL Institute for Global Prosperity, said:Adopting the Institute for Global Prosperity’s vision for Universal Basic Services as policy represents a major step forward in renewing the social contract in the UK. It shows a clear commitment to enhancing the living standards of millions in an increasingly insecure economic climate.Our ideas around UBS were developed in response to the changing realities of the modern economy. The livelihoods and life chances of millions of people are coming under increasing threat from rising costs for housing, food and other essentials. At the same time, too many are faced with insecure work, low pay and the prospect that their jobs and whole industries could disappear due to automation and technological change. Simply carrying on as we have before will not alter these trends.UBS provides an affordable way for us to meet these challenges, providing an enhanced safety net that can simultaneously provide the foundations for full participation in our economy and stem the rampant inequality that’s eating away at our society. To operate effectively, we have outlined how it must go hand-in-hand with democratic accountability at local level. UBS must be an expression of our shared social needs, with communities themselves in control.Labour pledges 32-hour working week\u0026nbspThe UK would move from being one of Europe\u0027s most overworked nations to being one with the most leisure time, under plans unveiled by shadow chancellor John McDonnell.\u0026nbspHe told the Labour Party conference that, if elected, his party would reduce the average full-time working week to 32 hours with no loss of pay within a decade.\u0026nbspA new Working Time Commission would be handed the power to recommend increases in annual statutory leave requirements while a Real Living Wage of at least £10 an hour would be introduced.\u0026nbsp“We should work to live, not live to work,”\u0026nbspMr McDonnell said.\u0026nbspLabour would also restore powers to trade unions on day one, he added.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s political editor Andrew Woodcock has the full story:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLabour commits to 32-hour working week within a decade\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThomas Cook collapse latest\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor (a firm which specialises in corporate restructuring), has commented on today\u0027s news.\u0026nbspMs Palmer noted that a number of factors contributed to the collapse, such as Brexit and the rise of online bookings, but said the company\u0027s management strategy\u0026nbspcould have played a role in its demise.\u0026nbspShe said:\u0026nbsp“Questions do have to be asked of the management’s strategy. Other competitors, such as Tui, have faced similar issues yet have weathered this storm and developed a more compelling product offering.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Unfortunately, the Thomas Cook model was heavily based on a legacy model of high street travel agencies combined with a lacklustre online offering.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“But whatever the reasons for Thomas Cook’s demise, the UK travel industry will be reeling for some time with the loss of one of its most respected and historic names.”\u0026nbspTo follow all the latest updates on Thomas Cook\u0027s collapse, head over to our dedicated live blog:\u0026nbspMike Ashley in yet another takeover bid\u0026nbspMike Ashley appears to have an insatiable appetite for takeover deals - despite swoops for House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and Sofa, as well as interest in HMV and Patisserie Valerie, the retail mogul has launched a big for Goals Soccer Centres.\u0026nbspSports Direct, the jewel in the crown of Ashley\u0027s ever-expanding retail empire, revealed today that it put forward a 5p-a-share approach for Goals\u0026nbspon 5 September.\u0026nbspSports Direct already owns 18.9 per cent of Goals, which recently uncovered improper behaviour with its accounts dating back to 2010.\u0026nbspGoals has not yet allowed Sports Direct to look at its books.\u0027Dreadful\u0027 data from Germany\u0026nbspClaus Vistesen, Chief Eurozone Economist Pantheon Macroeconomics, has issued a damning assessment of the problem\u0027s facing Germany.\u0026nbspAnother dreadful set of PMI data from the Eurozone’s largest economy, Vistesen says.\u0026nbspThe contraction in manufacturing worsened with the PMI sliding to a gruelling 41.4, from 43.5 in August, and what’s worse, the services index also weakened, to 52.5 from 54.8 last month. Many analysts will use this as justification for evidence that the manufacturing recession is spreading into the rest of the economy, but the problem is that the services PMI is an unreliable indicator for such a shift.\u0026nbspIt often exhibits large swings for no reason whatsoever. That said, we don’t want to stand in the way of the main story here. These headlines are ugly, and more-or-less confirm that the German economy entered recession in Q2 and Q3. Uncertainty over global trade, and the tariff stand-off between China and the US, are now driving a deterioration in German manufacturing, which is as bad as during the 2008 crash.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWeWork\u0027s biggest investor seeks to oust controversial CEO Neumann\u0026nbspAdam Neumann\u0027s time in charge of WeWork could be drawing to a close as the firm\u0027s biggest investor reportedly draws up plans to oust him.\u0026nbspWeWork\u0027s much-hyped stock market flotation was put on hold earlier this month after receiving little interest from investors worried about an inflated price, questionable business model and unusual corporate governance arrangements.\u0026nbspJapan\u0027s SoftBank, is now looking for ways to get rid of Neumann, Reuters reported, citing\u0026nbspfour people familiar with the matter.Softbank ploughed millions into WeWork at a sky-high valuation of $47bn in January.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThis would result in higher car prices for consumers because manufacturers will not be able to absorb all of the extra costs, the group said.The car industry is one of the most deeply integrated across Europe, meaning it faces some of the biggest disruptions of any sector as companies with sites in the UK are forced to adapt to the new reality of tariffs and delays caused by border checks and additional administrative tasks.Across the EU, one in 16 of the workforce is employed in the car industry, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Within the UK, close to a million people are employed in the sector or in jobs supported by it, a number of which are at risk from the impact of\u0026nbspBrexit.\u0026nbspInvestment by carmakers has plummeted from an average of £2.5bn to £2.7bn over the past seven years to just £90m in the first six months of 2019.Car industry workers want to leave the EUWhile the UK is expected to be hit hardest by a disorderly exit from the EU, manufacturers across the English Channel are not immune either.“Brexit is not just a British problem,” said Christian Peugeot, president of the French automotive trade body\u0026nbspCCFA. “We are all concerned in the European automotive industry and even further.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For hundreds of thousands of others, who were yet to travel with the company, the only remaining option is to claim their money back.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut for Thomas Cook’s 21,000 employees, the end of the line for Britain’s oldest travel firm means something much worse: the loss of their jobs. That is usually the outcome of the type of the insolvency procedure used to wind up the company – a compulsory liquidation.\u0026nbsp“Generally on a compulsory liquidation, with some exceptions, staff unfortunately lose their jobs as the business quickly ceases trading,” explains Emma Shipp, partner at law firm Hewitsons.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBusiness and economics editor Olesya Dmitracova has the full story:\u0026nbspWhat now for Thomas Cook\u0027s 21,000 staffBillions of euros in revenues supporting millions of jobs are at risk from the “seismic” impact of a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit, Europe’s car makers have said.As the UK hurtles towards the 31 October Brexit deadline with little sign of a new deal, bodies representing the industry united to issue a joint plea to avert a no-deal. Such an outcome, they said, would have an “immediate and devastating” impact on one of the continent’s most successful sectors and employer for 13.8 million people across the EU.“The UK’s departure from the EU without a deal would trigger a seismic shift in trading conditions, with billions of euros of tariffs threatening to impact consumer choice and affordability on both sides of the Channel,” a group of 21 national trade associations, along with a number of Europe-wide bodies, wrote in a statement today.No-deal Brexit will have \u0027seismic\u0027 effect on millions of car industry jobs, say manufacturers\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLabour’s embrace of Universal Basic Services “can renew social contract”, say academics\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s latest plans for the economy show a clear commitment to enhancing the living standards of millions in an increasingly insecure economic climate, say a group of experts at the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College London.\u0026nbspThe academics and economists praised John McDonnell\u0027s pledges to massively expand the provision of social housing\u0026nbspfree bus travel, meal provision for those most at risk of food insecurity and basic phone and internet access.\u0026nbspThey said the cost of the policy - around £42bn - could be entirely funded through changes to the Personal Allowance on income tax.\u0026nbspProfessor Henrietta Moore, Director of the UCL Institute for Global Prosperity, said:Adopting the Institute for Global Prosperity’s vision for Universal Basic Services as policy represents a major step forward in renewing the social contract in the UK. It shows a clear commitment to enhancing the living standards of millions in an increasingly insecure economic climate.Our ideas around UBS were developed in response to the changing realities of the modern economy. The livelihoods and life chances of millions of people are coming under increasing threat from rising costs for housing, food and other essentials. At the same time, too many are faced with insecure work, low pay and the prospect that their jobs and whole industries could disappear due to automation and technological change. Simply carrying on as we have before will not alter these trends.UBS provides an affordable way for us to meet these challenges, providing an enhanced safety net that can simultaneously provide the foundations for full participation in our economy and stem the rampant inequality that’s eating away at our society. To operate effectively, we have outlined how it must go hand-in-hand with democratic accountability at local level. UBS must be an expression of our shared social needs, with communities themselves in control.Labour pledges 32-hour working week\u0026nbspThe UK would move from being one of Europe\u0027s most overworked nations to being one with the most leisure time, under plans unveiled by shadow chancellor John McDonnell.\u0026nbspHe told the Labour Party conference that, if elected, his party would reduce the average full-time working week to 32 hours with no loss of pay within a decade.\u0026nbspA new Working Time Commission would be handed the power to recommend increases in annual statutory leave requirements while a Real Living Wage of at least £10 an hour would be introduced.\u0026nbsp“We should work to live, not live to work,”\u0026nbspMr McDonnell said.\u0026nbspLabour would also restore powers to trade unions on day one, he added.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s political editor Andrew Woodcock has the full story:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLabour commits to 32-hour working week within a decade\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThomas Cook collapse latest\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor (a firm which specialises in corporate restructuring), has commented on today\u0027s news.\u0026nbspMs Palmer noted that a number of factors contributed to the collapse, such as Brexit and the rise of online bookings, but said the company\u0027s management strategy\u0026nbspcould have played a role in its demise.\u0026nbspShe said:\u0026nbsp“Questions do have to be asked of the management’s strategy. Other competitors, such as Tui, have faced similar issues yet have weathered this storm and developed a more compelling product offering.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Unfortunately, the Thomas Cook model was heavily based on a legacy model of high street travel agencies combined with a lacklustre online offering.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“But whatever the reasons for Thomas Cook’s demise, the UK travel industry will be reeling for some time with the loss of one of its most respected and historic names.”\u0026nbspTo follow all the latest updates on Thomas Cook\u0027s collapse, head over to our dedicated live blog:\u0026nbspMike Ashley in yet another takeover bid\u0026nbspMike Ashley appears to have an insatiable appetite for takeover deals - despite swoops for House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and Sofa, as well as interest in HMV and Patisserie Valerie, the retail mogul has launched a big for Goals Soccer Centres.\u0026nbspSports Direct, the jewel in the crown of Ashley\u0027s ever-expanding retail empire, revealed today that it put forward a 5p-a-share approach for Goals\u0026nbspon 5 September.\u0026nbspSports Direct already owns 18.9 per cent of Goals, which recently uncovered improper behaviour with its accounts dating back to 2010.\u0026nbspGoals has not yet allowed Sports Direct to look at its books.\u0027Dreadful\u0027 data from Germany\u0026nbspClaus Vistesen, Chief Eurozone Economist Pantheon Macroeconomics, has issued a damning assessment of the problem\u0027s facing Germany.\u0026nbspAnother dreadful set of PMI data from the Eurozone’s largest economy, Vistesen says.\u0026nbspThe contraction in manufacturing worsened with the PMI sliding to a gruelling 41.4, from 43.5 in August, and what’s worse, the services index also weakened, to 52.5 from 54.8 last month. Many analysts will use this as justification for evidence that the manufacturing recession is spreading into the rest of the economy, but the problem is that the services PMI is an unreliable indicator for such a shift.\u0026nbspIt often exhibits large swings for no reason whatsoever. That said, we don’t want to stand in the way of the main story here. These headlines are ugly, and more-or-less confirm that the German economy entered recession in Q2 and Q3. Uncertainty over global trade, and the tariff stand-off between China and the US, are now driving a deterioration in German manufacturing, which is as bad as during the 2008 crash.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWeWork\u0027s biggest investor seeks to oust controversial CEO Neumann\u0026nbspAdam Neumann\u0027s time in charge of WeWork could be drawing to a close as the firm\u0027s biggest investor reportedly draws up plans to oust him.\u0026nbspWeWork\u0027s much-hyped stock market flotation was put on hold earlier this month after receiving little interest from investors worried about an inflated price, questionable business model and unusual corporate governance arrangements.\u0026nbspJapan\u0027s SoftBank, is now looking for ways to get rid of Neumann, Reuters reported, citing\u0026nbspfour people familiar with the matter.Softbank ploughed millions into WeWork at a sky-high valuation of $47bn in January.

Instead, Labour needs to make sure that private schools are not an attractive option for parents when compared to a brilliant system of state education.”However, shadow chancellor John McDonnell argued scrapping private school fees could boost the economy.He told BBC Radio 5Live: “What I think we’ll find is that for the large number of people who would be, at the moment, spending money on private education, that money actually will go into the wider economy and stimulate the economy.”Both the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and Mr Corbyn attended private schools.On Sunday, Mr Corbyn tweeted: “Every child deserves to get the very best education, no matter their background.

These qubits make use of a quantum phenomena known as superposition, meaning they exist in two states at once.The ability to act as both a ‘one’ and a ‘zero’ at the same time,\u0026nbspquantum computing systems are theoretically able to be exponentially more powerful than classical computers with every qubit added.This exponential rate was called into question earlier this year by computer scientists at Google’s quantum computing lab, who observed that their systems were gaining power at a “doubly exponential” rate.IBM plans computers millions of times faster than any beforeHarmut Neven, director of Google’s Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, told\u0026nbspQuanta\u0026nbspmagazine in June that their most advanced quantum processor was improving at a rate far beyond what they thought was theoretically possible.Mr Neven said that such a rate of development was almost unfathomable, as there is nothing that grows that quickly in the natural world with which to draw a comparison.“It looks like nothing is happening, nothing is happening, and then whoops, suddenly you’re in a different world,” he said.The Independent\u0026nbsphas reached out to Google for comment on the leaked research paper.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement.

HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHThe Bad Seeds frontman then revealed that the second part consists of two long songs, linked by a spoken word piece:He concluded the announcement with: The songs on the first album are the children. The songs on the second album are their parents.\u0026nbspGhosteen\u0026nbspis a migrating spirit.

Months ago, that was the date that a college student typed into a joke Facebook event, before writing the words that would go on to make it become a day of angst for the US military and residents who live near Area 51.Next to that date, a bored young man called Matty Roberts writes an event description that would propel the page to viral fame.“Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us,” it read.Now that the day has arrived, the mission to “storm Area 51” looks very different than it did during that moment of excited viral fame. It went from an online joke, to something that prompted action from both the US military and Facebook, to a potential disaster for the people who are intending to turn up after all.The event began as a joke. That much was clear from the description, which referenced an anime character and suggested people would be able to outrun bullets.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

Lets see them aliens.”The page developed in the same comedic manner, playing host to a variety of jokes and memes that sarcastically riffed on aliens and the secrets of the government.Storm Area 51 event could be disaster, locals fearBut it very quickly became very serious indeed. As interest in the Facebook page grew, so did anxiety that some people might really try to break into the base – and US Air Force spokesperson\u0026nbspLaura McAndrews\u0026nbspwas one of a number of officials who\u0026nbspgave a stern warning to anyone who did.Ms McAndrews added: “The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets”.Last month, the event disappeared from Facebook. It wasn’t clear exactly why, and at the point it was removed more than two million people had indicated they would take part.It was particularly frustrating for organiser Mr Roberts because he had attempted to parlay the interest into a real event: the equally ill-fated Alienstock. Rather than raiding Area 51, that woud be a festival devoted to the culture that surrounds it, attempting to harness people’s interest in the moment into something organised and profitable, rather than potentially lethal.There are now three different major events planned, with a number of others likely. It’s not clear how many people will be arriving in Nevada to take part in them.Two of the main ones are now called Alienstock, after some confusion and disagreement between the people organising them. One will happen in Las Vegas, and appears to be something like a more traditional EDM festival the other is taking place in the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada, in the heart of Area 51-country.It’s that event in particular that has led locals to “prepare for the worst”. Rachel is a tiny town, with a population of around 54, which is only about twice the number of musical acts advertised as performing at the event.Last month, the town’s official website posted a warning indicating that the event has a “high potential to get ugly”. The town and the harsh desert that surrounds it has few places for anyone to stay, is subject to wildly fluctuating temperatures, is home to dangerous animals and the local area has no internet,\u0026nbspphone signal or credit card facilities.Those warnings are still continuing as the weekend begins. This week, local Joerg Arnu said that people did not know what they were getting themselves in for.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” Arnu said. “Those who are looking for a big party are going to be disappointed.”He predicts people showing up in the desert in shorts and flip-flops.“That doesn’t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,” Arnu said. “It will get cold at night. They’re not going to find what they’re looking for, and they are going to get angry.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

week to 32 hours with no loss of pay within the next decade, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has announced.In a speech to the party’s annual conference in Brighton, Mr McDonnell said that – as well as pushing the move to a four-day week – Labour would set up a Working Time Commission with the power to recommend increases in statutory annual leave entitlements to be introduced “as quickly as possible without increasing unemployment”.To cheers from delegates, the shadow chancellor promised that a Labour government would end in-work poverty by restoring full trade union and workplace rights “on day one”, rolling out collective bargaining and bringing in a Real Living Wage of at least £10 an hour.And he confirmed that a\u0026nbspLabour government will introduce personal care for the

by having more leisure time.“We should work to live, not live to work,” said Mr McDonnell.Created with Sketch.Brexit and climate protests at Labour party conference: In pictures Show all 12Created

It will be a\u0026nbspshorter working week with no loss of pay.”Labour is not planning a French-style cap on maximum weekly working hours, but would take steps to encourage the agreement of reduced hours in negotiations between unions and employers.These could be taken in the form of extended holidays, shorter shifts or a four-day week, depending on the particular needs of different sectors.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMr McDonnell said that as a first step, a Labour government would end the UK’s opt-out from the European Working Time Directive.Labour would introduce a requirement for working hours to be included in legally-binding sectoral agreements, allowing unions and employers to decide together how best to reduce hours in their industry.TUC\u0026nbspgeneral secretary Frances O’Grady welcomed the announcement.“It’s time for working people to share in the benefits of new technology,” said Ms O’Grady. “That’s why unions have been arguing for less time at work, more time with family and friends and decent pay for everyone.“We welcome Labour’s commitment to move to a 32-hour week. Introducing more public holidays and enforcing safe limits on working hours is a sensible start.“Unions already negotiate agreements on working time in many workplaces. With greater freedom to bargain across sectors, we can help deliver a flexible transition that meets the needs of workers and businesses across different industries.”Mr McDonnell also announced the launch of a paper on Universal Basic Services, setting out Labour’s belief that “everyone has a right to a good life” and that the state has the responsibility to deliver it by providing public services free at the point of use.Denouncing the closure and sell-off\u0026nbspof parks, libraries, leisure centres and swimming pools under coalition and Conservative governments, he said:\u0026nbsp”These services are part of our shared experiences. Experiences that are too important to be left to the vagaries of the market. Whether a family can afford them or not.“As socialists we believe that people have the right to education, health, a home in a decent safe environment and, yes, access to culture and recreation.”Polling by YouGov\u0026nbspfound that 63 per cent of Britons would back a four-day week and 71 per cent thought it would make them happier, but only 17 per cent would support it if it meant them being poorer as a result. A four-day week was supported by 64 per cent of business managers questioned.But CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn warned that the 32-hour week – along with plans for nationalisation and the handover of shares to workers – would “risk hanging a ‘closed’ sign on the door of our open economy”.“Who would turn down a four-day week on the same pay? But without productivity gains it would push many businesses into loss,” said Ms Fairbairn.“Business has ideas and ambition to match Labour’s. It is time for Labour to root its polices in reality, not ideology. Firms have consistently offered to help shape an economy where prosperity is shared more widely. That offer still stands.”And\u0026nbspEdwin Morgan, the interim director general of the Institute of Directors, said:\u0026nbsp“Business confidence is already shaky, and directors are unlikely to feel more comfortable now.“Labour’s working week policy may be eye-catching, but it puts the cart before the horse. The only way to reduce hours while maintaining pay is by improving productivity. Companies agree with the Shadow Chancellor that the UK has a productivity problem, and want to work with any government to tackle it, but blunt regulation on working hours won’t get to the underlying issues.”Federation of Small Businesses chairman\u0026nbspMike Cherry\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbsp“It’s good to see that Labour have stopped short of proposing a weekly cap on working hours – small firms have struggled with negotiating the Working Time Directive, and it’s important that we avoid policies that could bring about similar challenges.“But our productivity gap cannot be closed by simply reducing working hours.

suggested attendees “all meet up” to “see them aliens” at the base which conspiracy theorists claim holds evidence of extraterrestrials.The event page was later shut down following condemnation from

One person starts something and it infects everybody with positivity. Anything can happen if you give people a place to be.The entertainment kicked off weekend events that also feature a gathering Friday and Saturday at the Alien Research Centre souvenir store in Hiko.Owner George Harris said it would focus on music, movies and talks about extraterrestrial lore.Authorities reported no serious incidents related to the festivals, which were\u0026nbspscheduled to last until Sunday.Hiko and Rachel are about a 45-minute drive apart on a state road dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway, and a two-hour drive from Las Vegas.Michael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the festivities sparked by the internet joke a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies, and the desire to know what we don\u0027t know.YouTuber sentenced to jail after attempting to film Area 51People desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve, he said. Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can\u0027t go. When you tell people they can\u0027t do something, they just want to do it more.Eric Holt, the Lincoln County emergency manager, said he believed authorities could handle 30,000 visitors at the two events. Still, neighbours braced for trouble after more than two million people responded to the Storm Area 51 Facebook post weeks ago.Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time, said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home.Those who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against critters, snakes and scorpions, he warned.It will get cold at night. They\u0027re not going to find what they\u0027re looking for, and they are going to get angry, he added.The Federal Aviation Administration closed nearby airspace, although Air Force jets could be heard in the sun-drenched skies, along with an occasional sonic boom.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It was eating our chickens and rabbits.Name: Champ ChampyLocation: Lake Champlain, USA and CanadaAppearance: Massive water snakeNessie isnt the only lake-based monster to capture the imagination of terried locals.Champ or Champy is a giant monster said to swim beneath the surface of Lake Champlain, which is split between New York, Vermont and Quebec.Over  sightings have been made of Champ, with the first recorded in .A sailor named Captain Crum said he saw an enormous serpentine monster which he reckoned to be around  feet long with three teeth and eyes the colour of peeled onions.He added that the creature had a belt of red around its neck and a white star on its forehead.P.T. Barnum, the historical figure played by Hugh Jackman in The Greatest Showman, even offered a reward to whoever brought him the monster.Interest in the lake snake exploded in  when Sandra Mansi snapped a picture of a huge creature sticking out of the water, and dozens of other images supposedly of Champ have been captured since.In , an article was published in a peer-reviewed scientic journal describing the discovery of sound measurements in the lake consistent with killer and beluga whales — neither of which are known to live in Lake Champlain.Name: Underwater panther MishipeshuLocation: Michipicoten Island and Great Lakes, CanadaAppearance: Scaly lynx with a spiked spineThe underwater panther or Mishipeshu is one of the most important mythical beings to the indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands around the Great Lakes in the USA and Canada.It has the head and claws of a giant Lynx-like cat, but has scales all over its body and has sharp spikes along its tail and back.The underwater panther is known for guarding huge copper reserves in the Great Lakes, with the copper on Michipicoten Island considered especially sacred property of the beast.A seventeenth century missionary called Claude Dablon told a tale of four Ojibwe people all being ripped apart by the underwater panther for taking its precious metal.Name: RompoLocation: Africa and IndiaAppearance: Skeletal body with the arms of a badger and the legs of a bearRompo is one of the strangest mythical creatures reported anywhere in the world.Its thought to have the head of a hare but with human ears on top a of a skeleton-like body, dragging itself around with the arms of a badger and the legs of a bear.Most disturbing of all, it only feeds on human corpses, making a soft low noise as it does so.When it finds a body, witnesses claim it circles the dead person several times before it begins feasting.Its also claimed that the Rompos skin changes colour, turning green when it moves among bushes and trees.Although sceptics think the Rompo is actually an old world porcupine, encounters with the beast have been logged in both India and across Africa.Name: Jersey Devil Leeds DevilLocation: New Jersey, USAAppearance: Goat-headed flying beast with hooves and the wings of a batThe Jersey Devil or Leeds Devil is a terrying bat-winged kangeroo-like creature with the head of a goat and cloven hooves.Its said that the devil moves quickly and cries with a high-pitched blood-curdling scream.The legend of the Jersey Devil began in , when New Jersey resident Jane Leeds cursed the baby in her womb when she found out she was pregnant for the thirteenth time.Then, on the stormy night when the child was born, it changed rapidly from a normal baby into a nightmare creature with a forked tail.Witnesses present at the horric event claimed the devil child screamed and growled before flying up the chimney and off into the woods.And then  years later, in , hundreds of sightings were reported in local newspapers about sightings and attacks of the Jersey Devil.Cops say they shot at it without effect and schools were closed in the Delaware Valley because of the widespread fear and panic.At the time, vigilante groups even took up arms to rid their communities of the beast.The fearsome legend lives on in the terrying -storey Jersey Devil rollercoaster set to open at Six Flags in New Jersey next year."},{"url":null,"title":"unelected judges blocking brexit constitutional vandalism","story":"It is a stunt by rich Remainers whose only concern for democracy is that it must always deliver what they want.Failing that, their money, fancy QCs and our courts must do so instead.This weekend our top judges will ponder whether Boris Johnson suspended Parliament unlawfully, not to set up a new programme for Government but to avoid scrutiny of his Brexit strategy.But courts should have no veto over political decisions. Not unless we want to be ruled by unelected judges and unelected millionaire litigants, on top of unelected peers and unaccountable Speakers.Andthese judges do now demand Parliament’s recall, what will Remainer MPs do with all their new sitting time They have already passed their law to “prevent No Deal”.

Corbyn hasn’t committed to either side. In an interview yesterday, he refused to answer the question EIGHT TIMES.So, we are in the absurd position of a man running to be Prime Minister not being able to say where he would stand on the biggest issue facing the country in decades.Little wonder that more than three quarters of voters are dissatisfied with his performance.Corbyn is betting that he can quarantine the issue of Brexit. His strategy is to offer a second referendum then fight a general election on classic Left Right lines.The problem with this plan is that British politics is so dominated by Brexit that you HAVE to have an answer on that before you can talk about anything .Is Jeremy Corbyn really intending to spend the entire election campaign refusing to say how he would vote in the referendum he is calling for Corbyn’s equivocation is a particular problem, given the clarity in the other parties’ positions.The Lib Dem conference agreed this week thatthe party won a majority in a general election — stop sniggering at the back — they would simply revoke Article .This clear policy is helping them scoop up more and more Remainer votes. One poll this week had them overtaking Labour and pulling in support from more than  per cent of those who backed Remain in .If the Lib Dems get anywhere near this level of support in a general election, then Labour will lose seats to BOTH the Lib Dems and the Tories.As one gleeful Cabinet minister points out, the Lib Dem position “shines a spot-light on Labour’s ambiguity”.Many in the Shadow Cabinet are worried about Corbyn’s refusal to say where he stands. Many of them want Labour to state clearly that it is the party of Remain.Expect an effort at next week’s Labour conference to change the party’s position to make it clear that as a party Labour WILL IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES campaign for Remain in a second referendum.The other problem with Corbyn’s position is that it means this whole debate will just drag on. Another negotiation with Brussels followed by another referendum would take at least six months, and maybe more.This isn’t going to be popular with an electorate that wants this issue resolved so the country can move on and start addressing the domestic issues voters care about most.At the last election, Corbyn managed to skilfully straddle the Brexit ide.He hoovered up the votes of Remainers but with a manesto that promised to respect the referendum result, held on to heavily Leave-supporting seats too.It will be far harder,not impossible, for Corbyn to pull off that trick again. The danger for him is that his fence-sitting ends up alienating both groups.AT his book launch, David Cameron told the assembled guests that he had tried to avoid writing too much about scandals in the memoir.But he did remember when a Tory peer got caught up in an SM sting early in his leadership.It was put to him that he should remove the whip, to which Cameron replied: “Shouldn’t we take the handcuffs off too ”“WHAT was he thinking ’ one loyal, long-time supporter of David Cameron declared to me after the former PM revealed how he had worked behind the scenes to get the Queen to make an intervention in the Scottish independence referendum.The Palace is understandably cross about the revelation, which undermines the Queen’s political neutrality.One Whitehall source tells me the Palace are “apoplectic” about it and can’t understand why a former Prime Minister would break such an important confidence in such a pre-meditated way.Belatedly, Cameron seems to have realised the trouble he’s caused – refusing to answer further questions on it for TV.But as someone who has worked for three Tory leaders tells me: “It is one of the weirdest unforced errors I have ever seen.”As part of efforts to deal with this problem, Operation Anson has been launched. This week, the team involved arrested  people on suspicion of involvement in this activity after targeting  marinas and harbours.The test of this surge in enforcement activity will be whether it stamps out this vile trade before more people perish in the Channel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He quit Labour to be an independent MP in February over the “culture of extremism and intolerance” created by Mr Corbyn.Today Mr Austin launches cross-party campaign group Mainstream, aimed at combating extremism in public le.He said: “I grew up listening to my father, a Holocaust refugee, warning of the dangers of prejudice and hatred.“I joined Labour as a teenager and campaigned for it all my adult le.“But the party of today is not the one I grew up in.“Under Jeremy Corbyn it has been poisoned by a culture of extremism and intolerance. It is the responsibility of everyone who opposes extremism in all its forms to stand up against this destructive force.”The poll found  per cent are proud of Britain’s history over the past  years, with  per cent “ashamed”.Only  per cent believe in retaining the monarchy while  per cent want a republic.Twenty per cent would be “happy” or “proud” to sing the anthem but half would be “bored, embarrassed or angry”.More members,  per cent, blame the Government for the atrocities of the Troubles than blame Republican terrorists like the IRA .Just  per cent think groups like al-Qaeda are the most to blame for Islamist terrorist attacks in the UK. A total of  per cent think the UK and its allies are most to blame, while  per cent blame both sides equally.Meanwhile  per cent support using strikes to overthrow a Conservative government.A huge  per cent agree with getting rid of Britain’s nuclear weapons. Almost half,  per cent, want to abolish our country’s borders.A total of  per cent support new laws limiting who owns national newspapers. And  per cent say a Labour government should take more control of broadcast media.We stand up to extremism, racism and prejudice. That’s the British way.Sun readers expect their government to defend their country abroad, maintain their security at home and keep their streets safe. They certainly don’t expect a party which might be in power in just a few weeks to tear itself to pieces in the way Labour has done in the last  hours.Tom Watson has given the party he loves decades of service. But because the extremists who now control Labour don’t trust him to bow to all of their demands, they tried to abolish his job while he was at home looking after his son.Mainstream is a new campaign to stand up for these values and warn people of the dangers of extremism.We will promote respectable and responsible politics wherever we can, and we will oppose extremism - wherever it comes from.We’ll oppose extremism on the far left or the hard right, and today we are highlighting the impact of a government led by Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left.I thought I knew how badly Jeremy Corbyn had poisoned the Labour Party.I quit after  years as a member to shine a spotlight on the extremism and racism.But even I was shocked by this new poll showing what Labour members now actually think.Under Corbyn, half say they would be bored, embarrassed or angryasked to sing the National Anthem.Just  per cent are proud of our country’s history. Almost three times as many are ashamed.More than six out of ten want to abolish the monarchy and more of them blame the British Government and our brave army than the IRA and other republican terrorists for the violent troubles in Northern Ireland.Almost half want to abolish our country’s borders and nearly seven out of ten members think it would be ok for trade unions to hold a general strike to remove a Conservative Government.More than half either blame the media or Jeremy Corbyn’s political opponents for the allegations of racism against Jewish people instead of the members responsible or the leadership that has allowed it to happen.Sixty-nine per cent of Labour members now blame Western Governments instead of Terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS for Islamist terrorist attacks on the streets of Britain or think they are equally to blame as groups like Al Qaeda or ISIS!You would never have got results like that under previous Labour leaders, but the Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left is completely outside Britain’s mainstream political traditions. They can’t be trusted to uphold our country’s values or safeguard the institutions on which our democracy depends.Corbyn’s supporters claim he is ing the party to its socialist roots, but it’s just not true.Clement Attlee’s great post-war government established the NHS and the Welfare State, but he was a proud British patriot who set up NATO, insisted on Britain having nuclear weapons and booted communists out of the party.There are still decent people in the Labour Party, fighting for common-sense, but good MPs have been targeted, smeared or driven out and all sorts of people from the fringes of politics have joined to support Jeremy Corbyn.All this explains why we are setting up Mainstream, a new campaign - led by a group of people from dferent political backgrounds – to encourage ato respectable and responsible politics, and to banish extremism from British politics once and for all.To lead Britain, you must love this country, but Jeremy Corbyn is the opposite of a patriot. He could not be trusted with our national security or to defend our country. At every available opportunity, he has backed Britain’s enemies, whether that’s the IRA at the height of the Troubles or groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.No previous Labour leadership would have supported dictatorships in Cuba or Venezuela or have sided with the Russian dictator’s line on Ukraine or when his killers used chemical weapons to bring death to Salisbury. The hard-left think that wealth is the problem and the people who create it the enemy. A government led by Jeremy Corbyn would see John McDonnell in the Treasury, but our economy has never before been run by someone who says he wants to overthrow capitalism or says Marx, Lenin and Trotsky are his most signicant influences.Jeremy Corbyn surrounds himself and works with people from the far-left fringes of politics and they could not be trusted to respect and uphold the independence of our civil service, the impartiality and fairness of our broadcasters or the freedom of the press.It is a disgrace that he and the people around him have allowed a party with a fine tradition of fighting for fairness and equality to be poisoned by racism against Jewish people.Under Corbyn, mainstream ideas are being replaced by views that are wildly out of step with the views of the general public. Extremism is rearing its way back into the public discourse in a way that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.We encourage everyone who wants to support our country’s mainstream values in political and public le to join us. The left-wing grassroots body — set up just weeks after Corbyn won his  leadership contest — now has , members. It was based on the Syriza movement in Greece and Podemos in Spain, both of which  also fought against austerity measures.Cambridge graduate Lansman, , tried to run the party machine last year by mounting a failed bid to replace  out- going Iain McNicol as general secretary.

time the parcel was signed for because he had to wait in the queue with regular customers.Items under special delivery, of which Mr Lockyer successfully delivered around , over the course of his career, are guaranteed to arrive between am and pm the following day.A disciplinary meeting in October  saw Lockyer accused of gross misconduct over the incident, which had occurred the previous month, Kent Live reported.John Peter, delivery officer manager at Mr Lockyers branch, accused him of continual failure to follow correct procedures.Lockyer appealed the decision, but it was upheld at an employment tribunal in July.The tribunal heard Mr Lockyers performance at work had not been entirely satisfactory and that it was clear from the evidence that the claimant was a challenging employee.Independent casework manager Sue Knight-Smith said: To suggest the dismissal was for being one minute late was not a true reflection of what actually happened.She said Mr Lockyer was aware of bank protocols but chose to ignore the noon PDA alert and left the delivery until the last moment.The case dismissed after Mr Lockyer withdrew claims for unpaid wages and redundancy pay.The tribunal heard that Lockyer had been given a serious warning in May of last year after failing to secure his vehicle.Three months later, he received a dismissal penalty, suspended for  months, for failing to obtain a signature for a delivery.At the time of the second incident, he was told going forward any breach of standards will lead to your dismissal”.Mr Peter said that a late delivery would usually result in a penalty valid for one or two years, but that Mr Lockyers dismissal was justied because of his record.After the hearing, Mr Lockyer said in a statement he was “bitterly upset” at the “harsh” treatment he had received.“I can’t believe what has happened to me – all I wanted to do was to do my job, he said.“I really hope the union can make this right.I just want to get back to work.”Mark Baulch, outdoor secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said Mr Lockyers case was probably one of the most outrageous dismissals by Royal Mail and Tribunal verdict I’ve ever heard about.“Make no mistake, this union is appealing this decision legally and, in the meantime, we’ll also be taking up this case with the company at the highest possible level, he said.The delay is obviously due to the unusual procedure of the bank itself in telling our member to queue alongside the other bank customers.“How on earth our member could be considered to be at fault here is completely beyond me – this is why the culture within the workplace must change, once and for all."},{"url":null,"title":"fresh blow for jeremy corbyn as tories open up 15 point lead over

It is expected to cost the taxpayer up to £ million.Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the liquidation of Thomas Cook as a very dficult situation and vowed his Government would do its level best to get Brit holidaymakers home.- There are , Thomas Cook travellers who have been left stuck at  destinations in  countries.- More than , of those are Britons.- The airlt is almost twice the size of the repatriation effort required when Monarch went bust in October .- The final cost of the programme is expected to be around £ million.- Forty charter planes have been brought in from as far afield as Malaysia to help with the rescue mission.- Only holidaymakers withflights booked within the next two weeks, between Monday and Sunday October , will qualy for a free flight home, as close as possible to their originaldate."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn brexit remain labour conference leadership","story":"The Labour boss raged at the media today just hours before he could be forced into a humiliating u-turn to back Remaining in the EU - spelling doom for his leadership.As he was followed by reporters this morning Mr Corbyn shouted: This is our conference, these are our stalls!Your behaviour, pushing past people, pushing people over and pushing people who want to visit stalls, is totally unacceptable!And he blasted: I’m asking you to behave with respect to our members and our conference.It comes after he snapped repeatedly at BBC boss Andrew Marr yesterday during an interview.The leftie Labour boss is getting ready for an almighty showdown at the partys annual conference in Brighton today over whether to fully back Remain or not.Mr Corbyn wants yet another fudge on Brexit - kicking the decision into the long grass for after an election.Yesterday he refused nine times to say how he or Labour would campaign in a second referendum, and would only say that the party would decide it later on.But senior Labour figures including Sir Keir Starmer, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry are fighting tooth and nail to try and force the party into backing Remain no matter what.The Shadow Foreign Secretary Ms Thornberry warned yesterday that Labour could lose a THIRD of its entire vote to the Lib Dems and Greens in a future election.And she told a happy audience at conference this afternoon: I believe we must strive day and night, whatever it takes, to keep Britain in the European Union.Members and union delegates will vote this evening on at least three dferent Brexit motions - and will decide whether to back all of them or none.One motion says Labour will campaign energetically for a public vote and to stay in the EU for that referendum - and is favoured by pro Remain members who want Britain to stay in the EU.The other is a Brexit waffle motion which backs Mr Corbyns plan, adding they will campaign for a public vote in line with the policy set out at out  conference.It doesnt commit to anything specically concrete on when to make a decision on leaving the EU.A third motion from Labours top National Executive Committeeis a similar fudge, pledging to decide the Brexit position at a special conference later on.By the end of the day all three motions could pass in a titanic battle for the soul of the party.Unions Unite and GMB have come out for Mr Corbyns Brexit fudge plan - which could save his skin tonight.GMB leader Tim Roache said earlier: What we’re saying is, we negotiate a deal, then we assess whether it’s better than what we already have.And Unites Len McCluskey told conference: Please give Jeremy the support he needs later.But Unison said this morning they would OPPOSE the NECs motion - in a huge break with tradition which could tip the balance towards Remain.They will vote for the pro-Remain motion instead, which could force the party into backing Remain in ALL circumstances, and leave Mr Corbyn red-faced.Meanwhile on the other end of the party MP Stephen Kinnock joked that Labour has had more Brexit positions than the Karma Sutra.The Aberavon MP described the first few days of the conference as utter shambles and slammed the partys move away from respecting the referendum.Our position on Brexit is being treated with ridicule on the doorsteps in my constituency, he said.We could end up passing three contradictory motions and then it would be up to those writing the manesto to decide. Good luck with that.The dramatic move puts the vote on a kne edge tonight and plunges the party into further chaos.Momentum boss Jon Lansman blasted: I’m incredibly disappointed with the process by which today’s NEC statement on Brexit was produced. There was no meeting, no discussion, no consultation with the membership.And Tories immediately launched into their confusing Brexit stance.Jake Berry MP said: Labour will negotiate a new Brexit deal, then hold a special conference to decide which side to back.Theyll then ignore the  referendum and hold another, where theyll either support Remain, the deal theyve negotiated or stay neutral.Got it  🤔The unfolding explosion in Labour came as:Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said this morning: I think people should express their own judgement on this.There will be some who think we can get adeal, but there will be others like myself who think you cannot get a better deal than Remain.Yesterday Mr Corbyn vowed to respect whatever the party decides today.If the Labour boss loses tonight it would be a huge blow to his authority as leader - and puts him on a collision course with the rest of his pro-Remain party.Whatever members vote for will likely go into the partys next election manesto.But Andrew Gwynne Shadow Communities Secretary told Radio s Westminster Hour last night that the shadow cabinet have been told by Jeremy Corbyn that they can campaign as they want on Brexit in a future referendum - just like in the  EU vote.Meanwhile MPs were openly threatening another leadership challenge as rumours swirled around that Mr Corbyn could be forced to quit.Yesterday the Labour boss said he had no plans to stand down and would lead the party into the next election - serving a whole five yearshe wins.It comes the day after his policy chief Andrew Fisher announced his plans to quit his role - in a huge blow to Mr Corbyn.The man who wrote Labours last manesto said he would resign this year, with a blast on the blizzard of lies in the party and attacking senior figures close to the leftie boss."},{"url":null,"title":"steve irwin family feud joy bob australia zoo","story":"The Crocodile Hunter star died in Batt Reef, Australia, after a stingrays barb pierced his heart.Joy says she would have spoken about the rt earlier, but there was a confidentiality agreement stopping her from doing so.But since it has now lapsed, Joy told the Daily Mail, the state of her familys current relationship is very sad.She added: I keep away from all that.

Hotels are going to look after their clients but logically we’re not going to provide planes or provide free accommodation for days on end when the bill for unpaid stays in Benidorm alone is already at the one million euro mark.”The uncertainty hanging over the future of British holidaymakers’ continuing stays in Spain contrasted with the initial phases of the plane rescue operation.A spokesman for Spanish airports authority AENA said Majorca’s Palma Airport, where five repatriation flights were due to take off this morning to several UK destinations including Manchester and Glasgow, was operating “with total normality.”The spokesman said: “Other airlines are flying the holidaymakers back to the UK.“Their reallocation on other planes has been organised with the help of the British consulate.“For Palma today, five Thomas Cook flights with , seats on board were due to leave.“Everything appears to be ing normally and we are not aware of any problems at Palma Airport.”According to local reports, Iberia agreed to take the first tourists on Majorca back.

Speaking to reporters during his flight to New York for the summit, Mr Johnson also pledged to challenge President Rouhani to release jailed British mum Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe when the pair meet face-to-face in the sidelines of the summit. The UK Government has now attributed the recent attacks on Saudi oil facilities with “a high degree of probability.” On Friday the Pentagon announced the US will send additional troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.    Yemen-based Houthi rebels, who are locked in a war with Saudi Arabia, have claimed responsibility for the attacks, which sent global oil prices soaring. But a Senior UK Government Official said last night their claim of responsibility was “implausible” because of the sophistication and range of the weapons used in the attack. Iran has denied responsibility. Mr Johnson said: “Clearly the dficulty is how do we organise a response - what is the way forward - and we’ll be working with our American and European Friends to construct a response that tries to de-escalate tensions in the gulf region.” He wouldn’t rule out military action, but said it would only happen at the request of Saudi Arabia or the US.    He said: “On what kind of action we can take, you will have seen that the Americans are proposing to do more to help to defend SA and we will be following that. “If we are asked by the Saudis or the Americans to have a role then we would consider in what way we could be useful.“ Ms Zaghari-Ratclfe, , was arrested in  while in the country visiting family. She was sentenced to five years in prison after being accused of spying, which she strongly denies.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for a neutral position going into a general election , saying that he would negotiate a new Brexit deal with Brussels which would then be put to a referendum.Under his approach the partyaposs position on how to campaign would not be decided until a special conference, after the expected general election. But delegates at Labouraposs conference in Brighton will vote on whether the party should decide now on whether to campaign to stay in the European Union, eventhat means rejecting a deal Mr Corbyn has negotiated with the EU. Earlier today Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said he will campaign for a Remain vote in the promised referendum. But his shadow cabinet colleague went further asking delegates to vote for the Remain motion.   She told the hall: With your endorsement today, conference, with the instructions that I hope you give us today, I believe we must strive day and night, whatever it takes, to keep Britain in the European Union. Despite urging delegates to vote for a motion in direct contradiction of Jeremy Corbynaposs position, Ms Thornberry also called for party unity.    She said: We must keep our eyes on the prize, we must keep our unity and our discipline, we must keep focused on getting Labour back into power. It is understood that Unison will vote against the NEC statement on Brexit later today at the partyaposs annual conference, and support the motion calling for Labour to campaign for remain. A source said the move was aimed at giving a clear and unambiguous message on Brexit to help bring about the election of a Labour government. Most other unions are expected to support the NEC statement. Sources in the GMB told the Mirror they would back the NEC statement but it was not clear whether they would abstain or oppose the Remain motion. Meanwhile the shopkeepers union Usdaw, who have a smaller number of delegates than the big three, said they would vote for all options. General Secretary Paddy Lillis said: The Tories have failed on Brexit. As things currently stand, Usda wants Labour to go into a general election with a clear position to back remain, as this protects jobs and workers’ rights. However,and when Labour wins and negotiates a new Brexit deal, that would require the Party to review its position, at a one-day conference, ahead of a referendum with credible options to leave or remain.”  But Unite will oppose the Remain motion. The unionaposs General Secretary Len McCluskey pleaded with delegates to back Mr Corbyn. He told the conference: I implore you, please give Jeremy the support he needs later so that prime minister Corbyn can lead us to a bright new dawn.

Emily Thornberry is going to announce a manesto pledge on Monday to give every living nuclear test veteran £,.    I heard it but could not comprehend it. Right, I said. Seventeen years of covering the same story began to unfold in my head, like the fireballs the veterans have told me about, and a few seconds later the shockwave hit. My knees went from under me as the enormity of what a £m promise meant arrived at the back of my skull. Barry. Archie. Shirley. Ken. Mick and Rose, Lucy and John, Wendy, Jean, Dave, Shelley, John... Some are alive, and many are dead. But all have, finally, been heard.   Barry Smith was sent to Christmas Island in . It was his job to cut the hair of men decontaminating it after dozens of nuclear tests.When he developed a rare form of pancreatic cancer he applied for a war pension he could leave to his we Anna. With weeks to live, he struggled to a war pension appeal, which would hear evidence his cancer had been seen in the survivors of Hiroshima. The MoD lawyer stood, said they had not read it, and asked for an adjournment. Barry responded: Are you aware that Iaposm dying  It had taken all his strength to get there. He had no time left. The hearing was adjourned, and Barry died  days later. Anna was denied a widowaposs pension.    RAF pilot Eric Denson used to patrol the Iron Curtain in a Canberra bomber, testing the radar defences separating East and West. The dad of two was sent to Christmas Island in , and ed weeks later with a large red burn across his chest. His urbane personality had changed to being abrupt, dark, and destructive. He and we Shirley had two more children, but he suffered crippling headaches. He killed himself on the third attempt, in . Shirley raised their four girls alone. She saw grandchildren born, some with missing and extra teeth, others with spinal deformities. Years later she found documents from the MoD archives showing Eric had flown into a mushroom cloud, and in  minutes had  yearsapos worth of background radiation delivered directly to his brain. Chillingly, the documents called it the initial experiment.   Archie Ross died in , aged , of non-Hodgkinaposs lymphoma. For  years he had repeated hospital visits to cut away a layer of skin that had begun growing between his eyelid and eyeball. He had a grandchild with Downaposs, and his daughter Julie was born with a twisted ribcage and outsized arm. Ken McGinley was unable to have children. He founded the BNTVA and in  took their case to Strasbourg, and is now a full-time carer for his we. Shelly Grigg is living with Dercumaposs disease, a condition in which fatty tissue tumours grow in her abdomen and have to be surgically removed. Wendy Brothers still cries talking about the death of husband John, who had  brain tumours, and the babies they lost. Jean Sinfield took her late husband Bertaposs case all the way to the Supreme Court. Dave Whyte has had so many Freedom of Information battles with the MoD that at one point they refused to speak to him.   These are the people who for  years have been gaslighted by their own governments. They were told they were imagining the things that were a central feature of their lives. They have, unsurprisingly, elevated rates of anxiety, depression and mental illness. They said the same thing: Theyaposre waiting for us to die. Of the , men who took part in the hundreds of nuclear tests Britain held between  and  in America, Australia and the South Pacic, itaposs thought thereaposs only , alive. Justice delayed is justice denied, and that was never truer than for the , men who died on the way here. But some justice is better than none at all.   Some will say words are cheap, that politicians have said things before, and thereaposs no chance of a Labour government. But Emily Thornberryaposs promise is the first time anyone turned to those people, and said: We can hear you. When they heard the news, each veteran and widow said the same thing. Youaposre kidding me. Then: Oh my God. And finally: The money doesnapost matter. Theyaposve heard us. Every party has promised the veterans something in Opposition, only to forget it in power. But this time the Labour Party has made a clear manesto promise of doing more for its test veterans than any other nuclear power on Earth. This pledge is set in concrete now, and to break it will break them.  It might be decades before we see a Labour majority government. But when the Mirror campaigned to change the rules on organ donation, Labour made it a manesto pledge. The Tories nicked the idea, and the glory, and passed it into law. In a time of turmoil, with hung parliaments and coalitions, a pledge costing as little as £m can and will be used to build cross-party support. And at election time, Whitehall civil servants must prepare to enact all party manestos on day  of a new government. So the men in suits at the MoD, those bureaucrats so long blamed for blocking the veteransapos path, must finally do the sums that add up to official recognition. The institutional change in thinking that will require is itself a victory.    Widows do not qualy for this promise. Nor do dead men, or their children and grandchildren. But it is still a win for them. This is not the end. The test veterans never stopped fighting, and nor will we. Money for survivors must be matched with war pensions for widows, research and genetic counselling for descendants, and a medal from the Queen in honour of their courage. Those things are all more likely because of this promise. Today, the Labour Party has done a good thing. Emily Thornberry has put the test veterans centre stage, and dared the other parties to see what our country has done to them. To a government, £m is nothing. To an old man who watched the atom split, £, is not the point. Widows cannot get their men or their babies back. But they can be acknowledged and their minds put at ease. And, perhaps, this is the start of better weather for the test veterans. The clouds have finally begun to clear.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was no Brexit connection despite businesses dangling in uncertainty and the value of the pound - which has plummeted since the  EU referendum - hitting UK holidaymakers. The Cabinet minister instead blamed the crisis on Thomas Cookaposs long term problems as a business as its model is left out of date by the internet. Mr Hancockaposs comments do match recent reports on Thomas Cook, which have stressed the firm had been hit by high debt levels, online rivals and geopolitical uncertainty. However, he did not mention that Thomas Cook itself also warned uncertainty around Brexit was hitting bookings industry-wide four months ago. In a statement announcing a loss of more than £bn on May , the firm said: In the UK, the political uncertainty related to Brexit over recent months has led to softer demand for summer holidays across the industry.  While our booking position remains ahead of the capacity reductions in the tour operator, the trading backdrop remains highly competitive, leading to increased levels of promotional activity. We have seen no tangible change to booking patterns in recent weeks since the announcement of a delay to Brexit, although we will shortly start to lap a weaker comparative period. It added: The prolonged heatwave last summer and high prices in the Canaries reduced customer demand for winter sun, particularly in the Nordic region, while there is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many UK customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer. The Civil Aviation Authority is leading a £m repatriation effort for , stranded Brits using more than  planes after the -year-old firm collapsed overnight.   The package holiday giant needed another £m on top of a £m package it had already agreed, to see it through the winter months. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was askedBrexit was a factor on LBC Radio by host Nick Ferrari.He replied: No. I donapost think thereaposs any Brexit connection. We just heard... about the long term problems Thomas Cook has had as a business. Itaposs the sort of business that in the last century we used to use all the time - I remember booking one of my first holidays that I every booked through Thomas Cook. Now I just go straight to the internet.    Lots of companies have been disrupted by the internet. I think the big disruption from the internet is bigger than Brexit. I think itaposs the biggest thing happening over our generation, and weaposve got to make sure every part of le is as prepared as possible for that, including the health service which Iaposm responsible for. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps added: The company had enormous debts of £. billion. The world had changed in terms of the way people book holidays and all these things over a very long period of time had caught Thomas Cook out.

The betting company has accepted a flurry of bets in the last week on Kate being pregnant after she made several public appearances. Kate, , was snapped with a new hairdo while taking Princess Charlotte to her first day at school two weeks ago - which led to pregnancy rumours online. She also touched up her hair up seven weeks before she announced she was pregant with Prince George and shortly before revealing she was going to give birth to Princess Charlotte. Body language expert Judi James told Daily Star Online: “Like a lot of women Kate does tend to change her hair when she is pregnant, although not dramatically.    “The new style and colour she emerged with when she took George and Charlotte to school did look like one of her glossiest and most fashionable looks to date. “But then she did say she’d had it done for the school run, and it could have been aimed at giving her an emotional lt as Charlotte left home for school for the first time.” Judi also said that another sign Kate is pregnant is that she was pictured touching her belly during her visit to the school. “Kate did meet a lot of small children and one baby in particular recently and it wasn’t hard to describe her teeth-baring, dimple-creating smile of utter delight as she stroked the baby’s head and chatted to the children as broodiness,” she said. “She also touched her belly, which is a common gesture of protection from women in the early stages of pregnancy. “However this is a gesture that Kate uses a lot, pregnant or not, so tends to be less than reliable as a clue. She did look broody but she appears besotted with youngest child Louis and the baby she met could just have reminded her of him.”    Celebrity stylist Jay Birmingham told Fabulous Digital: “Kate’s new colour has brightened her complexion and the use of lighter pieces throughout the top of her hair and around her face add dimension and give the illusion of thicker hair. The signs have forced Ladbrokes to pull the plug on all bets on Kate having a baby in . Alex Apati of Ladbrokes told the Star: Royal fans reckon Kate is showing early signs of a potential pregnancy. Weaposve welcomed two royal babies into the world in as many years and punters are seemingly confident Kate will make it three in three. “Weaposve taken a flurry of bets across the country in shop over the last week or so following recent royal appearances from the Duchess of Cambridge.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A young woman was left humiliated after a male pharmacist at Boots refused to give her an emergency supply of her contraceptive pill .Maggie Richmond, , blasted the senior employeeaposs misogynistic attitude after going to the chemist on advice from her GP. The doctor had suggested she collect a repeat prescription of the tablets there but the pharmacist wouldnapost help her.He wouldnapost even give his reason for refusing to give the emergency supply to me - maybe he did have a good reason but heaposs not got a leg to stand on by not speaking to me, Maggie told Daily Record today.The occupational therapist visited the Boots branch in Edinburgh city centre earlier this month and initially found shop assistants to be very unhelpful.    She said: I went in and explained to the shop assistant,I could speak to the pharmacist about getting this emergency one monthaposs supply. She was really quite tight-lipped and not that accommodating or friendly and said she would ask the pharmacist - she came back and told me, aposHe says no.apos I told her this is what my GP is advising me to do - so she went back to speak to him again then came back and told me, aposNo, sorryapos. The vibe I was getting was that his refusal was specically to do with what I was asking for. That he didnapost want to give it to me. He looked up when I came in then refused to come out and speak to me. Thereaposs a private consulting room and that option wasnapost offered to me.    Maggie went to another two pharmacies, both with female pharmacists who she said would have been happy to provide the medication, but didnapost have any in stock. She was then served in another Boots by a female pharmacist who she said treated her with respect and dignity before prescribing her the emergency supply. Maggie, who works at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, said: I am most concerned this extremely negative experience appears to have been the result of a misogynistic attitude.  I am a strong and independent -year-old inidual with a thick skin and I found this humiliating - I can only imagine how a young or more vulnerable woman would be made to feel in these circumstances. It seemed that he really didnapost have that right to refuse me. Emma Ritch, executive director of Scottish feminist organisation Engender, said: Many people reading this will be shocked to learn that it is still seen as perfectly acceptable for pharmacists to withhold prescribed medication from patients based on their personal moral beliefs. Although guidelines require pharmacists to offer assistance to customers in finding an alternate provider, this clearly didnapost happen in this instance. This is not an isolated incident and it raises huge questions about access to contraception for disabled women, women with caring responsibilities, women in rural areas, women experiencing poverty, and other women who are not easily able to travel to multiple pharmacies to get hold of a prescribed medication.

As well as watching performances from local people and having a quick dance with women dressed in traditional costume, Meghan and Harry both gave moving speeches. Meghan praised the work the organisation has been doing, and said she was visiting on a personal level as well as in her role as a member of the Royal Family. She said: I want you to know that for me I am here with you as a mother, as a we, as a woman, as a woman of colour and as your sister.    I am here with you and I am here for you and I thank you so much for showing my husband and I the spirit of Ubuntu and I look forward to our time over the next few days together. When it was Harryaposs turn on the microphone he spoke about his love for South Africa, menaposs treatment of women and being a role model for Archie. He said: No man is born to cause harm to women. This is learned behaviour and we need to break that cycle. Your strength is in your spirit which for me means honouring and protecting my we and being a positive role model for my son. Here are both of their speeches in full:    Meghanaposs speech in full Hello! It is such privilege to meet all of you today and to start our visit, my first time in South Africa, here in Nyanga. We have just spent some time seeing all the incredible work that the Justice Desk does and of course all of you amazing women and the men who are here helping you, Mbokodo, you are incredible and what you’re doing is so powerful, because you’re all powerful. The work that’s being done here is to keep women and children safer, which is needed now more than ever. This is an issue that’s been at the forefront of people’s minds here in South Africa, and of course across the globe, particularly over this past month. Please know that my husband and I have been closely following what you’ve been experiencing here – as best we can from afar. But now that we are with you, we are eager to learn and see first-hand the work that you’re doing, the vital work that you’re doing, and that everything that is being done on the ground is making the great change that you not only need but that you deserve.    You have welcomed us into this community, have been open and honest with us, both about the dangers women and children face, and about how you are addressing them. The rights of women and girls is something that is very close to my heart, and the cause I have spent the majority of my le advocating for because I know that when women are empowered, the entire community flourishes. So to be able to meet all of you today who are standing up for what’s right in the face of adversity, I applaud you. We are encouraged to hear your President take the next steps to work towards preventing gender-based violence through education and necessary changes to reinforce the values of modern South Africa. I do have to say I feel incredibly humbled to be in the presence of all of you as you stand firm in your core values of respect, dignity and equality. I read a quote a few weeks ago and it resonated with me as I’ve been watching what’s been happening here and your active efforts. Maya Angelou, the legendary poet and civil rights activist, once said: “Each time a woman stands up for herself, without knowing it, possibly without claiming it, she stands up for all women.” Now I know it’s not easy and I know it must feel insurmountable at times, but your commitment to what is right gives all of us hope, especially your brothers and sisters here in your community who need you to continue to shine your light brightly. Your commitment is inspiring, it is energising and it is extraordinary. You must keep going, you must know that what you’re doing not only matters, it is vital because YOU are vital.    And just on one personal note, may I just say that while I am here with my husband as a member of The Royal Family, I want you to know that for me I am here with you as a mother, as a we, as a woman, as a woman of colour and as your sister. I am here with you and I am here FOR you and I thank you so much for showing my husband and I the spirit of Ubuntu and I look forward to our time over the next few days together. Thank you so much for having us. Prince Harryaposs speech Thank you very much for the warm welcome today. It was incredibly important for my we and I to begin our trip here in Nyanga with you so thank you for having us. As someone who has visited this amazing country many times, and as someone who regards Cape Town as a uniquely special place in Africa, I wanted to ensure that our first visit as a family, with my we by my side, focused on the signicant challenges facing millions of South Africans while acknowledging the hope that we feel so strongly here.    We are so incredibly grateful to be able to listen and learn from you about the issues that define your daily lives in these communities. And thataposs what this is: a community. A community where men and women have a vital role to play. Touching on what your president said last week, no man is born to cause harm to women this is learned behaviour and a cycle that needs to be broken. Itaposs about redefining masculinity, itaposs about creating your own footprints for your children to follow in so that you can make a positive change for the future.

Michelle Eling was watching daughter Brittany, , and one-year-old grandaughter Olivia playing on the kitchen floor of her house in Alvin, Texas. Suddenly the -year-old granaposs rescue dog Harvey approached the baby and attacked her. Before the hound could be stopped it had caused permanent damage to the young girl, nearly ripping off her right ear. The three-foot-tall pooch since been put down after trying to get Oliviaaposs whole head in his mouth. Dog lover Michelle, an accountant, said: “I was standing in the kitchen, Olivia and Brittany were on the floor playing, Brittany was making her giggle.  “I heard Harvey growl. Then I just heard Brittany scream ‘no’, I turned round and saw him lunge at Olivia. “If he hadn’t and he had got hold of her head, I would have had to decide who to save, my pregnant daughter or my granddaughter. All that was going through my mind was, ‘she is not dying in my kitchen’.  There was so much blood, I thought she was going to bleed out. Brittany has three children with chemical plant worker husband, Taylor, , including Mason, three, and Madison, two months. At the time of the attack she was eight months pregnant with her youngest. Regardless, she helped rush Olivia to hospital, where she was kept for two days undergoing one hour of surgery to reattach the tip of her right ear and a two hour skin graft on the top of her head. The attack has left her with permanent scars on her face.  Harvey, who is believed to have been abused by his previous owners, was taken into quarantine for  days by animal control before being put down. Brittany said: “We were supposed to be going home but my Mason wanted to see his grandmother. “It started off normal.

I was pregnant but I wasn’t thinking about me. I just wanted to save my daughter.” Brittany wanted the dog put down, as she realised how close she had come to losing her daughter.

Ashley, Iseult and Megan Manning say their terried mother, Mary, was held like a slave for almost two decades by their evil dad Sean McDarby. The sisters, who have bravely waived their right to anonymity to speak out, have told how they and their three siblings were conceived while their mum was raped and abused. McDarby was once arrested and admitted to fathering six children with Mary between  and  — but said he didn’t believe he did anything wrong. The dad, from Ballickmoyler in Co Carlow, Ireland, died more than ten years ago without ever facing any charges.    His daughters now claim no-one helped their abused mum even though she sought help on multiple occasions. Ashley, , the eldest of the three, told the Irish Sun on Sunday: She did avail of the rape crisis services, she did talk to social services and [the police] and so did her rapist, but nothing was ever done. “The legal system, the support services... are to blame.    She added: “I am really glad abortion is now allowed in Ireland particularly for cases of rape because it means my mother could have got away sooner had she decided to abort us.” Mary slept with a hammer under her pillow and was loving towards her children despite the horrors McDarby had put her through, said Ashley. She described McDarby as pure evil and along with her sisters revealed they never called him their father.  They have branded him the “Irish Josef Fritzl”, a reference to the Austrian man who held his daughter Elisabeth captive in a basement dungeon for  years while repeatedly raping her. Elisabeth gave birth to seven children before she was finally rescued. Maryaposs alcoholic mum, Mona, married McDarby a year after her businessman husband Richard died in .  Mary was just  when she became pregnant with her first child, a son, in . She became pregnant again when her son was just three months old, but she miscarried after she was raped by McDarby, then . He forced her to put the child in a bag and he buried it in a field, where the infant remains today, it was reported. The rape and physical abuse continued as McDarby moved Mary from Ardee to a house in Dublin, where she was isolated from the outside world and forced to raise her children on her own.  She gave birth to Ashley in , to Iseultin  and to Meganin . A boy born in  was adopted and Mary never saw him again. DNA testing confirmed that McDarby is the five other siblingsapos father. The sisters said their mum, then , eventually disclosed her secrets and escaped to the US with the help of a neighbour but ed after she was told her daughters had been taken into care.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum who was stunned when her doctor told her she had two vaginas has given birth to aposmiracleapos twins. Lauren Cotter had suffered from agonising menstrual cramps since she was  and was convinced she had polycystic oy syndrome , a hormonal condition affecting the way the oies work. But an ultrasound scan a year later revealed she actually had uterus didelphys, where a woman is born with two uteruses, two cervixes and, in her case, two vaginas. Now , Lauren insists her condition has never affected her sex le with her police officer husband, Ben, . But she was told she would find it very hard to carry and deliver a child because of the reduced size of her wombs and cervix.    Despite the odds against her, Lauren gave birth to Amelie, five, and Harvey, three. And in an even stranger twist of fate she now has twins Maya and Evie – who were conceived despite her being fitted with a contraceptive implant. In a further quirk of her pregnancies Lauren carried her girls in her right womb while Harvey stayed in her left. She said: From quite early, on Ben and I discussed having children and it was clear that he really wanted to be a dad. “I knew I had to be open and honest and tell him that might not be a possibility for me. Luckily he wasnapost bothered. We talked it through and agreed that there was more than one way to have a babyyou wanted it badly enough. But actually, we have found it easy to fall pregnant – I am not sure why, orit has anything to do with my two vaginas.” After starting her periods aged , Lauren soon began to suffer with painful cramps and heavy bleeding. Consulting her doctor, an ultrasound scan was performed to investigate the symptoms further when she was , revealing she had uterus didelphys.    According to the World Health Organisation, the condition affects around one in , women and occurs when the uterus fails to fuse properly during development in the womb. Lauren said: I can’t remember much about the diagnosis, but I remember hearing PCOS mentioned quite a few times. Up until the ultrasound, there were no signs that I was any dferent to anyone .” A few months after her diagnosis, Lauren had laser surgery to remove the iding wall between her two vaginas, which would enable her to enjoy a normal love le. She said: I didn’t think much about it at the time. All I remember is being told I was going to need surgery to give me a normal le later down the line - but they didnapost go into any specics. A year later, when she was , she met Ben through mutual friends and happily intimacy was no problem for the pair. With their relationship going from strength to strength, Lauren and Ben got married in a mansion house in Melbourne in  and a year into their marriage decided to start trying for a baby.    But, while fertility itself was not an issue, she had been warned that being able to safely carry a baby to full term may not be possible, given that her wombs were half the average size. So, the newlyweds were expecting the road to parenthood to be fraught with dficulties - until Lauren fell pregnant with Amelie in October  after just a month of trying. She said: We decided to give it a go, and just see what happened. We knew it might be a bumpy road and tried not to get our hopes up too much. “Just a month after we started trying, I bought a stack of pregnancy tests and started taking them weekly. Then one morning, I had a test to hand, and there on the stick was a very, very, faint blue line. I couldnapost be sure, so I took a test each morning that week, and each day the line got darker and darker until I was sure - we were pregnant. With doctors carefully monitoring her pregnancy to key an eye on the baby’s development, Lauren initially hoped she would be able to carry the baby to full term. Lauren added: My obstetrician was quite honest with me and explained that, as I have two cervixes, it physically isnapost possible for me to fully dilate enough for the baby to pass through.  “Therefore, I’d have to have an early delivery via C-section. Despite her initial disappointment, Laurenaposs pregnancy went smoothly and baby Amelie was delivered by caesarean section on June , , at Melbourne’s Mercy Hospital for Women, weighing a healthy lb oz. Settling into family le, the couple decided to start trying for baby number two around  months later. Once again, after just two months, Lauren fell pregnant and was surprised to discover at her first scan at five weeks that her baby was growing in her left womb, not her right, as before. She said: I carried Amelie in my right, and just assumed the left one was a dud. Following another problem-free pregnancy, Harvey was delivered, once again by caesarean, at  weeks. Arriving at the Mercy Hospital for Women, he weighed lb oz, and, after initially struggling to swallow on his own, was allowed home after three weeks. Already busy raising two young children, Lauren was unsureshe wanted to try again right away so,  months after having Harvey she was fitted with a contraceptive implant on the advice of her consultant.    Lauren said: The pill was giving me migraines and I couldnapost use the coil, so in the end the implant was the only option left. Itaposs one of the complexities of having my condition - they have to take two swabs every time I go for a smear test too. According to the NHS, the implant is more than  per cent effective – but remarkably, just three weeks after having it fitted, Lauren made a shocking discovery. She said: This feeling came over me, and on some level, I knew I was pregnant. The day my period was due, I dug out a pregnancy test, and within minutes my suspicions were confirmed.” Then, at her nine-week scan, Lauren, who suspects she conceived the day her implant was fitted after a misunderstanding about the window period in which she could fall pregnant afterwards, was left reeling once again when she discovered she was expecting twins. She said: Shocked doesnapost begin to cover it. During  years together, Ben and I had only ever got pregnant when we’d planned it. Now, here we were, having surprise twins. Concerned about how long Lauren would be able to carry twins due to her condition, doctors put her on strict bed rest from  weeks onward.    She said: My doctor was very honest and said he couldnapost know how the pregnancy was going to play out. Slowly ticking off the days, by the  week mark the babies were ready to be delivered and on June , , Maya and Evie were born – by caesarean like their siblings - weighing lb oz and lb oz respectively. While they initially seemed perfectly healthy, drama struck just hours after their arrival when Evie began struggling with her breathing and was sent to intensive care. There, an X-ray of her lungs was ordered, which showed she was suffering with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which occurs when a baby is born with their intestines in the chest cavity. At just five days old, she had keyhole surgery, which her parents were warned she had just a  per cent chance of surviving and could have meant her staying in hospital for up to eight months before she was ready to be discharged.

There was such a blur of goals that, at the final whistle, the referee remarked to a Harp official that ‘keeping count of the  goals was no mean feat’.“A Harp committee man said: ‘I make it  goals scored’. Waving a small notebook, he continued: ‘I counted the goals’.“The match official accepted the Harp tally and agreed to send that score to the SFA in Glasgow – Harp  Aberdeen Rovers .“A joyous Harp team and committee set out to celebrate this momentous victory at the Dundee Arms, located at the beginning of the High Street.“It was brilliant fare laid on by the tavern – tripe and tatties washed down with a fine Ballingal’s ale. Could le be any better ”As often the case when lads are together having a rare old time of it, a bit of fun wouldn’t be amiss, as Rob revealed: “It was Ex-Gayfield defender Tom O’Kane who suggested a telegram be sent to that lot in Arbroath who had given him stick when he announced his move to Harp.“A telegram was composed amidst the celebration, and it informed Arbroath FC that Harp had demolished their Aberdeen opponents by a record score of -.“This would make them sit up in Arbroath and take notice of Dundee Harp.“An hour or so later, a telegram from Arbroath arrived at the Dundee Arms addressed to the Harp committee.“When the content was read – Arbroath  Bon Accord  – there were roars of laughter from the Harp lads.“Everyone agreed, those Red Lichties have a great sense of humour.“O’Kane looked at his pocket watch and decided it was best to get movinghe was to make the last train.“With a great send-off ringing in his ears, Tom made a brisk walk to the West station and caught the last train home to the Angus town.”On the Arbroath station , the first person Tom recognised was local policeman PC Clark.Rob continued: “The player said jubilantly: ‘Constable, what about that score today, must be a record don’t you think ’“PC Clark replied: ‘It may very well be, Tom. If they hadn’t disallowed so many goals, it surely would be a record. Mind you, - is one almighty score’.“A disconcerted O’Kane feared the worst. Arbroath had really scored  goals.“Tom slept little and, at first light, he was up and out the door. The Sunday train to Dundee would be too late for Tom, he walked and jogged all the way from Arbroath to Dundee, and sought out Harp officials to confirm the Arbroath score.“Do we have time to change yesterday’s score to the ref’s tally of Harp  Aberdeen Rovers  “Tom and the committee lads then went off to the referee’s house.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/KCes_Team_Extreme_Kickboxing_Dundee_120919-22-375x564.jpg ","title":"dundee kickboxing clubs head coach says all credit must go to his talented kids","story":"Team Xtreme Kickboxing Club’s head coach Jimmy Cavanagh says all the credit must go to his talented kids for their medal success.Based in Charleston, Team Xtreme has been running for nine years and, in recent times, has seen its younger members enjoy success on the Scottish, UK, European and World stage.Cavanagh, , is an electrician by day and pours all of his free time into making his club the best it can be.However, he is keen to give the credit to his athletes and their families as they gear up for more challenges ahead.“I can’t thank the parents enough for the support they show the kids,” Cavanagh said.“The confidence in there is great.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources.

Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

This area is also very popular with families who picnic on the flat land beside the river. Haylodge Park has always been a well-manicured park and this is what makes it such a beautul place to visit and use.He questioned whether the plans had been ldquoproperly thought through given that such meadows require upkeep and maintenance.He added: ldquoThese proposals seek to change the very nature of Haylodge Park which is central to recreational le in Peebles.ldquoThe intention to increase bioersity is a noble one, but where needs to be carefully considered.ldquoThe areas identied are heavily used, particularly along the waterrsquos edge and, in my view, should not change.

We have to look at new ways of improving our public spaces, for the benefit of all, including our wildle.Councillor Stuart Bellsaid he welcomed the introduction of bioersity but warned that the council must be wary of making changes simply to save money.He added: ldquoIrsquove seen the introduction of bioersity areas in other parts of the Borders and these do need on-going and specialist care and attention or they just become an unsightly mess of weeds.I trust that the councilrsquos neighbourhood services team have the skills to manage the changes."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, is a bonded pair of rabbits called Mfy and Boo.The charity told us: \"Mfy is a seven-year-old neutered brown girl and Boo is a two-year-old black and white boy.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule.

Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":null,"title":"dear-children-thank-39-re-sorry-voices-climate-strike","story":"Esther Silverton, , EdinburghThe biggest dference from when I did my first strike at the beginning of February to now is how people view the issue. When we started the strikes,I look back at my first speech, it was all about how we need to wake up the world. No one was talking about climate change. Now what wersquore saying is that the world knows and now we need to act.To me the first step to changing everything is awareness. Itrsquos a really huge thing and powerful. I do feel itrsquos working. Everybody knows that climate change is a thing now, and itrsquos an actual issue that will affect us. Before, it was like, ldquoYeah, I need to turn off the lights to save the polar bears. Now people we leaflet to in the street will say, ldquoYes, I get why you are doing this, eventhey donrsquot agree with it. Thatrsquos probably the biggest indication that itrsquos working.I think itrsquos kids that are doing this because we havenrsquot been swayed by normal society as much. As soon as you get a job and go into normal le you do what you do to get by, whereas wersquore still in a place where we can try things like striking and do as much as we can. We can imagine something dferent and a world that isnrsquot shaped as much.Finlay Pringle, , UllapoolThis is my fortieth climate strike. When I was younger I always had a fascination with the ocean and that was reaffirmed when I went snorkelling with my parents. I realised it was beautul, and this beautul place needed protecting.I felt pretty angry that we as human beings were destroying that incredible place ndash whether it be through plastic pollution or climate change. So I decided, with my sister, that we were going to start climate striking on December . We believe we were the first in the UK. Back then there was no Extinction Rebellion in our area, no Scottish Youth Climate Strikes. So we got in contact with Fridays for Future, the organisation that Greta set up. It grew from there.It angers me that we as human beings have let it get this bad. We were being told back when it was black and white TV that there was such a thing as climate change. What did we do  We just pretended it didnrsquot exist. Itrsquos human nature to leave everything to the very last minute. If we do that with climate change there will be no stopping it.I would like our governments to actually do something. Politicians can say climate emergency, but what does it actually mean  We need radical action. We need net zero by . Wersquove got till  to turn this ship around. If we donrsquot reach that deadline then the world is basically doomed. And I hate to put it like that because Irsquom usually quite optimistic.I find it shocking that people my age donrsquot think that climate change is real. It is the greatest threat that we as humanity have ever faced. I read books, IPCC reports, online articles. Because we know the stuff, we become the teachers and we teach everyone . I feel like we as climate strikers have almost a role to educate. We shouldnrsquot be having to do this. It should be the government. But currently it is us ndash and we can educate people about the climate crisis and about some of the small things they can do.Martine Miller, parent, EdinburghIrsquove become more and more educated recently about climate change and what our future is going to look like. Irsquove got a daughter who is three years old and Irsquom terried about what world shersquos going to inherit ndash and not even in that far off distance. Becoming a parent just really brought it home to me. The young people have really galvanised support for the issue and raised awareness. This is my first climate protest. Irsquove not been on any sort of protest before. Everything wersquove done so far has just been at an inidual level, making small changes at home.Charlotte Muller-Stuart, , PeeblesItrsquos insane how much the strike has progressed. When we first started it was literally just  of us including a few friends from Peebles that I managed to drag up to Edinburgh. Now its tens of thousands. I do think people are starting to listen. I think therersquos not enough panic though. Irsquove found that quite a lot of the time with the politicians, they will secretly tell us, ldquoI shouldnrsquot be saying this but I think itrsquos really good that yoursquore striking. They just think itrsquos good that wersquore getting involved in activism and that wersquore having a political say.Quite a lot of the debate about the strikes is more about the action of us striking rather than what wersquore actually trying to say and the reasons why wersquore striking.There is also still so much that our government can do in Scotland that they arenrsquot doing right now. Things like more peatland restoration.People take it far more seriously when kids go out on strike rather than adults protesting because when adults do it, it comes off as hippyish. Itrsquos not taken as seriously as children sacricing their education and making this statement that says, lsquoWhy should we go to schoolwersquore not going to have a future rsquoI think itrsquos really important not just to educate the youth, but also to educate the adults. People know about climate change but they donrsquot know the scale of the problem. I think so many adults are in denial about it. I think they donrsquot want to acknowledge it. Also there are quite a lot of adults that donrsquot know about it as well. In March I asked five teachersany of them had heard of the IPCC report and all of them said that they hadnrsquot.Mike Shepherd, retired petroleum geologist and author of Oil Strike North SeaOur city streets echo with youngsters campaigning for action on climate change youngsters who care passionately about the future of our planet. The environmental groups that support them insist that Big Oil must be shut down to prevent further global warming. It all seems very worthy, and herersquos my opinion: they are distracting us from the real problem.Donrsquot get me wrong here ndash climate change is all too real and will cause dficulties in the decades to come. My grouse with the protests is that they drown out the discussion that should be taking place instead.The world population of humans are increasingly city dwellers. In the UK almost  per cent of us inhabit the urban landscape. Our food is produced by farmers with their diesel-fuelled tractors the food they harvest is then transported to our shops by diesel-fuelled lorries. Electric tractors and lorries do exist but are not common yet.The climate protestors should note that oil as a fuel must not be phased out until alternative methods of fuelling tractors and lorries are in place and can be shown to cope with the challenge of feeding our huge urban population. Get this one wrong and billions will starve - itrsquos that serious.Step back to  when the world population was . billion. The global economy had been recovering from the recent war, and received a boost when huge oil fields were brought on stream in the Middle East and North Africa. Cheap energy fuelled a humongous increase in human activity lsquothe great accelerationrsquo academics call it.From  to now, humans, particularly in the affluent west, have seen a substantial change to their standard of living.During this time the world avoided major famines, not the least because of the lsquoGreen Revolutionrsquo in the s when wheat and rice yields increased substantially. In consequence, the world population has increased to over . billion today. Thatrsquos an extra five billion people since . Cheap oil is responsible for underpinning this huge population increase. If oil runs out and nothing takes its place, the props fall away . Plan A is thus to replace oil with alternative energy sources as a priority. We have to.Dylan Hamilton, , LinlithgowOne analogy I use to explain why young people are pushing this is the boiled frog. If you put a frog in a pot of water and slowly heat up the temperature the frog will boil and die. Butyou put a frog into already boiling water, it will immediately jump out. So the boiled frog represents the grown up, but the young people are the frog that jumps out. The dference is wersquore tied to the boiled frog andwe all donrsquot act then we all die.Irsquove been striking weekly since February . I met Greta in August in Switzerland. What struck me was that she is a really down to earth person. I was on crutches at the time and she was the only person in the entire room that helped me carry my food.The things Irsquove learned over the past eight months are actually less to do with climate change and more to do with society ndash the little political tricks, how to talk to politicians. I think wersquore having an impact on how politicians think. Every time they make a policy, wersquore in the back of their minds. Nicola Sturgeon declared a climate emergency and the Greens have said wersquove given them momentum to push harder because they can say wersquove got tens of thousands of young people pushing for this as well. Scotland likes to claim that theyrsquore a world leader andthis is threatening their status as a world leader, theyrsquoll try to keep up the the good profile. Not quite enough is being done but itrsquos better than it was.Obviously what I want from these strikes is for us to stop the emissions of greenhouse gases. But more specically what I think they could do is implement a Green New Deal. So we would become a renewable and completely sustainable society ndash because at the moment our system isnrsquot built to be sustainable and renewable. We use the term Just Transition a lot. We would have to have a Just Transition to get jobs in renewables so people wouldnrsquot be out of work. Everything would have to be renewable and not killing the earth.Hilary Brown, marketing manager, EdinburghAlthough I am a politically aware person and have marched many times over the years, it is fair to say that my daughterrsquos concern about climate crisis and her much repeated plea, \"Wersquove just  years to stop climate change before itrsquos too late\" led me to commit to joining the global strike. I should have been working, but made a very last minute decision to walk away from it and support the strike. She and her friends have attended some the Friday climate strikes and I am proud of their commitment to raising the urgency of the climate emergency as a political priority. I also find it demands a personal response from me. Younger people are understandably able to focus on the immediate threat posed by climate emergency and donrsquot hedge their bets in terms of what needs to be done about it. There are so many lsquoah butsrsquo and lsquowhat srsquo that plague any debate for politicians and that stop people from committing to radical change. I have very valid distractions plus a degree of complacency and,Irsquom honest, cynicism about the ability to make change happen. I find that the young climate strikers are bringing clarity to the issue and making me acknowledge the need for urgent and sustained action. I am blown away by Greta Thunberg ndash how well informed she is and the way she articulates the reality of the situation facing the world ndash not in her first language either! I donrsquot really like the generational blame game. Many people my age and older have marched and campaigned all their lives and won many rights. They have made the world a better place for all of us lucky enough to claim those rights. But I do understand the anger young people feel about the future they face. Itrsquos not so much that they are more aware of the issue than their elders. We are all well aware. The dference is their sense of urgency about doing the things needed to tackle it. I find there is less and less excuse for me, as a person with dependents and a whole iety of responsibilities, not to make this as much of a priority as they do."},{"url":null,"title":"39-re-gloomed-cope-times-eco-anxiety","story":"ldquoI was thinking way more about humans rather than nature. Only recently have I been more connected with the environment. Irsquove realised that this is way bigger than just the humans. The fact that nature is being exploited and destroyed right now ndash thatrsquos the bit that stresses me out most.Stress is just one of the feelings she and other young people experience around climate change. Fridayrsquos mass climate strike in the September sunshine, a riot of colour and noise, looked on so many levels like a flowering of positivity. But the words used by the young people out that day do not come from the spectrum of joy.They were, naturally given the scale of the issue, ldquoangry, ldquoterried, ldquoscared, ldquoworried. In the same week, the United Nations Childrenrsquos Fund warned that the biggest emerging threats to children globally, are ldquothe worsening climate crisis, a decline in mental health and online misinformation.What do we do with the fact that this generation, already troubled in terms of mental health, is now having to process chilling facts about the future of our planet and humanityrsquos role  How do those of us who are parents, or adults connected to children, work through this with our youngsters, who are now coming across this information at sometimes a very young age As Caroline Hickman, a psychotherapist working with the University of Bath and the Climate Psychology Alliance, points out, adults too are having many ldquocomplicated feelings around the climate emergency. ldquoBut theyrsquore also thinking, how can I cope with my childrenrsquos feelings  How can I support my grandchildren Sometimes these feelings are described as eco-anxiety, a current buzzword, as Hickman observes, an inadequate descriptor for the full range of emotions around climate crisis.ldquoAnxiety is the gateway in, but then people go through a whole process of emotions ndash depression, despair, frustration, among young people, that adults arenrsquot doing something, and hopelessness, and blaming.Scottish climate-strikers will frequently mention eco-anxiety. One, -year-old Dylan Hamilton, says there are times when he has felt ldquoreally down. ldquoIrsquove never felt like giving up. But I struggle a lot because I also have chronic fatigue, so it makes everything ten times more dficult. I have to constantly keep up and be on top of my learning. That can be really stressful and Irsquove had a few burn outs, but I never stop striking.Dylan first started to question how we were behaving around the environment when he was eight. ldquoI was in the eco committee at school, he recalls, ldquobut I got really fed up because it felt like all we were doing was taking out the bins. I feltit is as serious as yoursquore telling me then we should be doing more than just taking out the bins. That, he says, triggered a mental state of ldquohopelessness for a while.However, he says, striking has helped hugely. ldquoI feel like Irsquom doing enough, which has really helped my mental state. Wersquore actually a really supportive group because we all get each otherrsquos problems and wersquove got loads of people we can turn toit is stressing us out.But these youth activists are not the only young people to have been impacted our current wave of climate crisis stories. All children are. Few can have escaped hearing the news that the earth is warming, the ice caps melting, the polar bears threatened, and plastic is everywhere.In this context how we talk to our children about it becomes crucial. Over the past year, it has become a question for me. How much do I share, as I cover climate related issues, of both the information and my own rollercoaster feelings, with my sons aged  and  Hickman believes that talking is the most important thing we need to do with our children. She recalls how six months ago she interviewed an eight-year-old in a bid to find out how might be best to talk to youngsters. She said to her, ldquoOkay Sophia, I want to talk to you about some scary things ndash climate change ndash but I want to find a way to do that that doesnrsquot terry and overwhelm you. What would you suggest we do Sophiarsquos reply, she says, is something she often quotes. She said: ldquoThe thing is, it is dficult, but you must tell me the truth. Andyou donrsquot tell me the truth yoursquore lying to me ndash and Irsquom not a baby.ldquoI loved the way she put that, says Hickman. ldquoShersquos spot on. We mustnrsquot treat them like theyrsquore babies. They do need to be prepared for the realities of these things. But a parent needs to be able to process their own feelings a little bit to talk to the child. They need to have taken a little bit of time and thought, well how do I feel  How upset am I  Whatrsquos getting in the way of me talking to my child  Irsquove talked to a few children about this and they saidyou donrsquot talk to us, we feel abandoned.In , The Mental Health Foundation published a poll of parents exploring how, in an era of -hour news and social media, they felt their children were responding to larger world events andthey were able to adequately discuss the issues with their children. Around a third of parents said their children were anxious around global warming and climate change.Off the back of their poll, they published some advice, which, they suggest, might be relevant to parents concerned about how they handle their childrenrsquos exposure to climate crisis news. ldquoThe advice that wersquove developed, says Julie Cameron, head of programmes at The Mental Health Foundation Scotland, ldquois that trying to have a news black-out and shield your children isnrsquot helpful. Likewise, of course, neither is extreme over-exposure.Cameron suggests taking time to watch the news with your child, particularly an age-appropriate show like Newsround, and making sure that there is plenty of opportunity for conversation following it. ldquoItrsquos taking the time to explore this with them. Itrsquos okay to acknowledge that this is quite scary and tricky stuff and that none of us have complete control over it. You also need to reassure them that itrsquos okay and in their day-to-day le they are safe. Amongst their advice too is that itrsquos good for adult mental health to get ldquocivically involved. ldquoThis is probably applicable to children too. We say become civically active, become engaged.That activism can be good for mental health is something that Hickman echoes. Itrsquos also a frequent reflection from those young people who are deeply involved in the climate strike. ldquoStriking helps me deal with it, says Muller-Stuart. ldquoItrsquos definitely empowering. Because otherwise you can feel so helpless ndash like yoursquore the only one. You go to a global strike where there are thousands of other people and itrsquos more empowering and it makes you think itrsquos not just you. Therersquos a lot more hope. Another emotion that climate strikers frequently express is anger ndash often at the older generations. As John Thorne, secretary for Climate Psychology Alliance Scotland notes, ldquoIf yoursquore , yoursquove done very little to cause this issue, and yoursquove got a total right to be angry about it and thatrsquos a good thing. Because being angry and upset means we do something.But it would be wrong to paint a picture of a modern world ided into adults who are in denial and young people who are the truth speakers and sufferers of eco anxiety. Itrsquos not quite like that. Many adults in the environmental and other radical movements, or working in renewables, or researching related science, have been trying to address this issue for a very long time. Adults get despair too ndash and grief, and another more hampering emotion, guilt.Another problem, Hickman says, parents find, in dealing with their childrenrsquos climate-related distress, is that there is nothing in their personal histories to relate the current crisis to. ldquoIf your child comes home upset because of bullying, as a parent you can call on your own experience of dealing with those problems. But we havenrsquot got our own history of dealing with this.Of course, all of us will recall some global or national threat from our own childhood: the nuclear threat, HIV Aids. Hickman believes this is not quite the same. ldquoWhat makes this subtly dferent is the fact that wersquore all culpable for this, even through the small decisions we make. There is also a great deal of uncertainty attached to it. It may be man-made, but itrsquos not in our control ndash we donrsquot know when the tipping points will be. That makes us utterly vulnerable and hugely aware of our dependency on our environment.These are things I hear echoed by many young people. They are acutely aware of their own impacts, yet at the same time of their smallness in relation to the problem. ldquoItrsquos so big, says Charlotte Muller-Stuart, ldquoand therersquos so much. Itrsquos also hard to switch off from. You canrsquot really brush it off. Everything that you do, every single day, is somehow affecting the environment in some way.We are lucky, in this country, to be, as yet, relatively little impacted by climate change. This makes it easier to comfort our children, tell them they are currently safe. Thatrsquos not the case for all children. Hickman has also interviewed children in the Males, who are on the frontline of sea-level rises. ldquoThe children there, she observes, ldquoare saying itrsquos happening now. They said to me, lsquoPeople in Iceland had a funeral for a glacier, we watched it online ndash wherersquos our funeral  Who is going to care about us rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"Labour s self-destructing Brexit policy     negotiate and reject     is incoherence on stilts","story":"Labour are of course correct that the Liberal Democrats have made a nonsense of their own party name by refusing to recognise the democratic vote for Brexit in . Of course, I sympathise. I would revoke Article  tomorrow,I had the choice. But you simply cant tell people that their vote in a referendum is to be ignored, cast aside, because they werent clever enough to understand what they were voting for.UK voters were promised in  that their decision would be honoured, not least in the millions of government leaflets put through their doors. The LibDems claim to be the great champions of civil liberties and human rights, yet they are prepared to abandon the most important right of all: the right to vote.We now know what would have happened in Scotland had voted for independence. The Liberal Democrats, who were in government at the time with the Tories, would simply have just rejected it. Impossible to implement. Scots didnt know what they were voting for. Chaos wasnt on the ballot paper.So the LibDems have made an egregious error, but this doesnt mean that Labours policy is much better. It is marginally more democratic, at least in offering voters a choice. But what a choice.Jeremy Corbyn says that he will negotiate a new and better Brexit than the Tories. Britain would remain in the EU Customs Union with the closest possible alignment with the European Single Market. Britain would retain all the work place and environmental protections that Theresa May offered to add to her Withdrawal Agreement that Labour rejected.Under Labours plan the UK would therefore remain under the rules of the single market, overseen by the European Court of Justice, and would have all trade policy set by Brussels. Now, Im not knocking this. It is essentially the Norway option of remaining in the European Economic Area that was rejected by parliament in March. However, just how would this look to a Brexit voter Labour is proposing to put Remain and their Norway Plus as the only choices in their Final Say referendum. But is that really a choice  It sounds like Remain v Leave-in-name-only. Thinking back to the Scottish vote, it would be like holding an independence referendum in which the choices were: Remain in the UK versus Federalism. That would have been condemned, rightly, because independence supporters were denied any say.I am a supporter of remaining in the European Union. I have long argued that the Norway option is the obvious compromise. But it seems to me inconceivable that a referendum on leaving the European Union could exclude the option of, er, leaving the European Union. What are they thinking The trouble with both Labour and the Liberal Democrats is that theyrsquore talking to themselves. Brainwashed by their social media feeds, they think that Brexiteers are a species of bigots who dont deserve to have the vote at all. Some academics have actually said that there should be an educational qualication before people are allowed to vote.But this isnt the worst of Labours Brexit policy. Mr Corbyn first has to negotiate his ldquocredible Leave option\", a bespoke deal that allows the UK to have all the benefits of membership of the European Single Market without actually being a formal member of it. But Labours Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, and the Shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry, say theyll campaign for Remain in the Final Say, against their own partyrsquos policy.What is Brussels going to say  Well, Mr Corbyn, we really dont see why we should be bending over backwards, sideways and upside down in order to offer a deal that your lot are going to reject in a referendum. Thank you for coming.If Labour get a deal that meets all their criteria on jobs, environment, trade, free movement etc, so why on earth would they vote against their own negotiating triumph, their own policy  ldquoWe the Labour Party have reached an agreement with the European Union that gives us everything we asked for, so we are going to reject this disgraceful sell-out.Not so much a Final Say as Famous Last Words. No wonder Fiona Bruce was confused on Question Time. This incoherence explains why Labour has been overtaken by the Liberal Democrats in the latest YouGov opinion poll.The opposition have lost the plot on Brexit. Its not a good look when political parties make fools of themselves. Im almost tempted to say: come back Theresa May, all is forgiven. Perhaps the Labour MP, Stephen Kinnock, is right: Labour should have voted for Mays compromise, or at the very least abstained, when they had the chance.Her Withdrawal Agreement is the best that Brussels was prepared to offer, and she conceded quite a lot to Labour on employment rights and the environment. The UK was going to be allowed to remain, effectively, in the single market and customs union until a new trade deal was negotiated. The idea that the EU would offer more to Jeremy Corbyn, only for his party to reject it, is for the birds.Boris Johnson is clearly going to bring back a version of Mays Withdrawal Agreement, sans the Irish Backstop, even though it was rejected three times in parliament. And yes, I know it wasnt rejected solely over the backstop, but times change. Anyway, there will still be a backstop, only it will have moved to the Irish Sea in Boriss cunning plan. But parliament is going to have to take a good look at itself when this is put before MPs on October .The Benn Act, that compels the government to avoid no-deal, will surely be null and voidparliament rejects the only deal on offer. The only certainty then will be Article , which triggers Britains departure from the European Union whether or not there is a deal. MPs voted by a majority of  to trigger Article  in . They have voted down every alternative since then.I dont actually believe that Boris Johnson wants a crash-out Brexit: he is proud that he has managed to get movement from Brussels. But make no mistake. If parliament continues to preicate, and fails to come up with a majority for any kind of compromise, then Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on October . It is irresponsible to demand a further extension of Ait is to no purpose.It sickens me to say it, but there is a half-decent Brexit deal on offer and MPs will have to think very carefully before rejecting it. The alternative will not be revoking A, or a referendum, both of which have been rejected by MPs. The alternative will be a hard-right Brexit. And parliament will be as much to blame as Boris Johnson."},{"url":null,"title":"leonard-demands-39-clarity-39-uk-labour-leadership-39-s-brexit-stance","story":"The Scottish Labour leader, at the party conference in Brighton, praised Jeremy Corbyns leadership but made clear he would support the UK party taking a Remain stance.His intervention came as Mark Drakeford, his Welsh Labour counterpart, also set out his stall on Sunday morning for a campaign to Remain, claiming up to , jobs could be lost in Wales by a \"crash-out Brexit\".Speaking on the BBCs Sunday Politics Scotland programme, Mr Leonard outlined the decision made by the Scottish executive to bring any deal decision back to the public.\"The Scottish Labour party took a decision frankly in the wake of the European party election results that we needed to be much clearer, that we needed much greater clarity about the position that we were taking.\"For that reason the Scottish executive of the Labour Party backed my proposal that we call for an affirmative vote that any deal should go back to the public secondly, that on that vote there should be a Remain option and thirdly, that we would campaign unambiguously for Remain.\"I would support the party taking that stance. I do think the time has come for clarity on this question and the Scottish Labour Party, the Welsh Labour Party take a similar view that we should be more overtly Remain.\"But the key thing where we are in the chronology of Brexit is that Jeremy Corbyns leadership has forced Boris Johnson into a position where hes got no mandate for his position of a no-deal Brexit and hes also embraced the idea and said categorically that Labour would put any deal back to the people.\"Mr Leonard also threw his support behind Mr Corbyn, who earlier on Sunday vowed to serve a full term as Prime Ministerthe party won the next General Election.He added: \"Jeremy Corbyn has been extremely strong in his leadership in getting the opposition parties to get together and block the Boris Johnson no-deal Brexit plan. Well need to see whether Boris Johnson abides by that decision of Parliament and that law.\"It gets into very interesting territory where there is a prime minister, who has got no mandate as Prime Minister for his government, who is standing on a policy which is in effect no-deal Brexit, for which there is no mandate either.\"The position is that weve said we want to put any deal back to the people and weve said in doing that we want a Remain option to be on the ballot paper but there would by the same token be a Leave option on the ballot paper too.\"I guess the question is around what form that Leave option would take and so theres been discussion about what the red lines of a Labour government negotiation with the EU would be.\"Mandates came into question again when the MSP was also asked about another Scottish independence referendum.Mr Leonard was previously been against the idea but has come into line with Mr Corbyns position that it would not completely be off the table after a few years of a Labour government.He said: \"The Labour position going into the General Election, whenever it comes, will be that we oppose the creation of a separate Scottish state, that we oppose independence and, therefore, that we oppose the holding of a second independence referendum.\"Where there has been some discussion is aroundthere was to be a renewed mandate which showed not only electoral but demonstrable public support for the holding of a second referendum, then there would need to be some consideration given to that.\"We had an independence referendum just five years ago and thats got to be a factor in considering whether the circumstances are right for a second independence referendum to be held.\"All of the evidence shows that even people who voted Yes in , even some people who are supporting the SNP, do not think that the time is now for a second independence referendum.The party leader noted the circumstances under which the  referendum came about after the SNP had gained an ldquounprecedented, completely unexpected overall majority.\"What Im saying is I dont see the circumstances today and I dont see them in the foreseeable future where we would be back[another poll] in that kind of space again,\" added Mr Leonard."},{"url":null,"title":"politics-watch-perils-beside-seaside","story":"The change of location ought to be a boon for the Sunday shows. No more studio bound interviews across a desk begone the politician standing in front of a bog standard garden trellis. But going out of a controlled environment has its risks, as The Andrew Marr Show demonstrated.: Corbyn calls for recallMarr is a ldquobig window show, the window in question containing a live shot of the Thames. Through it we can see the subdued bustle of a Sunday morning in London, trains going to and from Waterloo, boats chugging through the water at sightseeing speed. There is no sound, because that would interfere with what is being said, which is, after all, why we are all here on a Sunday morning.Marr took the window idea to Brighton, which seemed at first like a smart move. We could see a pier, lots of expensive flats along the waterside , and a beach complete with strollers and joggers. The problem was what we could hear. Ladies and gentlemen, all the way from London, it was the artist known as Shouting Man.Shouting Man, with his trademark ldquoStop Brexit bellow, can be heard in the background to almost every interview on Westminsterrsquos College Green. He is not the same as Glockenspiel Man, Liberty Bell Man, Drum Man, or any of the other characters who like to express their political opinions through the medium of music.Shouting Man gave viewers a brief burst from his limited repertoire, then went quiet for a bit. He might have been having a cup of tea and a bacon roll, he could have been doing an interview , or a researcher had popped down to plead with him. But soon he was back, in full flow. Marr and Corbyn were determined to ignore him, but it was a struggle, for them as much for the viewer.: Cameron cites frustration with SalmondMarr ploughed on, asking the Labour leader about attempts to oust Tom Watson as his deputy. Corbyn said he knew there were to be discussions but was not aware a motion was being put forward. ldquoIrsquom not all seeing and all knowing. Irsquod love to be.What about the departure of a key aide, Andrew Fisher, as reported in the Sunday Times  He was said to have walked out claiming Corbyn could not win a General Election, and accusing his leadership team of a ldquolack of professionalism, competence and decency. That was all fine, too, said Corbyn. Why, they had enjoyed a cup of coffee together that morning. He even tried a joke, saying of Mr Fisher: ldquoWe do frequently argue ... about football. He supports Spurs. Stand-ups everywhere relax: you are never going to lose a gig to Jezza the Joker.Attempts were made to discover which side Mr Corbyn would be on in any referendum on a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal, all to no avail. As for his staying a full term as PM, the answer was a spirited ldquoof course.Ridge on Sunday opted to set up shop in the exhibitors section of The Brighton Centre.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted.

This year Orkney boasts seven venues — some of which are participating for the first time,As far as local people are concerned, Doors Open Days is about getting into buildings for free and seeing things that you don#t often see. If buildings are usually charging an entrance fee they can take part by offering to open for free,The event benefits the organisations or venues by attracting more visitors. It helps them by becoming more involved in the community, as a volunteer or a visitor, and enhancing appreciation of local architecture and local heritage.The seven venues taking part in Orkney all have free entry.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And so surely it is both appropriate and welcome that it seeks to make its expertise and experience available to those trying to save lives in other countries, and supports those efforts where they can “Much of the work the RNLI is doing overseas appears to be targeted at young people and children – helping making the water safer for them # and that is something I would fully support.“As someone who has, from a very early age, helped raise funds for the RNLI, I am proud of its work home and abroad, and I thank every crew member, volunteer, fundraiser and supporter for all their efforts.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If we don’t, I’m fearful for the result of the general election.”Trade unions polled voters earlier this year on Labour’s current policy of putting a new Brexit deal it negotiates to a referendum, with Remain on the ballot paper but with Labour going into a general election without a clear stance on which option it would campaign for.Across the UK, only . per cent of  Labour voters would stick with the party under those circumstances. The Lib Dems would take  per cent of the  Labour vote, with . per cent going to the Greens, . per cent to the SNP, and . per cent to Plaid Cymru.That compares with  per cent going to the Brexit Party and  per cent to the Conservatives.The figures are even worse in Scotland, where just . per cent of  Labour voters would stick with the party. The SNP would take a fth of Labour’s vote at the last election, with % going to the Lib Dems, % to the Brexit Party, and % to the Conservatives.Ms Thornberry insisted her comments were not part of a leadership bid amid growing speculation about a fresh challenge to Mr Corbyn’s authority.“In a polarised situation like this, it’s absolutely right to keep the country together, which is what a second referendum does in my view, but we’ve got to be honest about who we are - and we’re internationalists and Europeans,” Ms Thornberry added.: Concerns no-deal Brexit could fuel sectarian violence in Scotland “I know that the scottish Labour Party agreed with me, and I know that the Welsh Labour Party agree with me.“There are so many marginal seats in Scotland. I hear the stats and my heart misses a beat, because I was first elected on a majority of .“There are lots of seats that are really marginal on all sides, which is why it’s so important that we are clear.”Ms Thornberry’s intervention follows a call from Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard for the UK party to follow policy set north of the border and in Wales, backing Remain in the event of a second EU referendum.Mr Corbyn is under pressure ahead of a vote of members in Brighton tomorrow, after he said he would “go along with whatever decision the party comes to” at a special conference to decide Labour’s stance in a referendum.Pressure was also heaped on the Labour leader by the London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, who told a fringe event in Brighton: “Staying neutral in the face of the biggest economic and social threat to our country for decades is simply not an option.”Mr Corbyn defended his ‘neutral’ stance and promised a special Labour conference for party members to decide whether to endorse a new Brexit deal his government would negotiate, or back Remaining in the EU.“What we have said is that we would want to hold a consultation, a special conference of our party at the point that we have got this offer from the EU, we’ve got this as a remain - and hopefully reform - option,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.“Because I do think even those that are strongly in favour of remain would recognise the EU needs to have some reforms.”The Labour leader said he would “go along with whatever decision the party comes to” on Brexit, and did not rule out giving Labour MPs a free voteBoris Johnson brings a deal back to the Commons.Mr Corbyn risked angering Labour’s pro-EU membership by suggesting the UK could be better off after Brexit, with the right deal.“Please remember why people voted Leave, why people voted Remain, but also remember there is more that unites all of those people – over austerity, over investment, over education, over housing, over health, over a green industrial revolution – than there is that ides them,” he said.Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said the comments show Mr Corbyn “can’t lead his own party”.“Jeremy Corbyn this morning refused nine times to sayLabour would support Brexit eventhey negotiated a deal with the EU themselves, showing Labour offer nothing but dither and pointless delay,” Mr Cleverly said. “Jeremy Corbyn can’t lead his own party, let alone the country – he can’t even make up his mind on the most important issue facing the country.“He would delay Brexit until at least  and even longerthe EU demand it – Brussels would be in the driving seat and Corbyn would accept anything from them.”Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake, whose party has pledged to revoke Article it forms a majority government, said: “Jeremy Corbyn has once again refused to deny thathe becomes Prime Minister his government will be a Brexit government.“This will be deeply concerning to millions of Labour supporters who want to campaign to stop Brexit and cannot get any clarity from Labour.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm brexit policy labour should give its eyeteeth for","story":"To the growing list of senior politicians who appear to have completely lost their minds over Brexit, we must now add the name Emily Thornberry.Labour’s shadow foreign secretary has added considerably to the black farce of the current political crisis with her take on the Liberal Democrats’ announcement that they would, in the unlikely event of them winning the next general election, simply cancel the UK’s departure from the EU. This policy, says Thornberry, shows the Lib Dems are “kind of Taliban”.By any measure, this is an idiotic take. But this is where we are. This is how low Labour has sunk under the pitul leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.Thornberry’s remarks to The House magazine came after Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said thatshe became prime minister before the Brexit deed was done, her government would revoke Article . The Labour frontbencher was not alone in reacting furiously to this position. From across the political spectrum came howls of anger. The Lib Dems were undemocratic, they were prepared to treat the electorate with contempt.For sure, in these ided times, they are plenty of voters ready to lap up these attacks on Swinson. But polls published in the aftermath of the row over the policy showed that others are not quite so furiously angry. One showed the Lib Dems in second place behind Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party while other had them just a point behind Labour.If it was running candidates in the next UK general election, the Taliban would kill for polling results like those.Of course, people who cling to the belief that Brexit will mean a great national liberation are not going to like Swinson’s policy. Of course, they are going to attack it. But it is not, no matter how loudly they screech, undemocratic.In order for the Lib Dems to be able to revoke Article  and stop Brexit in its tracks, the party would have to win a majority at the next general election. Swinson would require a democratic mandate to do what she wants. How depressing that this perfectly obvious fact is ignored by the likes of Thornberry.In Scotland, we have more experience than our neighbours on these islands of living through the aftermath of a binary referendum. We understand how referendums can impact on subsequent voter behaviour. Following the  independence referendum, the SNP received a considerable boost to its electoral fortunes. Anyone who’d voted Yes in the referendum wasn’t about to back Labour or the Conservatives, were they But the nationalists weren’t the only ones to turn the result of the referendum to their advantage. Under Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tories styled themselves the defenders of the Union. While Labour squirmed and wobbled on the constitutional question, Davidson was unequivocal that a vote for her party was a vote to prevent a second independence referendum.In the  Holyrood election, the Conservatives knocked Labour into third place.The Lib Dems’ position on Brexit makes perfect political sense to me.While career-long Eurosceptic Jeremy Corbyn refuses, against the wishes of the majority of his party members, to take a firm anti-Brexit position, Swinson has the space to become the champion of those who believe that departure from the EU will have catastrophic consequences.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is now fighting for Brexit at any cost. He would rather “die in a ditch” than ask the EU to postpone our departure date of  October.Idiots and the terminally naive may believe that such a clear position can be defeated by nuance . It cannot.Brexit dominates our politics and ides the electorate. There is no mileage to be gained by opposition parties in trying to win over those now rallying around Johnson’s No Deal flag. Rather, the prize – the only prize currently on offer – is becoming the leading opponent to Johnson’s Brexit “plan”.Labour is currently bogged down in yet another crisis of its own making. A now abandoned plot to abolish the position of deputy leader in order to punish the current holder of the position, Tom Watson, for daring to speak out about issues such as anti-Semitism and Brexit is yet more proof that Corbyn and his cronies are more interested in leftist sectarianism than they are in providing credible opposition to the Conservative Party.Those Labour members who continue to delude themselves that their leader might be a viable champion for their pro-EU beliefs should seek out online an interview conducted by ITV journalist Joe Pike last week, during which Corbyn refused eight times to answer the simple question of whether he was pro-Leave or pro-Remain.Swinson’s position on Brexit is bluntand, I think, stands a good chance of capturing the mood of a great many voters. Davidson has shown that, when it comes to binary matters, it is best to pick a side and then stick to it.The chances of the Lib Dems ever being in a position to enact this new flagship policy are, it has to be said, slender. Recent polling might have the party neck and neck with Labour but Boris Johnson’s Tories continue to be the clear front-runners with voters.But, given the Lib Dems were all but destroyed by a voter backlash against their five years in coalition government with David Cameron’s Tories, being able to revoke Article  is not the only prize for Swinson. The revitalisation of her party would be quite the achievement.Politicians from left to right may insist that what voters want is for Brexit to be over and done and for MPs toto dealing with the domestic agenda. I wonderthere’s a degree of projection in such remarks.So far as I can see, Brexit shows no sign of becoming less important to the electorate. And while this is so, Swinson is quite right to take a hard Remain position.

Is that an own goal, a cunning plan or a statement of the blindingly obvious  The First Minister was speaking in Berlin last week where she collected a media prize as the “voice of reason” on Brexit. She was asked by a Czech reporter: “If the Scottish people decide for independence, could there be [another] referendum in a few years to decide against independence Nicola Sturgeon replied: “Democracy’s not conditional. It’s not for politicians to decide the limits. It’s up to people to decide the future they want. But no country, to my knowledge, that has become independent from the UK… [has] decided to change their minds and go back the way, and I don’t think it is likely that Scotland would do that either.”Quite. Indeed, the First Minister could have gone further. No country that’s become independent anywhere in the world, has gone back to the “mother ship”, cap in hand, pleading for readmission – partly because Mother Ships also move on.So, the prospect of a post-independence wobble here is unlikely, but arises from Scotland’s unique status as the only country to hold an independence referendum yet fail to jump ship. That result and its contested aftermath make it easier to suggest Scots are uniquely incapable of making a big constitutional decision and sticking with it. But devolution is irretrievably in with the bricks, despite needing two referendums to get over the line.And by the time Scotland becomes independent, rUK may very well be grappling with the reality of Brexit, a battered currency, civil unrest over food shortages and problems with medical supplies. Of course, Britain’s Brexit path may be less rocky than predicted and Scotland’s route to independence more dficult. But that’s the point. There are unknowns now on both sides of the equation.So maybe that’s why Nicola Sturgeon was prepared to indulge not smack down or body-swerve the dficult but also fairly irrelevant press conference question about indyref. Once out of the UK, an independent Scotland will be focused and busy – re-joining the EU, establishing a currency, setting up the institutions of a new state, and making decisions about everything from a national anthem to new energy providers and a head of state using citizens’ assemblies and perhaps specic referenda, as never before in the UK. Overturning such a process looks dficult and very unlikely.Nonetheless, the SNP leader’s remarks have infuriated many unionists who raise the prospect of a never-ending cycle of contradictory referendums and accuse Nicola Sturgeon of luring swithering voters with the idea that a Yes vote is easily reversed – like a longer, constitutional version of the -day cooling off period. Some suggest thatshe won Indyref, Nicola Sturgeon would immediately change the rules so a two-thirds majority would be needed to reverse it. Others insist this unexpected turn in the independence debate was crafted simply to distract from rows over hospitals and the Named Person scheme. Perhaps though, this furious response from opponents of independence is a back-handed compliment – angry recognition that the First Minister’s refusal to bind the hands of future voters probably appeals to a Scottish electorate fairly keen on democratic practice and legal process and fairly scunnered with the cheerful disregard for popular sovereignty shown by most unionist parties. Ms Sturgeon’s emphasis on democratic process is consistent, whether it’s a People’s Vote on Brexit or the need for a specic referendum majority – not just an election mandate – to begin negotiations for independence with London. Above all, the First Minister’s willingness to countenance another referendum that might reverse the crowning achievement of her le’s work, puts clear blue water between herself and Jo Swinson who will simply revoke Article  without a referendum, in the unlikely event that she wins power in the next general election. Since the SNP and Lib Dems may soon be fighting it out for Scottish Remain votes, Nicola Sturgeon’s “old fashioned” commitment to democracy at all costs and at any political price, may yet pay idends.And the First Minister’s talk of indyref has another simple merit for independence supporters. By focusing public attention on what might happen after the next referendum, she’s made a legally binding indyref and a Yes victory sound imminent and inevitable. There are also downsides. Opening up the possibility of another referendum after independence invites confusion with the quite separate argument for a confirmatory vote on the deal extracted from London. As far as I understand it, the First Minister is definitely not arguing for that. Nor is she inviting debate on other proposals that would constrain indyref by imposing a two-thirds majority, a turnout threshold or the like. The SNP backs the Venice Commission, a group of constitutional experts which advises the Council of Europe. It opposes the use of anything but a simple majority for important constitutional votes and asks how democracy would be serveda  per cent vote was declared null and void, because it had failed to reach a higher threshold. In such a situation, would the status quo really feel like a “settled will”  The Brexit referendum has of course demonstrated the dficulty of victory by a very narrow margin. But the  Scottish home rule referendum also demonstrated the dficulty of victory by imposed and arbitrary thresholds. What’s needed to carry the day is the active involvement of folk from every part of society – especially those on the vanquished side, something the Scottish Government has accepted far more easily than either recent UK Prime Minister. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie says SNP supporters will go bananas when they hear the First Minister is lining up Indyref as well as Indyref. I doubt it. There’s been little response so far, even from established critics of the SNP leader.Partly that’s down to discipline. But mostly that’s because independence obviously allows Scots to consider a new form of loose union with the rUK, membership of the Nordic Council, or maybe the halfway house of EFTA in preference to the EU.Such freedom may look scary after centuries of constraint. But it’s a fear mature independent countries hug with relish. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable.

The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

Gareth’s identity was revealed in a News Letter article and the story was picked up by This Morning who invited him and his we Kirsty to appear on the show this morning.Lea also appeared on the show along with her sister Shannon and niece Akeelah, who slept soundly throughout the interview. Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing. Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -. When you consider that Ireland’s Jacob Stockdale is as low as  , Kolbe looks outstanding value while George North could also be worth an each-way punt at  . The Kolbe South Africa double is also available at  , while those looking a patriotic punt could do worse than back Iain Hendersonto score the first try for Ireland in Sunday’s opening game against Scotland with the Ulster ace available at  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"thomas has been behind the lens for","story":"TO many people in North Belfast Thomas McMullan is a familiar face in the local community.A multiple award-winning photographer, Thomas has been the man behind the camera for  years ever since the North Belfast News started publication in .Hailing from Chatham Street in old Ardoyne, Thomas was born in  in the Mater Hospital on the Crumlin Road and came from a family of three brothers. He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award. He has been recognised multiple times over the years in the awards.“It is great to be recognised for the daily work that I do.

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38519427.ece/e923f/BINARY/courts%20gavel.jpg","title":"jon tonge another divisive week in brexitland and theres no sign of fog clearing","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It ought to be a resignation issue but wont, given the proximity of a general election in late Autumn or early .Amid the noise, bluster and faux outrage, there will be a sizeable number of Labour MPs privately anxious to avoid a resumption of Parliament. Why would they want to be dragged from the fun of a party conference by the Brighton seaside to hear parliamentary arguments played on a repeat loop for the last year  While it is unlikely that the Supreme Court, should it find against the Government, will determine the date Parliament should resume, the pressure for an immediate restoration would be huge. That could take a wrecking ball to the Conservatives gathering in Manchester at the end of this month.In truth, Parliament prorogued is probably as effective as Parliament sitting. MPs wasted the last year voting against all options. The Liberal Democrats have now decided that all options are off now, anyway. They will simply cancel Brexit. This from a party that supported a referendum.Any chance of a deal will owe precious little to Westminster, where posturing and pantomime had long displaced any serious consideration of the issues at stage. Instead, progress will be a product of often fractious but, of late, somewhat more measured exchanges involving the UK and Irish governments, the EU and the DUP.Arlene Fosters party made a signicant concession in accepting all-Ireland - in effect, EU - alignment in agriculture and food, butthat is the limit to the DUPs movement, there is still huge distance to travel. More than % of cross-border trade is in other sectors and the demand for the backstop remains for those aspects.There is a reasonable chance that the backstop is re-labelled as it is politically toxic - but a renaming is not a dispelling. Resolving the issues will require much more moderation and considerable fudging.Assurances might be given to the DUP that any checking of goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to, at most, token checks. A revival of Stormont could be talked up as part of a triple-lock on any EU expansion of regulations covering all-Ireland trade, involving the Westminster and Dublin parliaments and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some concessions to the technocratic approach to customs and regulations checks offered by the Alternative Arrangements Commission might be forthcoming. The sum of modest parts might be sufficient to claim victory in modying the Withdrawal Agreementor upholding all its principles .The DUP needs a win to take to its own party conference at the end of October, which, like Sinn Feins Ard Fheis three weeks later, might take on the appearance of a pre-election rally. Given the DUPs long-standing opposition to the backstop, the party needs to show how it made a substantial contribution to its modication. Bilateral discussions between Arlene Foster and the Taoiseach indicate that neither party wants to be responsible for a no-deal failure. Leo Varadkar has got most of his electorate onside in the blame game. It might be harder for Arlene Foster at an election, even allowing that the DUPs support has held up perfectly well in the three years since the EU referendum.The endgame will probably not become clear until the European Council meeting in mid-October. It may be autumn but it is neither mellow nor fruitful. Just very misty, with little sign of the fog clearing.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

The door is now wide open for an independent higher education institution for the North West.It provides us with a once-in-a-letime opportunity for the city-region, as long as we are prepared to grasp it. It is now almost  years since the campaign for a Derry university first began.Specically, the report raises a number of questions, which must be answeredwe are to redress what parliamentarians are now referring to as ‘the last-remaining civil rights issue’.These include:What legislation will be necessary to ensure that the new Derry-centred university will transcend both sides of the border, as regards teaching provision, RD, student intake and administration What legislation will be required from Dublin, London and Europe, to ensure revenue funding for a standalone cross-border university in the North West If a HE provider from Southern Ireland, where student fees are lower, were to become a partner in the new NW university, would fees here also be lower Is there any impediment to the National University of Ireland applying for a Charter to establish a university whose main campus is Derry  The report suggests that the institution seeking degree-awarding powers should be ‘physically operating’ in Northern Ireland. Can Derry Strabane Council be the anchor ‘operating’ partner, with NUI as the provider Can an accredited further education provider, such as the North West Regional College, apply for degree-awarding powers  What processes must it complete Derry Strabane Council is applying directly to the United Kingdom Governmentfor funding for a medical school for the North West. What action is council taking as regards applying to ‘UKG’, and other governments, for funding for an independent university for the North West Can Derry Strabane Council now operate its proposed Medical School with a new HE providerat Magee Will central government now increase the MaSN Cap, which restricts the number of HE students in the North, to accommodate the development of a new university in the North West Can central government ensure that the new independent NW university stays viable by ensuring that the minimum cap for the new institution remains permanently at ,  In February , the Department for the Economy, wrote to UU asking for ‘its rationale for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus’.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening.

I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university responds questions regarding city deal funds medical school","story":"The Derry News posed a number of questions to Ulster Universityover the continued uncertainty on the establishment of a Medical School at Magee College.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFirstly, we asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"montgomery couple aiming high

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since .

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote.

We appreciate that while this may only be the start of the process, we would call on the landowners to talk to us and the local council.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOur door is open and we are happy to chat. We very much view ourselves as good neighbours. We hope that moving forward agreement can be reached.Since , work has progressed and a number of studies completed in an effort to advance the planned railway extension, including the completion of a revised business case, along a disused section of line.Council officials argue that the planned extension would help the local authority meet of one its key objectives in transforming the district into one of Irelandrsquos premier tourist destinations and help attract and promote economic investment, enhancing the visitor experience.In addition, council officials are confident that extending the heritage railway line would assist with the regeneration of a rural area.The local authority said attempts to negotiate a settlement with three landowners at the Ballydugan end of the railway line had not been successful.As a result, the local authorityrsquos lawyers are to be asked to proceed with a vesting application to allow heritage railway officials to progress discussions with prospective project funders.Downpatrick councillors Cadogan Enright and Dermot Curran have welcomed the proposal to vest the land.Cllr Enright mdash who formally proposed that the vesting process should commence mdash said the former Down Council earmarked finance to acquire the land to pave the way for the railwayrsquos extension.He said given the inability to persuade current owners of unused track bed toit to public ownership ldquovesting has become necessary.Cllr Enright added: ldquoWe have been trying to get this done voluntarily for the past  years and more and I am delighted that the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee is backing the proposal to proceed with vesting.Cllr Curran said the local railway had been a ldquomajor success since it opened and had managed to secured hundreds of thousands of pounds in funding from a iety of sources to provide an attraction which is second to none.ldquoThe railway is one of the most popular attractions of its kind in Northern Ireland and has had ambitious expansion plans on the table for some time, he continued.ldquoThe local authority has put tourism at the top of its agenda and extending the railway, I believe, would be a major boost for the area. An extended railway would also be able to ferry punters to and from Downpatrick racecourse on race days.Cllr Curran said he hopes that the vesting process can be completed smoothly and relatively quickly with agreement between all the parties to allow the railwayrsquos extension plan to proceed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Safety.jpg","title":"Safety upgrade work begins at roundabout  ","story":"WORK has started on a major safety upgrade at one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.Contractors moved on site at the Dundrum Rod roundabout in Newcastle on Monday to provide new puffin crossing points which will require traffic to come to a complete stop to allow people to cross the road.The new crossings are being provided at the Dundrum and Castlewellan road sides of the roundabout and will replace existing zebra crossings. The work is scheduled to last five weeks.Major concerns voiced by residents and local politicians about pedestrian safety at this part of the resort mdash where there have been countless near misses particularly at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout mdash prompted roads officials to act. Some pedestrians have also been struck by vehicles.The provision of new puffin crossings will result in traffic lights being provided either side of the roundabout, with the move welcomed by Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke.He described the provision of the new crossings as a ldquolong overdue priority for pedestrian safety in Newcastle explaining that they will help reduce pedestrian collisions and near misses at a particularly busy part of the resort.ldquoAlong with other elected representatives, community and residentsrsquo groups, the local Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the public I have campaigned for the replacement of the zebra crossing with a controlled lights crossing, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI have campaigned for this road safety measure for over a decade and am delighted work has started this week. I would also urge motorists to be patient and allow more time for their journeys over the next five weeks as the work progresses.Describing the new road safety measure as a lsquolong overdue priority, Cllr Clarke said the new crossings will be warmly welcomed.He said that also as part of the scheme, a new footpath will be created at the Castlewellan Road side of the roundabout linking the new puffin crossing at the Dundrum Road side.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThe ongoing work will provide safe, controlled crossing facilities and will assist with reducing personal injury collisions recorded at the roundabout.News of work starting on the new crossings comes weeks after roads officials scrapped another proposal to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout.The Department of Infrastructure was planning to create a new dedicated filter lane at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout, designed to enable drivers entering the resort from this direction, wishing to access the Castlewellan Road, to do so without causing major tailbacks.The scheme mdash which had not been fully costed mdash would have left two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the centre of Newcastle.Roads engineers were confident that the proposal would have signicantly reduced congestion, but it was recently confirmed at a special meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council that the plug had been pulled on the scheme.Local politicians were told that the project was not viable given the number of underground utilities at this part of the resort. However, roads officials confirmed that they are in the process of drawing up an alternative scheme, the detail of which they hope to unveil shortly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Smyth.jpg","title":"Smyth first home at Finnebrogue Woods  ","story":"OVER  athletes took part in inaugural M B McGrady  Co Chartered Accountants Beer and Bubbles charity run at Finnebrogue Woods last Thursday night.Sunny weather made for perfect running conditions for the race that took place in Finnebrogue Woods, on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Prizes were awarded to fastest male, David Smyth and fastest female, Carissa McLister, who completed her first ever km race.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukFuneral details for Francis McCarville

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/dm11.jpg","title":"tech entrepreneur named catalysts innovation founder","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business A top tech entrepreneur has been named as Catalyst’s Innovation Founder for  by a  of leading judges.
