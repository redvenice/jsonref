SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the pandemic, constantly mutates and can pick up genetic quirks as it replicates.  In most cases the mutations are harmless, but occasionally they can make the virus more transmissible or better able to evade vaccines as is the case with the Omicron variant. Omicron has 32 mutations on its spike proteins alone, nearly five times more than Delta.Claims of the emergence of a new Deltacron variant came a lab in Cyprus which has reportedly submitted its findings to GISAID, an international database that tracks different Covid variants and their spread. Cyprus currently has one of the highest Covid cases per head of population rates in the world.  Stats compiled by Oxford University-backed research team Our World in Data shows that as of yesterday Cyprus recorded 5050 daily Covid cases per million people.This is nearly double the amount of the UK which recorded 2,607 daily cases per million people on the same date. "},{"url":null,"title":"spend less and better 10 ways to save money in january","story":"Use more lists and get into the habit of only buying what you need.

Photograph: iStockThe  2021 Feeder School list, published today, provides new insights into the education pathways taken by thousands of students who have completed the Leaving Cert cycle. The following are five of the key take-aways from this year’s data:1. Class a determinant At a macro level more students from Deis schools (3,524) secured places on high points courses in 2021 than from fee-paying schools (3,392).The undoubted success of investment in Deis schools these figures reveal is tempered by the fact that the numbers are a proportion of Deis 10,540 school leavers, whereas the fee-paying numbers are drawn from a much smaller cohort of just 3,912 school leavers.At a micro level it would appear that fee-paying schools still dominate our most sought-after courses. Ten of the top 15 boys’ schools in terms of progression to third level are fee-paying colleges. The five non-fee-paying schools in this category, Ard Scoil Rís, Limerick Oatlands College, Mount Merrion St Benildus Stillorgan, Capuchin Rochestown Cork and Christian Brothers, Mitchelstown, mostly draw their pupils from families with similar social class backgrounds to their neighbouring fee-paying schools.Interestingly, only seven of the top 15 girls-only second-level schools are fee-paying, with three of the four most successful colleges being non-fee paying. 1st Salerno in Galway, 2nd Loreto Dalkey (fee-paying), 3rd Coláiste Muire Ennis, 4th Coláiste Íde, An Daingean.Again social-class background rather than attending a fee-paying college seems to be the determinant factor governing levels of progression.2. Most students are choosing to apply to their local or regional colleges  Irish young people, unlike their compatriots in the UK, tend to apply for third level places at their local colleges. Research carried out with those who have progressed to third level indicate that most Irish school leavers apply to attend colleges where they can continue to socialise with their peer group.There is also a growing economic factor causing students to select their local institutions, driven in large part by the soaring cost of accommodations in our towns and cities: living away from home adds hugely to the cost of attending college.There are significantly lower third level progression rates among students in counties or geographic locations, which do not have access to third level institutions and who are therefore unable to attend a chosen course without living away from home. Contrast Kilkenny 68 per cent, Longford (68) and Laois (70) with Galway (81), Donegal (84), and Clare 86 percentage progression rates to third level.3. Progression by post code Apart from the school a child attends, where families live also seems to determine overall third level progression rates. The most affluent parts of the capital city, such as Dublin 6 and Dublin 14, saw 104 and 96 per cent respectively of the total numbers of 2021 6th years who sat the Leaving Cert in schools within these postal districts progress to third level this year.In other postal districts of the city Dublin 11 and 7, the proportion of Leaving Cert students progressing to college in 2021 were 54 and 64 per cent respectively. The ide is also stark when the figures are broken down into those who secured places on higher points courses. Some 96 per cent of school leavers in Dublin 6 went on to one of these programmes, compared with 46 per cent in Dublin 11.4.We still want to pursue the CAO route The current year’s numbers reveal Ireland’s exceptionally high third level participation rate, which is among the highest in the world.Ireland also continues to have one of the highest retent- ion rates in second level across Europe: that is the proportion of students who stay in school until the Leaving Cert.5. The growth of full-time senior cycle grinds schools While pupil numbers sitting the Leaving Cert continue to increase annually due to demographic factors, our figures show that numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in 143 second-level schools (composed of nine fee-paying, 44 Deis and 90 non-fee paying institutions) dropped by more than 15 per cent this year, compared to their 2020 numbers.So what may be driving these numbers? Firstly, the country was still in recession when this year’s cohort of Leaving Cert students started second level in 2015. Specifically, in relation to the lower numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in fee-paying schools in 2021, the downturn hit family incomes in 2015, adversely affecting enrolment numbers in these schools at that time.Secondly, and probably more importantly, the presence of full-time grind schools in our major cities offering a two-year Leaving Cert programme seems to be drawing some families who can afford the fees for the final twothree years of second level education.Some parents believe that the grind schools offer a more flexible range of subject choices than those available in their child’s second-level schools. Furthermore, many students want to escape what they perceive to be restrictive rules and regulations central to our second-level school cultures."},{"url":null,"title":"no justification for hybrid leving cert exams this year say teachers unions","story":"The traditional leaving cert exams must take place this year and there is ‘no justification’ for offering additional options to students, teachers’ unions have said.The traditional leaving cert exams must take place this year and there is “no justification” for offering additional options to students, teachers’ unions have said.Opposition politicians have in recent weeks renewed calls for a hybrid model of examinations this year – a choice between exams and accredited grades – to account for the disruption caused by Covid-19.However, in a statement on Monday, the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) said it would not support any options other than the traditional exams.The recent contributions from politicians around the issue are “unhelpful and will inevitably lead to more uncertainty in school communities”, the union said.“We are already receiving reports of students disengaging because of an expectation that they will not have to sit examinations. This is very damaging to the education system and to the prospects of those students.”The TUI said schools have remained open throughout this academic year, despite the challenges of high levels of community infection with Covid-19 and isolation rules.“The scheduling of orals and music practicals in the traditional Easter break has created additional tuition time that would not previously have been available, balancing somewhat the losses in time that students have experienced,” it added.ProcessThe standardisation process used for predicted grades over the past two years requires junior cycle data, however due to the pandemic, some of the current leaving cert students did not sit those exams.“Advocates for a repeat of the emergency methods are therefore advocating for something that is either impossible or else will be radically changed and involve historical school data that would be hugely unfair for many students,” the TUI added.The union said it will continue to engage with stakeholders, adding that further consideration could be given to extending the breadth of topics covered in papers or adjusting marking schemes to account for this year’s circumstances.The Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (ASTI) said it is committed to an “externally-assessed Leaving Certificate”, in line with students’ and teachers’ expectations.“The preservation of Ireland’s high quality, fair, and independent State Exams system is vital,” he union said.“Leaving Cert students are currently preparing for a variety of non-written examinations such as practicals and orals to take place in Spring, alongside their preparation for the written examinations in June.”It added: “Speculation regarding previous one-off grading processes during the pandemic is unhelpful at this stage, particularly given that the data used for these processes is not available for all 2022 Leaving Cert students.”Paul Crone, director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD), said there needs to be something additional to this year’s exams to account for the Covid disruption.“We don’t know exactly what that should look like, or what’s possible, but what we’re saying is we should put students first,” he said.“A lot of them didn’t sit a junior cert, lost time last year and are losing time now due to isolation. Anything would be helpful, and we’re willing to sit down and engage with all of the stakeholders to see what’s possible.”ChoiceSecondary students also want additional choice in this year’s Leaving Cert exams to compensate for Covid-related disruption to school, according to the Irish Secondary Students’ Union (ISSU).Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire, Sinn Féin’s education spokesman, is among those who has called for a hybrid approach. He believes students do want to sit exams, but believes giving them the hybrid option is the fairest way to do it due to the time they have missed as a result of the pandemic.He acknowledged that a proportion of these students have not sat a junior cert, which would have an impact on the standardisation process, but said there should be “discussions” around the modality of the system, adding it is not an “insurmountable challenge”.It remains Government policy to return to traditional written junior cycle and Leaving Cert exams this year, with additional choice of questions to take account of the disruption to learning.It is intended that two sets of Leaving Cert exams will be run in the summer for students affected by Covid and other illnesses."},{"url":null,"title":"schools to be allowed bank special education hours being lost to covid","story":"The change of policy, which was announced by the Department on Monday, is in place until the mid-term break in late February. Photograph: EPAThe Department of Education is allowing schools to “bank” hours lost by erting special education teachers into mainstream classes. The change of policy, which was announced by the Department on Monday, is in place until the mid-term break in late February. The Department has said given the current level of employee absences due to Covid-19, schools have on occasion had to use their non-mainstream, non-classroom teachers to maintain in-person education this week. “The Department is also conscious that there are numbers of children absent from school at present, either isolating as a result of Covid-19 or as a close contact,” it said. “Schools are reminded to abide by the terms of the recent information note on sequencing of substitution so that use of SET is minimised but, where it cannot be avoided, schools will be permitted to bank the hours to ensure that children with additional needs continue to be supported.”The Department said non-classroom teachers, such as special education teachers and English language teaching supports should only be used as a measure of “last resort where it was not possible to secure a substitute teacher”. “This measure was to minimise in particular the disruption to learning for children with additional needs in mainstream classes who accessed additional teaching in their schools,” it said. “It does not impact on children with additional needs in special classes (such as classes for children with autism) as it relates to non-classroom special education teachers.”Schools have been asked to “make every effort to obtain a substitute” for all teacher absences, including the use of student teachers and administrative principals or deputy principals if applicable. The Department said given the current high Covid-19 case numbers, schools will continue to require additional substitute cover in the period leading up to the mid-term break, to February 23rd to assist in dealing with staff absences.

However, she was advised by the HSE to go to a mass vaccination centre in Enniscorthy to receive her booster. “Hannah has behaviour problems. There will be queues to get vaccinated... it will take a long time for Hannah to feel comfortable.”Ms Hennessy rang her doctor, who agreed to vaccinate her daughter. “The doctor is going to have to vaccinate her in the car park in the car... if I was to bring her into the doctors ... she would get very distressed.” Sharon McManus from Salthill in Galway has a son (10) with autism. Myles was tested for Covid in a large centre. “We met one staff at registration and I told her that Myles had autism and was worried about the test. She didn’t reply to this at all.” EncouragingHowever, Ms McManus says the tester was encouraging and talked Myles through the process. Myles became distressed at one point during the test and shouted out. “The tester appeared apprehensive during the process but did a great job.”Ms McManus would like to get a vaccine for her son, but she would prefer to bring him to a GP clinic or pharmacy where she could explain his needs in advance.She also thinks there should be a way to include additional information before testing and vaccination. “It is not appropriate to have to impart sensitive, personal information as you queue in an open area. There is no privacy, and these conversations can increase anxiety for the child.”Jane Johnstone from Wexford has two sons with additional needs. Her son Evan is 21. He has autism and an intellectual disability. He was initially vaccinated through his day service. Daniel, her other son, is 17 and also has autism. He got his initial dose of the vaccine in a mass vaccination centre.While she says the vaccination staff couldn’t have been nicer, Daniel became overwhelmed by the strange environment and engaged in self-harming behaviours. “He became very distressed in the cubicle. People were looking in. I know it is only human nature, but where is his dignity and privacy?”The nurse who was vaccinating Daniel reassured him and he got the vaccine, but the 15-minute wait after the jab was also very tough, she says .“Once we got back into the car, I put on my sunglasses and a few tears rolled down my face. Why couldn’t we do it in an environment that was more familiar? Such as in respite or school, or a clinic specifically for people with a disability?”Both Daniel and Evan got their boosters in the car park of their GP which was best for their safety but lacked privacy, she saysBespokeIn a statement, the HSE said the appointments offered to vulnerable adults were predominantly through vaccination centres, but there were some bespoke, onsite and GP clinics.There is also a standard operational procedure for the vaccination of children with additional needs, and the HSE said parents can request these accommodations by contacting HSE Live, who can alert the vaccination centre in advance of their child’s appointment.The HSE added that there are also some specialist clinics available, such as t Citywest in Dublin and a centre in Limerick. “In addition to this, any children (or adults) who are unable to leave their homes to receive a vaccination will receive their booster vaccine in their own homes.

Photograph: Andrew DownesPA Wire What did we learn from Day One of the Great Golfgate Trial?We found out that lawyers – if the legal heavyweights who turned up in force for a district court case in Galway are anything to go by – have a rather sniffy attitude to golf. Not quite their cup of tee.And that the Oireachtas Golf Society was a hitherto unrecognised major force in Irish political history until it hit the headlines last year due to the “Golfgate” furore.We learned that the size of a gap in a partition is a moveable feast. It certainly was moveable at the particular feast under the spotlight in Judge Mary Fahy’s courtroom on Thursday.We discovered that the annual President’s Prize dinner was not a “frivolous” event in 2020 and that the traditional presentation at the 19th hole after a convivial day on the links was anything but “a frolic”.That this event was, in fact, “poignant”. This is because it was held in honour of a politician who was behind the much-underestimated Golfing Revival Era in Irish politics 50 years ago. The late Mark Killilea was a driving force in the resurrection of the Oireachtas Golf Society, which had fizzled out after it was founded by a TD called Major Somethingorother in 1929.We heard that the then captain of the guard in Leinster House, an enthusiastic member of the society, had two breakfasts and one evening meal in the hotel which is now at the centre of this court case. And that a member of the Seanad and his wife left the dinner before the formalities commenced because “we’re not dessert people”.And that guidelines issued with the “imprimatur of the State” and bearing the harp of Rialtas na hÉireann on printed communications may, or may not be, worthless.We also learned on the opening day of the trial of politicians Noel Grealish and Donie Cassidy and hotel bosses John and James Sweeney for allegedly contravening the Covid emergency health act by holding a dinner indoors for over 50 people, that all of the witnesses called by the prosecution had nothing but praise for how the defendants managed the event.Bending the rulesThe story of the Oireachtas Golf Society’s now-infamous dinner hit the headlines late in 2020. In the early days of the pandemic, claims that politicians had been bending the strict rules painfully and dutifully observed by wider society caused uproar. But the lawyers acting for Grealish and Cassidy set out from the start to show how their clients acted with the utmost propriety at all times and their actions have been gravely misunderstood by the public.Which brings us back to something else learned on Thursday: when push comes to shove, it’s all the media’s fault. In this case, according to Donie Cassidy’s lawyer Colm Smyth SC, for getting involved and then “public hysteria was whipped up and hysteria was whipped up”.This, he said, led to “a lot of very good people” having “to resign from their positions”.Near the end of the first day, Martin Brett, a Fine Gael councillor from Kilkenny who was at the golf outing and dinner in Connemara, said he didn’t even know how many people were at the function until he read it in the paper.“Don’t believe what you read in the newspapers and the journal,” said Eoghan Cole BL, for the State.Barrister Cole was up against it. A lone ranger on the DPP’s side against the heavy guns hired by the defendants. The place was coming down with junior and senior counsel and instructing solicitors.Smyth, for Donie Cassidy, made the most running on day one, with bracing interventions from Senator Michael McDowell SC (for former PD colleague and now independent TD Noel Grealish) and the country’s leading libation lawyers Constance Cassidy and Eddie Walsh (for James and John Sweeney, respectively).Bewildering meanderThere isn’t much you can tell those two about the licensing laws. When Constance, in the midst of a bewildering meander through statutory instruments and hospitality regulations, talked about “the consumption of intoxicating liquor”, you knew it wasn’t the first time she said those words.Among the ranks of the BLs was junior counsel Willie Penrose, the former Labour TD. He is part of the Cassidy squad.As for the journalists sent to cover this trial of the half-century (50 years a-fourballing, and all that), there was no room in the court building for them. Two were allowed inside to hear the proceedings, the rest given a video link to download and hope for the best.Enter the hero of the hour: Fergal McGrath, brother of former TD Finian, who runs the Town Hall Theatre opposite the courthouse. Fergal made a room available to the hacks (which is more than the Courts Service could manage, despite this being a case of national interest which was flagged months ago).Business for Fergal has been hugely impacted by Covid, but he has a tasty line-up of events coming in the new year. The panto, sadly, had to be cancelled so all the kiddies in Galway missed out on the fairy godmother saying: “You shall go to the (golf) ball!”After a morning spent mostly in legal discussion, Colm Smyth got round to telling us of Donie Cassidy. A man who has never been before the courts in his life, has had a distinguished political career and is the owner of four hotels in Dublin, and that’s just for starters. “A lawmaker, not a lawbreaker.”Donie, in Colm’s words, sounded like Santa. Before the event, “he checked the regulations. He checked the guidelines. He consulted with people.” Probably to make sure nobody would be naughty and everyone would be nice.Former TD and senator Cassidy was president of the society. His co-defendant, TD Noel Grealish, was captain on the night.No hand, act or putterMichael McDowell said this was very important because his client’s position is that president Cassidy organised the do as it was his dinner. Noel Grealish, as captain, had some involvement in organising the first day of golf but “I just want to be 100 per cent clear” he had no hand, act or putter in organising the shindig on the second night.Eddie and Constance, meanwhile, said that the “company” as opposed to the two Mr Sweeneys should have been charged.Then Colm Smyth started talking about “potentially an unsavoury aspect” to the prosecution, without explaining entirely what he meant.“Substantiate the unsavouryness,” challenged Eoghan Cole, for the State.The witnesses so far are all people who attended the golf dinner.They were blown away by the Covid prevention measures taken by management.The mainly retired minor politicians who attended this dinner were “exceptionally impressed”. But then, they don’t get out as much as they used to. There would be no “intermingling” at this hooley in Connemara.One of the guests recalled the rigid attention to the pandemic prevention rules on the night.“A waiter said to me: table service only. You don’t move unless you go to the toilet.”One of the lawyers pointed approvingly to “the liberality of sanitisers and so on”.There was some discussion as to whether they were separated by a “partition” or “a solid wall” but there was a definite ision until the gap appeared at prize-giving.It was seven to eight feet on either side of a pillar, according to one witness, and “probably the width of a person”, according to another.But did two separate rooms of people attending the dinner constitute a single event or multiple events? It’s a bit like St Patrick and the shamrock – three leaves on the one stem. St Donie and the dinner – two rooms on the one feed.Judge Fahy will have to decide.She admitted she isn’t much into golf, with the course in Ballyconneely more “the Dublin fours”. Michael McDowell and Eddie Cassidy were similarly unmoved by the joys of the game.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"public service unions welcome restoration of working hours recommendation","story":"Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath told The  last year that the Government would not commit to a full reversal of additional working hours, but would begin to examine the potential consequences of such a move.  Photograph: Gareth Chaney Collins Public service unions have welcomed a recommendation that working hours be restored to pre-Haddington Road Agreement levels from next July.The 2013 deal increased the working week to 37 hours for those who had been working 35 hours or less up to that point. Those working more than 35 hours faced an increase of up to 39 hours.Although pay cuts introduced in the austerity era were temporary, it had been the general position of governments that parallel work practice reforms would remain in place, including additional unpaid working hours.However, on Monday it emerged that the Independent Body Examining Additional Working Hours chaired by Kieran Mulvey has sent recommendations to restore working hours for civil and public servants to the Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath, as agreed under the Building Momentum Public Service Agreement.Ahead of the publication of recommendations, Fórsa, which represents thousands of public service workers, said that if the Government accepts Mr Mulvey’s recommendation it would unwind the final element of the HRA’s austerity measures.Noting that temporary pay cuts for more senior public servants had already been restored, general secretary Kevin Callinan said such a move on working hours would remove “a longstanding and debilitating drain on morale and productivity”.“The acceptance of the recommendation by Government would also significantly enhance the prospect for continued stability in public service delivery and quality, not least by removing a huge obstacle to the successful negotiation of a public service agreement to replace Building Momentum when it expires later this year,” he said.Disproportionate impactThe union has questioned the assumption that increased working time would lead to additional productivity. Mr Callinan pointed out that civil service departments had temporarily reduced the working day to seven hours from 7.24 during the pandemic, “largely to facilitate social distancing, and productivity was at an all-time high during that period”.The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) also welcomed the move saying it would help with the retention of nurses and midwives.“The additional hours have disproportionately impacted our largely female workforce,” said general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha, who said the measure had pushed many nurses and midwives into part-time work.“Since 2013 the addition unpaid hours have had a considerable negative impact on morale, and the retention of nurses and midwives within the public health service.”INMO members voted to accept the Building Momentum Agreement and its full implementation ahead of new public service agreement negotiations later this year.“The INMO, along with other unions that represent public and civil servants, is confident that the return to pre-Haddington Road hours can be achieved without an excessive additional cost to the exchequer or damage the output of our public sector.”Early last year, Minister McGrath told The  that the Government would not commit to a full reversal of additional working hours, but would begin to examine the potential consequences of such a move.In 2017 the Department estimated it would cost over €600 million, although that figure has been disputed by trade unions.On Monday, a spokeswoman confirmed that the Minister had received correspondence from Mr Mulvey containing conclusions and recommendations.“The Minister looks forward to receiving the full report from the body in the coming weeks,” she said. “The Government, continuing to prioritise service delivery, will respond to all of the body’s recommendations at that point.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"uganda reopens schools for first time since march 2020","story":"Children return to the classroom  at Kitante primary school in Kampala, Uganda, on Monday.  Photograph:  Esther Ruth MbabaziThe New York TimesUganda has reopened schools for the first time since March 2020 after the world’s longest Covid-19 related school shutdown, affecting 15 million children. Up to one-third of students may not return, authorities say.“We can’t let this happen again. We must keep schools open for every child, everywhere,” the UN children’s fund Unicef\u0026nbspsaid in a tweet on Monday.“The Embassy of Ireland wishes the best of luck to all students returning to school in Uganda today!” tweeted Uganda’s Irish embassy. “As chair of the Education development partners’ group, Ireland remains committed to supporting the sector, providing an additional €1.8 million to support safe reopening of schools.”During the period that schools in Uganda were shut, aid organisations reported a rise in the levels of child labour.Children interviewed by The  began making bricks, breaking stones into granite or selling masks or snacks on the streets to support their families. One 10-year-old, Moses, sold eggs for 500 Ugandan shillings (€0.12) each, while 13-year-old Omara Mark Desmond sold face masks for 1,000 Ugandan shillings – work that he said left him too tired to study at home in the evenings.The number of teenage pregnancies also rose, raising questions about whether young mothers will be helped to return to education.While Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni\u0026nbspinitially promised to provide free radios to each home so children could learn remotely, this was not followed through. The shutdown further increased the gaps between children from poor and wealthy families, who have access to the internet or even private tutors.Some classes opened temporarily in late 2020 but then closed again. The government has said children will restart school in a class above where they were 22 months ago.The leadership of the East African nation of roughly 46 million people has been criticised for using Covid-19 as an excuse to repress its citizens for political reasons. Public transport was banned for months, political opponents were arrested and accused of spreading disease, and a curfew of either 7pm or 9pm has been in place for most of the pandemic.Uganda is one of the poorest countries in the world, but its leadership also banned food distributions not organised through the government, saying anyone who carried them out would be charged with attempted murder. Critics said this was another attempt to stop the opposition from currying favour ahead of the highly disputed January 2021 elections, in which Mr Museveni – who has been in power since 1986 – won another term.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"African country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"must listen south african scientists omicron","story":"‘There are several things we don’t know about omicron,” a sombre Professor Sir Chris Whitty told the nation in the week before Christmas, “but all the things we do know are bad.”His comment puzzled many people at the time, given that scientists in South Africa, where omicron was first identified, had reported that it appeared to be less severe than the then-dominant delta variant of Covid. Surely that was good news?Three weeks on, Sir Chris’s determination to dismiss the encouraging data coming from South Africa seems even more baffling. Instead of the post-Christmas lockdown that came to be regarded almost as an inevitability, Covid rules are now being eased. The NHS did not collapse, and the number of patients requiring ventilation remains less than a quarter of the peak a year ago.Legitimate questions are now being asked about why Britain was so dismissive of the evidence from South Africa, and whether Government scientific advisers are once again using fear as a method of control.One of those who is doing the asking is Angelique Coetzee, chairman of the South African Medical Association and the first doctor to raise the alarm over a possible new variant, which turned out to be omicron.Dr Coetzee was among those who reported that omicron caused “very, very mild” symptoms compared with delta, and she hypothesised that it “could potentially be of great help to us” by replacing the more dangerous delta variant and helping the population to reach herd immunity at minimal cost to life. She says she was “astonished” at the panicked response to it in the UK.“I don’t understand why it’s happening,” she told the  from her home in Pretoria. “It doesn’t make any sense to me. The fear that has been spread in Britain – why is that being done?“South Africa has a younger population, but we should have seen far more disease than you because of the vaccination picture. We only have 44 per cent of people double-jabbed, and we only started the boosters last week.”In the UK, 83 per cent of people are double-jabbed, and 61 per cent have had a booster.“If you don’t know by now that the majority of people are going to have mild symptoms, then what other evidence are you waiting for?”It is not the first time Government scientific advisers have allegedly been dismissive of what colleagues in foreign countries have been saying.On February 21, 2020, the Italian village of Vo’ Euganeo, near Venice, went into strict quarantine after the country’s first recorded death from Covid, and almost all of its residents were tested. Around 40 per cent of those who tested positive had no symptoms, strongly suggesting asymptomatic transmission was occurring.Some members of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) say they raised concerns about asymptomatic transmission with Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Adviser, and with modeller Prof Neil Ferguson, only for their concerns to be dismissed.The two men say the warnings were not ignored, yet Boris Johnson has always insisted he would have done things differently if he had understood sooner that Covid was transmitted asymptomatically (Britain resisted lockdowns for a further month after the Italian data was published).South Africa has a highly sophisticated genomic surveillance capability for Covid – which is why both the omicron and beta variants were first identified there – so the thoughts of its scientific experts surely merit attention.Yet Boris Johnson said last month that “the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus, I think that’s something we need to set on one side”, while Sir Chris said evidence from South Africa of a milder illness had been “overinterpreted”.Does Dr Coetzee think xenophobia has played a role in Britain’s dismissal of her advice? “No – but I think there was arrogance from the politicians in the UK. Also, Boris Johnson was going through a bad time because of the criticism of his Christmas parties, so maybe there was a political reason for all this.“People in the UK, including the ones advising the Government, don’t seem to understand what the clinical picture is. The scientists are not sitting with patients in front of them. I am a GP and I’m looking at a list of 116 patients I saw, of whom only three were admitted to hospital, one of whom was not fully vaccinated and two of whom were high risk because of obesity, diabetes and so on.“You have to empower people by telling them what is going on, but I get the feeling that some of the UK scientists didn’t want to use the word ‘mild’, they only want to use the word ‘severe’.”Her suspicion appears to be borne out by the language used by the SPI-M-O modelling committee, which on December 7 said: “Currently, there is no strong evidence that omicron infections are either more or less severe than delta infections.”Laura Dodsworth, author of the book A State of Fear: How the UK Government Weaponised Fear During the Covid-19 Pandemic, says the “linguistic manipulation” was entirely deliberate.“The omission of the word ‘mild’ is not an accident,” she says. “The problem for the Government is that once you have started using fear as a tactic, there is nowhere left to go, so you have to keep on using it, and you have to keep on quoting worst case scenarios.“But each time you do it, the tactics become less successful because people become wise to it. Once you have seen the smoke and mirrors, you can’t unsee it.”Modelling published by SPI-M-O on December 15 suggested a “high-level scenario” of infections, peaking at between 600,000 and 2 million per day with the current Plan B restrictions between late December and January, with up to 6,000 deaths per day, peaking between mid-January and mid-March.In fact, infections are currently averaging around 180,000 per day and may have already peaked in some parts of the country, with deaths averaging just over 150 per day.Mark Harper MP, chairman of the anti-lockdown Covid Recovery Group, said ministers had once again been guilty of blithely following expert advice rather than interrogating advisers and looking at the picture in the round.“The whole history of the pandemic shows that ministers need to ask better questions,” he says, “challenge the advice and really get their heads around what they are being told so they can weigh it up against all the other factors they need to consider in the best interests of the country.”The most gloomy predictions for the omicron wave now seem certain to have been wide of the mark. The problem for the Government is that if a more dangerous, vaccine-resistant variant arises, it could prove difficult to persuade an increasingly cynical public to do as they’re told.More from NewsRow erupts over Special Boat Service ‘using run-down pool’ to train for combatBusinessman ‘threw chocolate at passengers and attacked BA crew in drunken rampage’Scots could wear face masks for years under Nicola Sturgeon’s plan for living with CovidUltra low rates have created a new generation addicted to debtEx-Tory MP who raped wife told her \u0026#39everyone thinks I\u0026#39m fabulous\u0026#39 and no one will believe you, it is claimedScottish universities drop out of Stonewall equality league tables following ‘gender’ rowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccines pushed uk mortality rate lower start pandemic","story":"Deaths above the five-year average were considerably lower in 2021 than in the first year of the pandemic, demonstrating the huge impact of vaccines, figures suggest.Annual data from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) due to be released this week is expected to show that deaths in 2020 were 8.3 per cent above the 2015 to 2019 average, but dropped to just 2.7 per cent above the average last year – three times lower.The drop in mortality came despite huge numbers of infections at the beginning and end of 2021, suggesting that the vaccine rollout and prior immunity helped keep deaths lower than at the beginning of the pandemic.The figures also highlight a major difference in how the 2021 pandemic impacted age groups compared to 2020.Deaths in the over-65s were seven per cent lower than in 2020, and were close to the 10-year average, suggesting many older people who died in the 2021 winter wave would have died before the end of the year.However for under-65s, deaths were three per cent higher than in 2020, and 11 per cent higher than the 10-year average, suggesting younger people lost many years of life.Taken together, deaths in the two-year period of 2020-21 are expected to be about 5.5 per cent above the 2015-19 average, with experts saying that a deadlier two-year period had not been seen since the Second World War.“We tend to see falls in mortality over time and it is rare to see mortality in a year being higher than the preceding five-year average,” said Cobus Daneel, the chairman of the IFoA’s Continuous Mortality Investigation.“That happened in both 2020 and 2021, but only twice in the preceding 50 years. It is even more unusual to see a two-year period with mortality so far above the preceding five-year average. We have to go back eighty years to 1940-41 to find such an extreme period on this measure.”Although The Great Depression saw a rise in mortality of about 10 per cent in 1929, rates had dropped back by 1930, with the average of the two years only being two per cent above the prior five-year average.The figures are estimates and the final data will be crunched when the Office for National Statistics (ONS) releases final figures on Tuesday.Overall, deaths in 2021 were just one per cent higher than the 10-year average, but experts said that a drop in mortality would be expected over time, so even a small rise was worrying.Figures show that before 2020, no year has had higher mortality rates than the 10-year average since 1963.In 2021, more deaths were registered in England and Wales than in any year since the Eighties, apart from 2020.There are likely to be between 585,000 and 590,000 deaths registered in England and Wales in 2021. In contrast, 2020 was the first year since 1918 to see more than 600,000 deaths.More from NewsRow erupts over Special Boat Service ‘using run-down pool’ to train for combatBusinessman ‘threw chocolate at passengers and attacked BA crew in drunken rampage’Scots could wear face masks for years under Nicola Sturgeon’s plan for living with CovidUltra low rates have created a new generation addicted to debtEx-Tory MP who raped wife told her \u0026#39everyone thinks I\u0026#39m fabulous\u0026#39 and no one will believe you, it is claimedScottish universities drop out of Stonewall equality league tables following ‘gender’ rowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"enid blytons magic faraway tree get modern makeover jacqueline","story":"The Magic Faraway Tree, Enid Blyton’s beloved children’s adventure, is to get a modern makeover with a lesson about sexism.Jacqueline Wilson is writing a new version of the story, updated for the 21st century, in which three siblings named Milo, Mia and Birdy discover the enchanted wood.It will keep the original, magical inhabitants of the Faraway Tree, including Moon-Face, Silky the Fairy and the Saucepan Man.But when Moon-Face expresses a Blyton-esque sentiment about girls being required to help with domestic tasks, while boys do something more exciting, he is immediately educated on the subject of gender equality.Alexander Antscherl, editorial director at Enid Blyton Entertainment, said: “The book has got some nods to gender equality between girls and boys, which you didn’t always see in the original books.“Mia, the older girl, says that in the modern world girls are just as clever as boys, and sometimes cleverer.“In the story, there is a reference to Moonface asking Silky the fairy to help around the home. Mia tells him that he has sexist expectations of Silky, and explains why he should not say that.”That is not the only change. When Blyton wrote The Enchanted Wood (1939), The Magic Faraway Tree (1943) and The Folk of the Faraway Tree (1946), she allowed her young characters to roam free. As in the Famous Five and Secret Seven series, the children spent whole days, and even some nights, alone on their adventures.Today’s children - or, more accurately, their parents - might find the idea alarming. Mrs Wilson has acknowledged this in her book.“The parents are much more 21st century than in the original, and they do have anxiety about what their children get up to.“Jacqueline has very brilliantly got around that through the magic of time. For the children, time moves on, but back at home it stands still. The parents are drinking their morning coffee when the children go out to play, and still drinking it when the children get back.”The new book, to be published on May 26, is titled The Magic Faraway Tree: A New Adventure.Mrs Wilson has retained the idea of magical lands at the top of the tree, but included some of her own: the Land of Dragons and the Land of Unicorns.This is not the first update. In the 1990s, the original children’s names of Dick and Fanny were changed to Rick and Frannie.Mrs Wilson has form when it comes to updating literary classics. She previously wrote modern versions of Five Children and It and The Railway Children, the Edith Nesbit stories, and Susan Coolidge’s What Katy Did.Hachette, the publisher with the rights to the Blyton estate, commissioned an updating of Enid Blyton’s Secret Seven series in 2019. However, this is the first Magic Faraway Tree book in 75 years and the first by an author other than Enid Blyton.Mrs Wilson said she had loved the Faraway Tree books as a child. “It’s a privilege to be able to write about Enid Blyton’s iconic characters and invent new children and magical creatures of my own for new readers to enjoy,” she said.More from NewsRow erupts over Special Boat Service ‘using run-down pool’ to train for combatBusinessman ‘threw chocolate at passengers and attacked BA crew in drunken rampage’Scots could wear face masks for years under Nicola Sturgeon’s plan for living with CovidUltra low rates have created a new generation addicted to debtEx-Tory MP who raped wife told her \u0026#39everyone thinks I\u0026#39m fabulous\u0026#39 and no one will believe you, it is claimedScottish universities drop out of Stonewall equality league tables following ‘gender’ rowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"giant deep surfaces midlands one britains greatest ever prehistoric","story":"Scientists are celebrating one of the “greatest finds” in British palaeontological history after the skeleton of a 180 million-year-old sea dragon was discovered in Rutland.Measuring 10 metres in length with a skull weighing approximately one tonne, the ichthyosaur is the largest and most complete fossil of any marine reptile found in Britain.The discovery was made by Joe Davis, an employee of the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust, during a routine draining of a lagoon island at Rutland Water in February 2021.Ichthyosaurs were marine reptiles that lived in Britain 250 million years ago. They went extinct 90 million years ago.The animal was characterised by its large teeth and eyes, and ranged in size from one to more than 25 metres. It was first identified in the 19th century by the palaeontologist Mary Anning.Dr Dean Lomax, a palaeontologist who has studied the species, said: “Despite the many ichthyosaur fossils found in Britain, it is remarkable to think that the Rutland ichthyosaur is the largest skeleton ever found in the UK. It is a truly unprecedented discovery and one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history.“Not only is it the largest ichthyosaur skeleton ever found in Britain, but it is also the most complete skeleton of a large prehistoric reptile ever discovered in the UK. And yes, that includes dinosaurs.”When they first spotted the remains poking out of some clay, team members at Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust were unsure about their origins and suggested that they could simply be pipes. After speaking to Rutland council, experts from the University of Leicester were called and the ichthyosaur skeleton was identified.The remains were dug out by a team of expert palaeontologists from around the UK in August and September. They worked in partnership with Anglian Water, Rutland County Council and the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust. The skeleton was also surrounded by the remains of ammonites and belemnites, which may have been feasting on the animal\u0027s remains. Scientists said that the discovery could give them a better understanding of their ecosystems.Although two incomplete and much smaller ichthyosaurs were found during the initial construction of Rutland Water in the 1970s, experts said that it was unusual to find a specimen of this kind in the Midlands. Remains are usually found across the Jurassic and Yorkshire coast.“To put this find into context for the public in the world of British palaeontology, the discovery is like finding a complete Tyrannosaurus rex out in the Badlands of America, only this Jurassic giant was found in a nature reserve in Rutland, of all places. It is a truly unprecedented discovery and one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history,” Dr Lomax said.Scientists are now securing funding to clean and repair the skeleton before it is put on display.Dr Mark Evans of the British Antarctic Survey said: “I’ve been studying the Jurassic fossil reptiles of Rutland and Leicestershire for over 20 years. When I first saw the initial exposure of the specimen with Joe Davis I could tell that it was the largest ichthyosaur known from either county. However, it was only after our exploratory dig that we realised that it was practically complete to the tip of the tail.”He added: “It’s a highly significant discovery both nationally and internationally but also of huge importance to the people of Rutland and the surrounding area.”Nigel Larkin, a specialist palaeontological conservator, said: “It’s not often you are responsible for safely lifting a very important but very fragile fossil weighing that much.“It is a responsibility, but I love a challenge. It was a very complex operation to uncover, record, and collect this important specimen safely.”The excavation of the remains will feature on BBC Two’s Digging For Britain on Tuesday at 8pm.More from NewsBusinessman ‘threw chocolate at passengers and attacked BA crew in drunken rampage’Scots could wear face masks for years under Nicola Sturgeon’s plan for living with CovidUltra low rates have created a new generation addicted to debtEx-Tory MP who raped wife told her \u0026#39everyone thinks I\u0026#39m fabulous\u0026#39 and no one will believe you, it is claimedScottish universities drop out of Stonewall equality league tables following ‘gender’ rowSett for life as badgers root out Roman coin hoardMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jurassic spark new generation dinosaur hunters uncovering britains","story":"It has been described as one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history: the skeleton of a 180-million-year-old ichthyosaur, discovered in Rutland Water during the routine draining of a lagoon island last February, and dug out by a team of palaeontologists in August and September.Tomorrow night (Tuesday, Jan 11), the excavation of the remains of this 10-metre “sea dragon” will feature on BBC Two’s Digging for Britain, reminding the public of what lies beneath our small island: buried treasures, the unearthing of which can yield so many secrets about our prehistory. For although the surface area of Britain is modest, our geology is erse. The opportunities to find fossils from a range of different time periods are great.Good places to look are around the rocks of Surrey, Sussex and the Isle of Wight, which date from the early Cretaceous period and were deposited 120 to 140 million years ago by rivers and on flood plains. If it weren’t for the fact these areas are covered in houses and trees – and if our climate were somewhat warmer and drier – we’d no doubt be finding as many dinosaurs here as they do in the arid American state of Utah.Yet despite our damp climate and developed land, we live in a golden age of palaeontological discovery – and also of interest in prehistory, which, of course, is linked. The UK has a long historical association with fossil-hunting and palaeontology. The first dinosaur fossils that were recognised as such were found in this country: a collection of big teeth spotted in rocks by the side of a road in Sussex in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell and her husband, Gideon. It was Richard Owen, a British scientist, who later coined the term “dinosauria”, meaning “terrible lizards”. The teeth were the first evidence of a dinosaur known as Iguanodon.There followed a 19th-century fossil-hunting craze in Britain among Victorian gentlemen naturalists. Its legacy is found in the Natural History Museum, where we have today a large dinosaur collection from countries including Canada and from southern Africa.Until the start of the Second World War, dinosaurs fascinated the British. Our interest seems to have waned after that, until the mid-1990s, when our interest in these primal and often terrifying beasts was reignited. I was 13 when Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster Jurassic Park was released in 1993. Although I knew I wanted to work with dinosaurs, my interest in the subject would have been regarded as niche for a girl in her early teens. The film made it more socially acceptable and mainstream. It made me less weird among my secondary school peers.Now that the Jurassic Park generation has come of age, we are seeing the results of those childhood passions in our universities. During the 15 years that I have worked in the field, there has been an explosion in academic study of vertebrate palaeontology. Several universities now offer undergraduate degrees in the subject, including the universities of Portsmouth, Bristol and Birmingham. While geology courses more often used to cater to students interested in entering, say, the oil or mining industries, today’s geology undergraduates are more interested in bioersity.Yet as in the case of the Rutland sea dragon, whose remains were found by Joe Davis, an employee of the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust, many palaeontological finds are opportunistic – that is, not made by professionals. The UK today has a large community of amateur fossil-hunters, who are out there looking for fossils, sometimes on a daily basis. They visit the brick pits around Peterborough, or the cliffs of the Isle of Wight, particularly in winter when the storms roll in and the rocks become unstable and can collapse.There are no special techniques to fossil-finding. We just have to use an ancient tool: our eyes. But we have to know where to look.So what has this golden age of palaeontological discovery actually yielded? Quite a lot, really. Last year saw not only the unearthing of the Rutland sea dragon, but also a huge Jurassic seabed in a Cotswolds quarry, where colleagues have discovered a beautifully preserved haul of fossil sea urchins, starfish, sea lilies and feather stars.The remains of two dinosaurs that lived about 125 million years ago and were found on the Isle of Wight were identified in September and named Ceratosuchops inferodios – or “horned crocodile-faced hell heron” – and Riparovenator milnerae, a predator with a skull more than 3ft in length.Then in October, we identified Britain’s earliest known carnivorous dinosaur. Named Pendraig milnerae and roughly the size of a chicken, this creature had been found in Carmarthenshire in Wales in the 1950s and entered our collection in the 1960s. But it wasn’t until last year that, after comparison with better known specimens from around the world, we discovered it was new and deserved to be recognised as a type of dinosaur in its own right.In November, other fossils found on the Isle of Wight were identified as another new species, called Brighstoneus simmondsi. The defining characteristic of this eight-metre long herbivore was its bulbous nose.Behind the Isle of Wight finds was a retired GP called Jeremy Lockwood, who has spent much of the pandemic hunting for fossils on the beach and is studying part-time for a PhD at the University of Portsmouth and the Natural History Museum. He may not be the only one who has spent these past two years in fruitful palaeontological employ. With a boom in “staycations” – including on the Jurassic coast of southern England – it’s possible there has been something of a pandemic boom in dinosaur hunting. And, from our point of view, the more eyes on the ground the better. The more discoveries by amateurs this heightened interest turns up, the more detailed a picture we can build of our prehistory.So far we have barely scratched the surface. From the start of the Jurassic period to the end of the Cretaceous is a time of 140 million years. During this, everything that lived on land and was larger than a metre in size was a dinosaur. So that is 140 million years of animals evolving, dying and going extinct. Most of their remains will not have become fossils. Many of those that did are yet to be discovered, as vast portions of the world remain very little studied. In Africa, South America and parts of central Asia, prehistory is underexplored and there remain huge geographic areas where we don’t really know what was living there.

Rumours are flying that Jeremy Corbyn, still deprived of the Labour whip at Westminster and therefore unable to submit himself as an official candidate ahead of the next general election, is about to launch a new party.Naturally this is being seen as dreadful news for Corbyn’s successor as Labour leader, Keir Starmer: splits, which are far more common on the British Left than on the Right, tend to presage a significant electoral defeat for the party. See 1983 and 2019.There’s no escaping the fact that a new party emerging from Corbyn’s recently launched Peace and Justice Project would pose some organisational and presentational difficulties for Starmer. But there is far more to be gained from such a split, and those who want to see a Labour government in our lifetime should keep their fingers crossed that the rumour mill, on this occasion, is accurate.The root of Corbyn’s grievance is obvious: any MP deprived of the party whip cannot be considered by his or her local party as an official candidate. Naturally, Starmer wants rid of Corbyn from the Parliamentary Labour Party, but that simply wasn’t going to happen if he trusted the judgment of local members in Islington North. Pressing the nuclear button of expulsion would provoke a massive backlash, so deprivation of the whip until after the next general election is an effective, unchallengeable tactic that will serve Starmer’s ends.It\u0027s rumoured that the former Labour MP Mary Creagh, who famously confronted Corbyn for his performance as leader after she lost her Wakefield seat at the 2019 election, is now rumoured to be the leadership’s preferred candidate to replace Corbyn in Islington North – a move that is 100 per cent guaranteed to infuriate Corbyn’s supporters across the country.The hard Left, of which Corbyn remains the figurehead, have been itching for an opportunity to throw a punch at Starmer and the Labour Party and there are many who would relish the prospect of Corbyn standing as an independent against the official Labour candidate — a contest Corbyn would be likely to win.But even this scenario has more upsides than downsides for Starmer. He needs to show that he is in charge of the party and that his promise of a zero tolerance approach to anti-Semitism is being honoured. Corbyn, whose ill-judged comments about the inquiry into anti-Semitism in Labour by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) led directly to his suspension, remains an embarrassment to Labour so long as he sits in Parliament. If he is there as an independent with his own mandate, Starmer can legitimately disown all responsibility for his presence.And there are plenty in Labour who would welcome the setting up of an entirely new party committed to the kind of anti-West, hard Left economic policies that Corbyn has stood for throughout his career — some because they might be interested in signing up, but many more because they would finally be rid of shouty activists who seem to have more in common with the Socialist Workers’ Party than with a moderate Labour Party committed to change through the democratic and parliamentary process.Such a split should, by rights, have happened long before now there is precious little common ground between centrist Labour and Corbyn’s hard Left, other than a loathing of the common enemy. They disagree fundamentally on defence, on the economy and on foreign policy, especially with regard to Israel and the Middle East. A orce would allow each side to live more happily apart. The reason such a split has never happened is nothing to do with loyalty to the Labour brand or an affection for its history and legacy it is because the current electoral system is guaranteed to kill any splinter group, either immediately or within a very few years. It’s why so many on the hard Left are advocates of electoral reform, which they hope would guarantee at least some representation for a committed Marxist faction. Introducing the single transferable vote would, moreover, have the added attraction of relieving the main party of the need to reform its policies in order to win new voters. Post-polling day alliances could be formed — even between Labour and its former comrades — that would both veto any future Conservative government while allowing unreconstructed socialists to get into government.That’s the theory anyway. That any new Corbyn-led party might be launched before electoral reform is secured says a lot about how desperate the hard Left is. They have never been short of belief in their own philosophy and a conviction that the electorate would embrace them if only they weren’t so stupid and greedy. Like the SDP in 1981, perhaps they believe they can break the mould of British politics with a display of chutzpah and razzamatazz and a decent showing in the odd by-election.Until a split happens (and sadly, it may not), Starmer will continue to feel he is somehow in thrall to his own Left wing, convinced he must continue to throw the occasional morsel to those who once voted for Corbyn but who, perhaps reluctantly, supported his leadership bid in 2020. But imagine a world where a significant number of those party members threw their lot in with the People’s Movement for Peace, Justice and Kindness (trademark pending), where Starmer no longer had to put up with internal criticism every time he praised the record of the last Labour government or supported Sir Tony Blair’s knighthood. What new, innovative policies could Labour develop once it was free from the tyranny of having to sate the socialist appetite of those who can never be satisfied?Imagine having the freedom to campaign for a Labour government without having to worry about those who believe that any Labour Party that is popular with the British people is, by definition, a Labour Party that has sold out.Starmer and his team should adopt a poker faced approach to the prospect of a Corbyn split. In public they should say all the right things — regret, what a shame, best of luck, etc — and confine their glee to private occasions. The new party that would be born from Corbyn’s defection would not be his own it would be the Labour Party.More from NewsRow erupts over Special Boat Service ‘using run-down pool’ to train for combatBusinessman ‘threw chocolate at passengers and attacked BA crew in drunken rampage’Scots could wear face masks for years under Nicola Sturgeon’s plan for living with CovidUltra low rates have created a new generation addicted to debtEx-Tory MP who raped wife told her \u0026#39everyone thinks I\u0026#39m fabulous\u0026#39 and no one will believe you, it is claimedScottish universities drop out of Stonewall equality league tables following ‘gender’ rowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"labours plan devolution exactly britain doesnt need","story":"Sir Keir Starmer has recently been on a mission to persuade the voters that, unlike his predecessor, he actually quite likes the United Kingdom. The Union Jack has started cropping up in his videos. Harmless if insubstantial bromides about his pride in this country have appeared in his speeches. All basic, but nonetheless important: there are few things Labour politicians can do to make life easy for the Conservatives than allowing them to turn Is Britain a good thing? into a wedge issue.But the tough bit as ever is following up word with deed. And when it comes to policy, alas, it looks as if Starmer doesn’t actually think very much of this country at all.How else to explain the fact that he seems to be getting ready to endorse Gordon Brown’s proposals for devo-max?If you’re unfamiliar with the term, it involves devolving the maximum powers you possibly can to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland whilst maintaining the technical existence of the UK. According to media reports, the former Prime Minister plans to limit the role of the British Government to areas such as “foreign affairs and defence” pretty much everything else gets included in “further sweeping powers to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland”.Which raises an obvious challenge to Starmer’s patriotic protestations: if you think this country is such a good thing, why do you want to remove it so completely from the day-to-day lives of its citizens?Even on a tactical level, the logic is abysmal. Labour’s decades-long effort to triangulate its way past the SNP has yielded nothing but retreat and defeat. And by meeting every Nationalist success with promises to further hollow out the British state, the Opposition has wound up asking voters to reject the separatists’ conclusions whilst accepting their most fundamental and dangerous premises.To the surprise of nobody but Labour, this attempt to muddle through hasn’t worked. The Party now offers an unconvincing spectacle to voters on either side of Scotland’s constitutional ide – and by flirting with major concessions remains wide open in England to the Tory charge of selling the national silver to the SNP.But the problems with ‘devo-max’ go well beyond tactics. It strikes to the heart of a much more fundamental strategic question, which is that it is increasingly difficult to make the case for a Union that doesn’t do anything.Imagine a future referendum on Scottish independence, sometime after Labour have enacted these reforms. A pro-UK activist knocks on a door, and the voter presses them on what being part of the UK means for the issues that really matter to them.The NHS? “Oh, that’s devolved.” What about the under-performing schools? “Sorry, devolved too.” Well, at least there’s that ‘pooling and sharing’ they’ve heard so much about? “Well actually, since we devolved so many tax powers there are far fewer fiscal transfers these days.”We’re not living through the Cold War anymore most voters are not greatly exercised by foreign affairs and defence. Brown’s plan involves stripping out more and more positive reasons for anyone to vote for the UK, leaving in place only a negative one: “But it does so little, why bother to leave?”Britain needs, and deserves, a left-wing party that believes in it, and recognises the hugely valuable role it has to play in making sure every British citizen can access the services and opportunities they deserve. Instead Labour, incapable of admitting fault or subjecting its own politicians to critical scrutiny, seems condemned to keep having its one idea over and over again and hoping that this time, somehow, it will produce a different result. More from NewsRow erupts over Special Boat Service ‘using run-down pool’ to train for combatBusinessman ‘threw chocolate at passengers and attacked BA crew in drunken rampage’Scots could wear face masks for years under Nicola Sturgeon’s plan for living with CovidUltra low rates have created a new generation addicted to debtEx-Tory MP who raped wife told her \u0026#39everyone thinks I\u0026#39m fabulous\u0026#39 and no one will believe you, it is claimedScottish universities drop out of Stonewall equality league tables following ‘gender’ rowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"four ways make your christmas","story":"Four ways to make your Christmas with loved ones safer according to GPWe can still have a great time together – just follow these tips to help protect loved ones from the new Covid- strainthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-numbers-uk-records--,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:ceaefcdbe,sourceUrl:Copied from RSC,site:Mirror,brandSafety: General news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:dtzrPE,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Close contact with others – especially in unventilated spaces – increases your chances of spreading Covid-. If you’re spending the festive season with loved ones there are lots of ways you can reduce the risk, including taking regular rapid lateral flow tests, letting fresh air in and getting your booster. GP Dr Claire Ashley provides some simple tips for staying safe so you and those close to you can gather round the table and enjoy your Christmas fun. Take those tests  Meeting up with loved ones  You should all do a rapid lateral flow test before you mingle.They’re free, easy to do at home and the results show in half an hour – to order a pack, go to nhs.uk get-tested.“If you haven’t got any symptoms, rapid lateral flow tests are very good at picking up Covid-,” says Dr Ashley, based in the South West. “On Christmas morning, before granny comes over for lunch, taking a test is the best way to check you’re not infectious. “My family will all have a rapid lateral flow test the morning we travel down to see my parents, andanything comes back positive, or any of us has symptoms, we won’t go. “I’m aware our plans might be disrupted. It’s not perfect, especially after last year, but I’d rather everyone stays safe.”  As Dr Ashley points out, rapid lateral flow tests are designed to pick up Covid- cases with no symptoms, soyou do have symptoms such as a fever, cough or loss of sense of taste or smell, you need to isolate immediately and take a PCR test. Andyour rapid lateral flow test does show a positive result, you’ll need to isolate and only leave the house to take a PCR test to confirm it.If you have been in contact with someone with Covid- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. If you test positive or develop symptoms in those seven days, you must self-isolate, take a PCR test and follow the guidance on gov.uk.If you are unvaccinated, you must self-isolate for  daysyou are in contact with someone who has Covid-.Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive, so keep it on.Open the window sLetting fresh air into your home is one way to help reduce the spread of Covid-. Opening windows and doors for just  minutes will help. “Covid- is an airborne virus and the research suggests that when you’re in a well-ventilated space the risk of contracting it is reduced,” says Dr Ashley. “That’s why being outdoors is much more safe, but that’s tricky when it’s very cold. Soyou want to reduce the chances of Covid- being passed on, have the windows open so you get as much airflow as possible.” Wear a face covering You must wear a face covering in public areas such as shops, places of worship, entertainment venues, and on public transport. It’s wise to wear a mask in crowded or enclosed spaces, eventhey’re not legally required. “Face coverings are really effective at reducing how much you’re spreading Covid-,” explains Dr Ashley. Get your booster Every adult in the country now needs to get a Covid- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Book yours now at nhs.uk covidvaccination.Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent than ever before with Covid- because Omicron is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a Covid- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.If you haven’t had your first or second vaccine, go to nhs.uk covidvaccination or call  to book it, or find your nearest walk-in centre.“It’s also very important for pregnant women to get vaccinated,” adds Dr Ashley. “The benefits of being vaccinated and boosted really outweigh the risks.”People with lower immune systems might need to be more careful about socialising this Christmas, as they could have less protection against getting severely ill with Covid-. This includes people who are taking medication that suppresses the immune system – eg, for rheumatoid arthritis – and those having chemotherapy.

Pepe Di’Iasio’s school in Yorkshire has more than  leaks in the roof, leaving his pupils “cold and wet”. As we launch Levelling up Watch, Mr Di’Iasio said: “Words are cheap, actions speak louder than words.”Mr Di’Iasio dreads the rain. Dreads it because the school roof leaks and staff will be running around classrooms to place buckets to catch the water. It’s just one more problem in a Covid-hit educational world that has caused such anxiety for his pupils that some have turned up drunk for lessons, while others have been traumatised by domestic violence. The school has used all its cash reserves putting support in place. Di’Iasio says: “We’ve done our best to try to prioritise people, not spend money on bricks and mortar.” But the -year-old building is in desperate need of investment.  The clapped-out drains are collapsing, there are cracks in windows caused by subsidence, water comes through the flat roof in at least  places, and the technology building has been closed because it is in such a state. Site manager Martin Smith gives us a tour of Wales High School near Sheffield, South Yorks, and says: “It’s just a nightmare, we’re forever mopping up.” We stop to chat to two caretakers, one has  keys hanging on a chain around his neck as the locks have not been upgraded since the school opened in . The caretakers are fixing a huge fan heater and, with a sigh, one explains: “It’s broken again. Everything is just tired out.”  There are , pupils, aged  to , at the school, where carpets are stained from the leaks and ceiling tiles are missing where caretakers burst them to release the build-up of water. Science teachers were furious last term when water came through and destroyed crucial coursework. But despite the struggles, Mr Di’Iasio and the caretakers could not be more proud of their secondary school and their “amazing” pupils. The devotion of the staff is clear – during lockdown, the kitchen staff and cleaners repainted the whole school. It may not be pretty, but Wales High School, rated “Good” by Ofsted, is so popular parents fight to get their kids places, with at least  appeals every year when admission is refused.  The school tries to keep up with this demand, even converting staff toilets to classrooms. Head of School, Lisa McCall lost half her office to accommodate students. She says: “I can hear the lesson next door and I have to whisperdiscussing anything confidential because of the thin partition.” Mr Di’Iasio invited the Mirror into the school to show how desperately funding is needed. He has seen no sign of the promised levelling up or extra money for schools. He says: “It’s hard to believe we are in the world’s sixth-largest economy. Levelling up is supposed to be the big idea of Boris Johnson’s government.When he was elected in  he pledged to spread opportunity to every corner of the UK. But two years later we are still waiting for the Prime Minister to deliver on his promises. A White Paper setting out the Government’s plan was supposed to have been published this month but has now been shelved until the new year.Many are starting to question whether Mr Johnson is genuinely committed to spreading wealth and opportunity orlevelling up is just an empty slogan. That is why the Mirror is today launching Levelling Up Watch. We intend to hold the Government to account over its plans to improve schools, communities, education and transport. We also want to see any additional money distributed fairly and not just to seats the Tories need to retain to stay in power. What is clear is tinkering with the structure of local government and sprinkling money on piecemeal transport schemes will not be enough. The regional inequality in Britain is not only deep and engrained, it has become starker since the Conservatives came to power in . During that period more than , Sure Start Centres have closed, local councils have seen their funding cut by more than % and the budgets for public health and education have been badly squeezed. The National Audit Office found that since , funding in the most deprived fth of schools fell in real terms by .%, while funding in the fth least deprived schools rose by .%. The additional money announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in his Budget will onlyper pupil funding to  levels. People in poorer areas are likely to have worse health and shorter le expectancy but the budget for Public Health England in - is % – £billion – lower in real terms than in -. Nor can it be right that - transport spending was £ per capita in London, compared to £ in the North East and £ in Yorkshire and Humber. We have heard plenty of words from Mr Johnson about his ambitions to level up but the time for rhetoric is over. We need to see some action.  “We are in a s building and as we speak the rain is pouring down. “I have no doubt that we will have more than five or six dferent leaks, with buckets in classrooms, by the end of the day. We are in a school where children will be cold and wet. “This at a time when we are keeping windows open to allow airflow to prevent the spread of Covid, and the heating is working overtime to keep the temperature at a level you can work and learn in. “Our site staff are brilliant at trying to make do and mend, but the building is creaking and when it rains the flat roof leaks. It has been patched up as much as it possibly can be. “The building is not really fit for purpose and the environment can have a massive impact on learning.”  Mr Di‘Iasio is also dealing with the impact of Covid on his pupils’ mental health. He says: “We are dealing with the fallout from that from a large number of students on a daily basis. “Initially when the students came back they were just so happy to be back, but then things changed and they started exhibiting more extremes of behaviour than we had before. “We had students turning up with alcohol, being under the influence. “We had students who had the police in the house overnight dealing with incidents of domestic violence and we’ve had incidents where students have been suffering from the pressure of the exam process.  “We have spent our money making sure we keep our staff and have enough people to support the students. “There is more money now invested in mental health support and wellbeing.” The school stayed open the first week of the Christmas holidays so pupils could get hot meals. All of the school’s reserves, £,, have now gone. Mr Di‘Iasio says: “The students make the job worthwhile, they make every day a happy day. But it’s when you are looking at the budget and having to make really tough decisions about whether to keep that counsellor or that classroom assistant. They are the darkest days. “But we love our school.” About levelling up, Mr Di‘Iasio says: “I am massively in favour of the concept, but words are cheap and actions speak louder than words. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have invested £. billion since  to enable schools to refurbish their buildings, including £. billion in - alone.On top of this, our new ten-year School Rebuilding Programme to transform  schools is underway and will improve the education of tens of thousands of children as we level up across the UK.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsMental healthSecondary schoolLevelling Up Watch\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

There have been dficulties keeping track of case numbers in recent weeks due to shortages of lateral flow testsand polymerase chain reactiontests. Despite this, case numbers have remained high and have reached record levels since the Omicron iant took a hold on the country. The UKaposs official Covid death toll passed , on Saturday January . Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs government is currently drawing up plan for a living with Covid strategy, which aims to avoid any long-term restrictions in England from March this year.The proposed rule changes may seem like a contradiction to some, so what are they and who do they affect  What is the PCR test rule change   Currently, people who test positive for Covid with no symptoms on a lateral flow test are required to take a PCR to confirm their status. This will change from January .They will still have to isolate for at least seven days, but only from the date of their positive lateral flow test.Head of Imperial College Londonaposs Department of Primary Care  Public Health, Professor Azeem Majeed told the i that the move is a positive step. He said: If you’re positive on lateral flow teststhat’s almost certainly diagnostic of a Covid- infection in the current situation we’re in, as infection rates are so high.By not then having to take a PCR test, it takes pressure off the PCR testing system. What should I doI have a positive LFT   Anyone who tests positive for the virus through an LFT should report their status immediately. The UK Health Security Agencyhas given guidance of how to do this and what will occur afterwards.They said: Under this new approach, anyone who receives a positive LFD test result should report their result on Gov.UK and must self-isolate immediately but will not need to take a follow-up PCR test. At the moment, isolation rules mean that a fully vaccinated person can stop isolating after seven days, proving they take a lateral flow test every day and are negative on days six and seven and have no symptoms. A move to a five-day isolation period is now under consideration. The PM told reporters today: Yes of course, we are looking at that and we will act accordingly to the science as we always have. Is the change to testing permanent   The change brought in has been described as a temporary measure while cases remain high. The UKHSA said: This is a temporary measure while Covid- rates remain high across the UK. Whilst levels of Covid- are high, the vast majority of people with positive [LFT] results can be confident that they have Covid-. The idea is that while cases are in such high numbers, symptoms and a positive test are more likely than normal to indicate the virus. Meanwhile, while case numbers are infrequent and low, a PCR test might be needed to show a positive infection.  The new approach reflects similar changes made this time last year in January , when there was also a high prevalence of infection meaning it was highly likely that a positive [LFT] Covid- result was a true positive. This meant confirmatory PCRs were temporarily paused and reintroduced in March  following a reduction in prevalence.

Oliver Dowden issued the warning moments before the “bring your own booze” bash - which multiple sources claim Boris Johnson attended with his we Carrie. And just five days later, the Prime Minister himself said police should intervene to stop people having outdoor parties. Mr Johnson has been plunged into a fresh scandal over the bash on May , .A bombshell e-mail obtained by ITV News showed more than  No staff were invited by the PM’s top civil servant and told to ‘bring your own booze’.Outdoor gatherings were banned in England at the time under Covid rules. Now footage has emerged of then-Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden speaking at a No press conference, just  minutes before the pm bash out the back door.  He urged hard-pressed citizens to “limit contact with other people”, and said: “You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place - provided that you stay two metres apart. The Cabinet minister warned “staying alert for the vast majority of people still means staying at home as much as possible.”Mr Dowden added: “If everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus.“This is how we can continue to save lives and livelihoods as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.”  Just five days after the outdoor gathering, Boris Johnson said police should intervene to stop outdoor gatherings. He was asked by a member of the public: “There are large groups gathering in local parks, ignoring social distancing rules. When many of us are being so vigilant and staying alert, what can be done to discourage this disregard for the rules ” The PM replied: “Feel free to speak to people yourselfyou feel that they are not obeying the rules. “But the police will step innecessary and encourage people to obey the law. Boris Johnson ’s Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds faces a fight for his job after the May  e-mail was revealed by ITV News. And sources now expect Whitehallaposs parties investigator Sue Gray will have to interview the Prime Minister himself - as he was said to have been present at four of the events she is looking into.In a screenshot of the email obtained by ITV News, Mr Reynolds wrote: Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No garden this evening.Please join us from pm and bring your own booze!According to the BBC, staff raised questions privately at the time with one saying: “Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden ”.Another wrote: “Is this for real ” The May  gathering was revealed last week by ex-Downing Street aideDominic Cummings , who has gone to war with his former boss since leaving Government in November .Hannah Brady, spokesperson for Covid  Bereaved Families for Justice, said: My Dad died just four days before this email was sent out, he was only  and was a fit and healthy key worker.” She added: “How can those running the country have thought it was OK  Could there be a more disgraceful example of aposone rule for them, and another rule for the rest of usapos  “To make matters worse, in September last year I sat in that same Garden, looked the Prime Minister in the eyes and told him how my dad had died. “He told me he had ‘done everything he could’ to protect my Dad, knowing that he had partied in that same spot the very day that Dad’s death certicate was signed. “It makes me feel sick to think about it.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonCabinetCivil servantsPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Kate Grfiths said I am no longer silenced by the family courts” and I can speak out” after a y saga involving her ex Andrew Grfiths. Mr Grfiths used to be the MP for Burton and the minister for small business, and once worked as former prime minister Theresa Mayaposs chief of staff.He resigned in  after the Sunday Mirror revealed he sent depraved messages to two constituents. The Grfiths, both , became embroiled in private family court proceedings, centred on a child, after separating.During those proceedings, a family court judge concluded that, on the balance of probability, Mr Grfiths had raped and physically abused Ms Grfiths.  Ms Grfiths was speaking on a Tortoise Media podcast after Court of Appeal judges ruled the rape finding could be made public. Ms Grfiths said the pair met in  before Mr Grfiths became an MP, and began a relationship  months later. He was great, he was funny, he was a charmer, said Ms Grfiths. I thought he was an all-round good guy. He was very attentive. Ms Grfiths said people would say they were an ideal couple. But she added: By the end of the relationship, I had just become a shadow of my former self. Three appeal judges last month ruled the family court judgeaposs findings could be made public after a -month legal fight by two media organisations - Tortoise and PA Media. Ms Grfiths had waived her right to anonymity and supported the fight by journalists. She said publication would allow her to help constituents. Itaposs like a feeling of freedom, she said. Mr Grfiths had strongly denied allegations made against him, and argued that the family court judgeaposs findings should not be made public. He said the judgeaposs findings should stay private in order to protect the child at the centre of the case. Judges ruled that neither the gender nor the name of the child at the centre of proceedings could be revealed in media reports.

The day-on-day change in the total UK reported cases also masks changes in the separate nations and regions, with some areas of the country now behaving dferently from others.  Cases Looking at the number of new cases by specimen date - when a person actually tested positive, rather than when it was reported - the rate has continued to increase in England and Northern Ireland but may have levelled off in Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland has the highest rate of the four nations, with ,. cases per , people in the seven days to January , according to Government data. This is the highest rate for Northern Ireland since mass testing began in the UK in summer . England is also at a record high, with ,. cases per , people. But the latest figures for Wales and Scotlandare lower than in recent days. Data for cases by specimen date after January  are incomplete, which is why the numbers for January  onwards are not included. Further dferences are evident when looking at case rates for inidual regions in England, with the North West, North East and Yorkshire all now seeing higher rates than London. In north-east England, ,. cases per , people were recorded in the seven days to January , while north-west England recorded . and Yorkshire Humber ... By contrast, London is currently recording ,. cases per ,, below its recent peak of ,. on December . Of the top  highest local authority case rates in England, seven are in north-west Englandwhile the other three are in north-east England .  Hospitals There is a similar north-south ide emerging in hospital numbers.A total of , Covid- patients were in hospital in north-west England as of am on January , the equivalent of  per cent of the regionaposs second-wave peak of , nearly one year earlier.In north-east England and Yorkshire, , patients were recorded on January , or  per cent of its second-wave peak of ,. The percentages are much lower in other regions, however. In London and the Midlands, hospital numbers are currently just under a half what they were at the peak of the second wave , while south-west England and eastern England are about a thirdand south-east England just  per cent, according to analysis by the PA news agency. London, south-east England and south-west England have all seen a drop in Covid- hospital patients in the last few days, while numbers have continued to rise in other regions. Asked on Monday whether the current wave of cases is over in London but not where in the country, Graham Medley, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: I think that at the moment the testing capacity issues, and the Christmas and the new year, mean that we canapost really rely on cases to tell us whataposs going to happen exactly.At the moment we are seeing a relatively high number of admissions how long that continues, whether that goes up or goes down, I think is unknown at the moment. Most regions have seen a week-on-week fall in hospital admissions, though the numbers have dropped only slightly and the long-term trend is not clear. What is clear is that the number of Covid- hospital patients in England in mechanical ventilator beds remains low, with  recorded on January , down from  a week earlier and below the number on December  . This reflects a major dference between the current wave and the wave that hit the UK one year ago.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, described the peak in January  as one that saw hospitals focused on expanding critical care for large numbers of very ill, often older people, needing serious y treatment.The current peak is about expanding general and acute beds for large numbers of people with much milder disease symptoms, he tweeted on Saturday.  Infections The most comprehensive snapshot of how many people in the UK are likely to have Covid- can be found in the weekly infection survey from the Office for National Statistics- and this too suggests there are now dferent trends in the nations and regions. While all parts of the country likely had a record level of infections in the week to December  - the latest available estimate - in London there were early signs in the last few days of  that infections may no longer be increasing, but it is currently too early to suggestthis is a continuing change in trend, the ONS said. London also saw the smallest week-on-week growth in infection rates, up slightly from . per cent to . per cent. But the rate almost doubled in north-east England, from . per cent to . per cent, and more than doubled in north-west England, from . per cent to . per cent Northern Ireland had the lowest percentage of people who were estimated to have Covid- in the week to December while England had the highest , a reverse of the picture suggested by the data for case rates, with Wales on . per cent and Scotland . per cent. The infection survey is based on a sample of swab tests collected from households across the UK and estimates the prevalence of Covid- within the entire community population, regardless of when people caught the virus, how long they have had it, and whether they have symptoms.By contrast, the number of cases of Covid- reported each day by the Government includes only those people who have newly tested positive for the virus, and is therefore affected by how many people are coming forward for tests, or who are taking a test because they know they have coronavirus symptoms.Results from the next infection survey are due to be published on Wednesday and this will give the most reliable guide to- and where - the current surge in coronavirus has peaked.

Today the Daily Mirror takes a detailed look at le in areas the Conservatives claim they now care about. The picture is bleak, with little or no progress since Boris Johnson won an -seat majority at the  General Election. Over-promising and under-delivering is a hallmark of this Prime Minister. The rundown school we highlight today, where heroic teachers and other staff struggle to keep going in crumbling buildings, is unfortunately not an exception. Working people deserve better and the pupils deserve an education in fit-for-purpose facilities. But in this country Government policies are levelling us down instead of up. Staff our NHS  With an understaffed NHS on its knees, axing key staff because they are unvaccinated would be self-destructive. The boss of one of London’s busiest hospitals warning as many as % of his workforce could need moving shows what happens when the tricky real world collides with Whitehall diktat. Of course, those in the health service should be jabbed, to protect patients, colleagues and the public as well as themselves. Yet the no jab, no job order could prove ruinous to the provision of healthcare. Daily pre-work tests are expensive and burdensome but it would surely be better to use them than to lose the skills and expertise of people who, for whatever reason, have failed to get inoculated, or chosen not to. Pitch in, Andy The Duke of York’s ongoing legal troubles in the US civil courts cast a dark shadow over the Queen’s planned Platinum Jubilee celebrations in early June. If Prince Andrew wants to make a positive contribution to the national occasion, he should bake his mum a cake to mark it. It’d be no sweat.

Forget record high NHS waiting lists and crumbling schools when Tory Cabinet Ministers lie in front of giant Union Jacks to illustrate their intense patriotism. And ignore sleaze, corruption, back-handers, unfairness, inequality and fatal mistakes for, with the blessing of Culture Wars Secretary Nadine Dorries, Tory no-mark Andrew Rosindell wants the BBC to play God Save the Queen every day. Statues, flags and anthems are battlegrounds the PM’s smokescreen to ert public attention away from his tax hikes, soaring fuel bills, cost of living rises, stagnant wages and declining public services.  It is a classic, cynical Right-wing strategy to ide and rule. It played well in the past and it might work again. Magicians use misdirection as a form of deception to draw the audience’s attention from the real action. Johnson would rather voters were angry about a jury clearing four protesters over the toppling of slaver Edward Colston’s statue in Bristol than holding the PM to account for increased National Insurance or discussing Labour’s proposed windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to compensate households who are facing huge increases in energy bills.  Suella Braverman is an Attorney-General whose ideological conviction results in much of the legal profession judging her guilty of stupidity. Even considering an appeal against the jury verdict in the Colston case is a sign the governing party will roll in the gutter. Labour leader Keir Starmer is wise to take no lectures on patriotism from a Conservative regime which inflicted the terrible national self-harm that is Brexit. But in a fight, the Labour leader is similarly wise to combat smears which saw predecessor Jeremy Corbyn unfairly tainted as hating his country. Labour wins by keeping the national conversation on big issues that really count, the Tories by changing it to emblems and frippery. Living standards or statues  The election’s choice and verdict will decide whether Britain is a progressive country moving brightly forward or stuck in the past.

Charity Drinkaware has have compiled information on a iety dferent changes you can expect to see in your body across both the long and short term, from superficial changes to appearance to staving off le threatening issues.What are the short term changes you can expect to see when you stop drinking   Youaposll stop getting hangoversThis might sound obvious. No drink, no hangover. But think about what a stinking hangover really feels like: relentless nausea, anxiety, fatigue, headaches, shakes and perhaps even vomiting. Now imagine not feeling any of these things. This is about as shirt term as it comes but its also a way to get a sense of near-instant gratication.Your mental health will improve Drinking heavily and regularly can have impacts on how your brain s. The chemicals in your brain that are vital for good mental health are interfered with when you drink heavily.

Emergency services, including the bomb squad, were called by the hobbyists who found the stash during an event on Sunday . It is believed the devices were long-forgotten railway explosives.Sophie Doyle who runs the Magnetic Pull Facebook group for the fishermen - who use a strong magnet attached to a rope to discover metal objects underwater - told the Manchester Evening News : “The police and the bomb squad were really shocked when they saw the big pile of explosives that we had piled on the floor for them.We werenapost able to identy what model they were, there were so many dferent models of them.  “They had been there for a very long time.” The haul, found in Daisy Nook Country Park near Oldham, was the second found by the group in a week as they also found more than  explosives the weekend before.A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Police said: Officers were called to a report of possible unexploded devices found in a canal in Daisy Nook Country Park in Stannybrook Road, Failsworth, just after .pm on Sunday .

Lisa Jones and her husband Stephen Thomasspotted it on the auction site on a Sunday morning.I came across this milk float that was up for sale, Lisa told MyLondon.I turned to my husband and said: aposWhy donapost we just do it apos The float was built in , but it had been retired from service delivering milk and was still operational.It was for sale for £, on online auction site eBay.Before they could talk themselves out of it, Lisa had bought the milk float and the couple began the task of restoring it.  When it arrived, Thomo began the work before realising it was an enormous undertaking and would require the specialist help of restorer and repairer John Lenehan, based in Oxford. Itaposs like a milk float graveyard, said Lisa. She added: Thereaposs something quite eerie about it - but thereaposs nothing he doesnapost know about. Around a month later, it was ready - and it needed a name. Inspired by comedian Benny Hillaposs song, Ernie , the float was finally christened: Ernie. Itaposs not the fastest milk float in the West, it has to be said, says Lisa. But at  years old, Ernie is still running on his original battery - managing a modest  miles per hour and with the potential to travel for up to  miles before needing to be charged. Ernie can even make it up Muswell Hill in London, where the couple are based, but is often overtaken by pedestrians.  Lisa added: Thataposs all it needs, and itaposs been chugging on for  years, which I just find incredible. Ernieaposs purchase might have been spontaneous, but it was part of a grand plan Lisa and Thomo had been hatching throughout lockdown. Like lots of other people, my husband and I looked around us and started to reassess on so many levels - our lives, our working lives, wanting to do something dferent, wanting to do something which contributed and to get involved with our community a bit more, says Lisa. We looked around at what was happening to the planet while we were in lockdown and this sort of tentative attempt to heal itself...dolphins coming back to the Venetian harbour - all of this was incredible. It just goes to show that this is reversible we can change things. Thomo is an IT consultant and Lisa had been working as a food and drink PR and journalist, where sheaposd noticed a sht towards sustainability and independent, ethically-sourced products. They decided to combine their skills, with Lisa scaling back her work to concentrate on the project full-time.In August last year, they launched The Peopleaposs Pantry, a zero-waste mobile refill store and delivery service selling over  ethically-sourced products —including cereals, pasta, pulses, spices, cleaning products and household essentials— around eight North London postcodes.Lisa added: This is our small way of trying to be part of the solution. Thataposs all it needs, and itaposs been chugging on for  years, which I just find incredible, says Lisa.  She said: Itaposs in a small way, of course, but I think itaposs amazing - once you start doing something small like monitoring how much plastic you use, you suddenly become very aware of everything  that youaposre not doing. Hopefully itaposs going to be a stepping stone for people to reassess other areas of their lives as well - whether thataposs not flying as often, or getting on a bike rather than taking the car. With s Ernie and the companyaposs focus on community, The Peopleaposs Pantry trades on an element of nostalgia. Thereaposs a kind of nostalgia at the moment when the future is so crazy. I think weaposre all looking back to simpler, more wholesome, more manageable times, which has fuelled the vintage vibe.  She adds: I think people have been looking for ways to make a dference - but also ways to engage with each other. I think that was one of the very few positives to come out of the pandemic. Weaposve recognised how important community is and we started meeting our neighbours. Lisa is right. With the emergence of Mutual Aid and community groups during the pandemic, people began to connect with others around them in the first few months of the pandemic.According to a study by the ONS, over halfof adults said that friends, family and neighbours had offered to help themthey became unwell, rising to .% for over s.But,  months on, is this increased sense of community still catching on We hoped that the street visits would become this very social event and that neighbours would come and meet each other and put faces to WhatsApp feeds. And thataposs exactly whataposs happened, says Lisa. Itaposs something we werenapost entirely expecting.Five months into their venture, Lisa says that the reception to The Peopleaposs Pantry has been positive, with locals keen to contribute. Theyaposve seen innovative refillable solutions, including a woman who makes bags out of her sonaposs outgrown T-shirts, and a customer who has refilled an old bag of Sainsburyaposs basmati rice five times. Others have been willing to donate excess supplies - including, says Lisa, a customer with spare fertiliser from his wormery. Thataposs really uplting - itaposs exactly what we want it to be about. Ernie, meanwhile, has developed a following. Heaposs recognised in the street and was even sewn a Father Christmas hat by a neighbour. Heaposs developed a kind of personality of his own - heaposs like this comedy character with a serious soul, laughs Lisa. On a personal level, Lisa and Thomo have enjoyed working together. Thomo has built an e-commerce site for the company and has been working on an app. Actually, it was not a bad thing for our marriage, because you suddenly realise the strengths and skills that you donapost ordinarily see in each other because youaposre working in dferent fields...Iaposve been amazed at what heaposs able to do, she says. The couple have four children, with ying degrees of enthusiasm for their enterprise. Lisa says their eldest daughter recently told her she was pleased theyaposd launched the business because it had increased her own awareness and encouraged her to start conversations about sustainability at university. Their son is helping out with packing and deliveries - but insists on keeping some distance from Ernie. Theyaposre all really supportive. They love the idea - as long as they donapost have to be seen sitting in Ernie. Lisa feels that her career change was the right choice for her. I am pleased I made a change and Iaposm really enjoying it, she says. It does consume our week - but it doesnapost really matter when youaposre doing something that you enjoy. For the moment, Lisa and Thomo are concentrating on their own community, where they have lived for  years. But Lisa is not ruling out the possibility of more Ernies in future - coming, perhaps, to a community near you.

There are  abandoned Tube stations, with some converted into flats, but many are disused and provide an ideal environment for filming. This makes them an ideal location for film crew seeking somewhere more dingy.But MyLondon says the “exclusive spaces” are not open to the public and will really cost anyone who wants to hire them. Any film or TV series will feature the Underground at some point, but plenty of filmmakers want something darker or abandoned. London has at least  abandoned Tube stations, and while some have been converted into flats or even an escape room, many of them really are abandoned and disused. This makes them the perfect location for film producers seeking somewhere discreet to film.  But hiring the “exclusive spaces” that the public cannot access will really cost you. We have several exclusive areas,” says the TfL guide, “Aldwych, Bankand Charing Cross.” Aldwych “has the most flexible access and does not have any restrictions with timings” - which makes sense, since it was closed in . Many films and TV series have been shot there, including Sherlock, Atonement, V for Vendetta and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.  One  on the Waterloo  City Line branch of Bank station can be made available - as it was to the crew of the film Sliding Doors - plus a ticket hallyou want to film on a Sunday, as it’s closed. Since the Jubilee line stopped its service to Charing Cross in , the two disused s and three escalators are “completely segregated from the rest of the station” and, for an extra charge, bulky equipment can be brought to the station during off-peak hours on a specially-organised train.  Charing Cross has been used for films such as  Weeks Later and Skyfall and others such as Killing Eve and Spooks. But hiring an underground station is not cheap and will cost film producers who want to. “Charges for exclusive areas currently start at £, an hourfor the station or £, an hourwith the additional use of your own train.” But an abandoned Tube station where people wonapost be inconvenienced could cost that much per hour. Locations would rather you didn’t use their electricity. The Film Office says they generally request that film crews use battery-operated equipment as they operate on a dferent voltage system to the standard domestic set-up and connections to their power supply must be supervised by a specialist electrician.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON London NewsLondon Underground\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, she adds the Duchess of Cambridge will be keen not to upstage CamillaKate Middleton photographed to mark her th birthday Image: Paolo Roversi Kensington PalaceByEmily RetterSenior Feature Writer:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | comments While the photo that snatched the headlines this weekend was dynamic Kate at  in sizzling red, it was the subtler profile shot in white which spoke a thousand words about the Duchess’s burgeoning royal status.While her profile is delicate, her expression soft as the tulle of her dress, and her curls whimsically blowing in the breeze of a wind machine, there is a strength about the romantic photograph which shouts queen-in-waiting. The pose is far from new. It is one which has been used repeatedly down the decades to capture a young princess or duchess coming of age, their elegant footing firm on the path to queendom. As well as by female monarchs well established in their reign. Queen Victoria, Queen Mary, the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret, Diana, even Princess Grace of Monaco, not to mention our current Queen, have struck similar poses. The combination of romanticism and regality is recognisable straightaway as Kate holds a mirror to former eras. Royal commentator Ingrid Seward explains: “In this image I think you see a nod to Kate rising up the ranks. People look at her and see the perfect queen, young and beautul. “It evokes an image of the Queen as a young woman and even conjures up historically a Boadicea, strong, yet feminine - femininity yet strength. “That idealised image of a young queen, serene, in control and poised.” She adds: “Kate is coming into her own. She is genuinely involved in her charity work, which will be her legacy. “We have seen her in the peacemaker role between William and Harry, we saw her at the carol concert in Westminster stepping confidently into the spotlight, she is no longer a clothes horse, there is a strength there now. “We can see Kate stepping up a level, the coming of a queen in waiting, and I think she is more ready to fill those shoes.” But she stresses the Duchess will no doubt feel embarrassed by the attention on her position. She’s been in The Firm long enough to know she must not overstep the mark. “Prince Charles is not even King yet and the Royals are very careful about not upstaging each other. Kate will be keen not to upstage Camilla,” says Ingrid. “She is aware of hierarchy and that it is Camilla’s turn. “But she is a wonderful advert for the monarchy, especially globally, and people will see her as the perfect queen.”  Platinum puddings By Tyrese ChinDenCoy What better way to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee this year than with cake  Her Maj has decreed a Royal Bake Off, asking the nation to come up with a pud we can all raise a spoon to. Fortnum and Mason and The Big Jubilee Lunch invite Britain’s bakers, aged eight and above, to create a dish that can be replicated across the country to celebrate the -year milestone.  Five finalists will have the chance to bake their dishes at Fortnum’s store in Piccadilly to be judged by Dame Mary Berry, palace head chef Mark Flanagan and Masterchef list Monica Galetti. Why not take some inspiration from Royal favourites, old or new  From Prince William’s chocolate biscuit cake to Henry the VIII’s favourite red wine and ginger jelly or Queen Victoria’s famous Victoria Sponge, they’re a family of sweet tooths. Henry VIII Favourite Food: Jelly Hippocras. Henry VIII was a large man and would often have over  freshly cooked dishes served for him every day. He loved his red wine and even built two fountains which spouted hundreds of gallons of the stuff for him and his courtiers to enjoy everyday. Alongside it, Henry particularly liked this jelly which included wine, ginger and cinnamon. Victoria I Favourite Food: Victoria Sponge Cake Queen Victoria was someone who enjoyed eating and was said to have had a hearty appetite. She enjoyed sweet foods from ice-creams to pastries, and cake so much that the Victoria Sponge was named after her. Duchess Kate Favourite Food: Sticky Toffee Pudding Kate’s fav foods reportedly include sushi and Italian - the latter because it’s easy to cook with ther kids and let them get their hands messy. But when it comes to favourite puds it’s a spongy Sticky Toffee Pudding. Prince William Favourite Food: Chocolate biscuit cake The Duke is a big fan of chocolate biscuit cakes, so much so the cake was served at his wedding. William’s fondness for the cake apparently comes from a specic recipe which he learnt from his grandmother, the Queen.

She is thought to have spent the day of her birthday yesterday privately with her family having a low-key celebration.And this could have suited Kate perfectly, who even in her university days wasnapost one for tearing the town up and could apparently nurse one glass of wine all night. In her book Kate: The Future Queen, royal author Katie Nicholl speaks to an unnamed friend, who joined Kate on a gap year trip to Italy. The friend claimed: Sheaposd get giggly and silly after a few glasses, so then she would stop.  She was never interested in getting really drunk. She wasnapost really a party girl. She wasnapost uptight or boring, she was really fun and lovely, but going out and getting wasted wasnapost really her thing.But one party she wasnapost able to get out of having was her hen party in , shortly before marrying Prince William.Kateaposs sister Pippa reportedly organised a private do at the house of a friend, with the guest list kept to a minimum.

Writing in her autobiography, Cheryl revealed how she bumped into William backstage at the Queenaposs Diamond Jubilee concert in  and he cheekily joked: “Did you know you’ve got a bit of competition ” According to Cheryl, the couple started giggling before Kate admitted sheaposd performed the staraposs  hit at her hen do.  The former Girls Aloud star writes in her autobiography Cheryl My Story: Kate confessed that she dressed up as me on her hen night, in a bodysuit and split trousers, and sang Fight For This Love. She even learnt the dance routine and was step-perfect by all accounts, as her sister Pippa and brother James also came over and told me all about it.However, despite missing out on a big birthday bash, Kate could have a joint th party with William later in the year.  The Queen is expected to throw William a party for his own th in June, with Windsor Castle or Sandringham among the likely venues.Similar lavish bashes have previously been thrown to jointly celebrate signicant birthdays of several members of the family at the same time. Back in June , a huge do was held at Windsor to celebrate Prince Andrew’s th birthday, Princess Anne’s th, Princess Margaret’s th and William’s th. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, said she expects the Queen will play a major role in the planning of the party for William. Ingrid said: “The Queen is tremendously fond of enjoying such occasions and this would be no dferent. “There’s a lot to look forward to in her Platinum Jubilee year, and with both William and Kate turning  it’s an extra excuse to celebrate. “This is a pretty big one for the Cambridges so it should be quite the party.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeCherylPrince WilliamRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Most dogs, however, love dashing out for some good exercise, and only need to hear ‘do you wanna go for a…’ before bounding around in excitement. Dogs can help to maintain a healthy lestyle, heading out on daily walks and adventures - but some are more up to it than others.Andyou’re considering getting a dog to be your training buddy and running partner, it’s important to do your research and say, not get bichon frise.That said, while all dog breeds need exercise, some require more physical activity than others, andViovethave pulled together a list of the most physically active dogs who will relish the opportunity to join you on your outdoor activities.Here are five of the most active breeds that love nothing more than a good run or two: Labrador Golden Retriever  Hands down one of the most loved and popular dog breeds, the Labrador is a very friendly dog that requires a lot of physical activity. Alongside frequent walks by the beach or in the countryside, it also enjoys playing fetch and splashing about in water. Similarly, golden retrievers have a soft spot for swimming too. Both very active and clever, they can easily engage in strenuous activities – so make sure you make allowances for that. Dalmatian  Dalmatians are great exercisers and ideally need two hours of physical activity per day. Once used as ‘carriage dogs’ to guard the passengers and reassure the horses in the stable at night, running long distances is in their DNA. While not the quickest of sprinters, Dalmatians have tonnes of energy. They will truly benefit from long trots in the countryside and mentally stimulating activities. Siberian husky  There is no hiding that it is dficult to tire out a Siberian husky. Usually bred to pull heavy sledges and travel long distances in challenging climates, this dog breed has buckets of energy. A Siberian husky that is not adequately exercised may cause some mischief in the home. Therefore, it is important to schedule a daily two-hour walk or run and allow them to enjoy some satisfactory physical activity. German shepherd  Bright, strong and obedient, it’s no wonder that German shepherds are often used in police forces. They are very loyal companions that are not well-suited to apartment le and require at least a couple of hours of exercise every day. Get them stuck in engaging and physically demanding activities – you will soon discover that they are great fun to both train and go on adventures with. Border collie  If you ever asked a class of dog breeds whether they enjoy working, border collies will be the first to raise their paw. Often involved in sheep herding, these pooches are always on the move and are quick to complete their tasks. To keep them physically and mentally stimulated, make sure to provide them with lots of exercise. With all that energy, it takes quite a while to wear them out. The five least active breeds Some dogs simply weren’t bred to be workers or long distance runners, andthis kind of dog suits your lestyle better, then here are some suitable canine candidates. Maltese  They may well be intelligent and energetic dogs, but the little Maltese is more than satisfied with a -minute walk down the road or a short run in the garden. Indeed, it is plenty of exercise for this adorable dog breed. Once the pampered babies of noble ladies of the Roman Empire, it is no surprise that the little Maltese enjoys relaxing in its cosy abode. Chihuahua  Tiny and loud, chihuahuas are small dogs with big attitudes and huge personalities. Weighing just under three kilos on average, it goes without saying that they do not need hours and hours of physical activity. A stroll in the park will do the job, and they will then be ready to head back home without any complaints. Bichon frise  More than happy to sit on your lap and be stroked all day, the cloud-like bichon frise is the perfect companion for elderly owners or dog lovers with mobility issues. A short, half-an-hour daily walk is all the bichon frise asks for, and will quite gladly spend the rest of their day grooming its fluffy curls. Chow Chow  Famous for their friendly and wrinkly face, the Chow Chow is the perfect cuddly companion for a night in. They are also good dogs for people who have very busy routines, as they only require one walk per day to keep in shape and to socialise with fellow pooches. Moreover, they tend to be quite independent. This means that you do not need to stimulate them as much to keep them entertained. King Charles Spaniel  Possibly one of the most regal-looking breed dogs out there, King Charles spaniels enjoy sitting on their throne most of the time. Due to their generally relaxed nature, there is no need to take them on kilometric walks – short strolls will do just fine. That said, they also love some playtime and being around both adults and children. Ultimately, it is vital to always find time for your dogs to engage in some deserved physical activities. Some friendly companions require lots of exercise others, not so much. With this list at hand, you will be able to discover what dog breed suits your lestyle best without compromising on their all-important daily ‘walkies’.

Gavin Quinn, a sports reporter, lost five stone in seven months with regular meals and exercise. The feat is even more astonishing because he did not once go to the gym during his weight loss journey. He puts his remarkable loss down to a combination of diet and exercise. Gavin, who writes for the Irish Mirror, shed the weight in seven months, but rewarded himself with some snacks along the way. BelfastLive reports that he had started to gain weight when he was a teenager.He said: I lost  poundsin seven months after deciding to make a change in October .Tipping the scales at around  stone, I wasnapost massively overweight but Iaposd noticed a gradual increase since I was a teenager that was accelerated by the initial Covid- lockdown.I looked into what I was eating and slowly turned around my diet and found cycling as a great way to get active to complement the changes Iaposd made. By Christmas I had lost over two stone and I kept it up in the New Year before hitting the five stone mark in May .  Gavinaposs weight continued to fall to  stoneand he eased off and worked on fitness goals rather than weight. He said for some people this was an epiphany moment similar to a favourite shirt no longer fitting them. Gavin added: But for me it was just a culmination of all the right things, I donapost have any overriding reason for making a change. At the time Ireland was staring at another Covid- lockdown which lasted seven months. Iaposd tried almost all of the aposfad dietsapos to no avail in the months and years before, and I could just feel my confidence was at an all-time-low, Gavin added. And on October , a Sunday morning, I said to myself that I need to make a change and that day would be day one. He tackled his eating and sleeping habits first and establishing a structure to his diet. Gavin gave himself a simple plan to start off with get eight hours sleep and have three meals a day at roughly the same time of day.  I set myself a rough target of , daily calories and used apps such as MyFitnessPal to help track what I was eating, Gavin added. Initially I didnapost pay too much attention to my macro-nutrients, but made an effort to ensure I was drinking plenty of water, eating foods with high fibre, vitamins and lower fat counts - particularly saturated fats. This meant I still had treats and snacks to enjoy, but the small changes slowly begin to add up and the , calories I consumed each day began to feel like more and more as the days and weeks went by. Some days it was , calories and other days it was , calories - donapost beat yourself up over going over your allowance every once in a while. Itaposs not about cutting yourself off from food, but rather improving your relationship with food.  The amazing thing about Gavinaposs weight loss was he did not join a gym. He never had great interest in the gym and hadnapost done when he was younger. Personally, I never took to the gym when I was younger and always liked to exercise as a means of engaging in a sport or activity, Gavin said. Gyms can be intimidatingyouaposve never become a member, but Iaposd suggest anybody looking to get active consider it. For me, I found a means to exercise in cycling - which has grown into somewhat of a passion for me over the past  months. Here are more of Gavinaposs aposs top tips on how he did it, from his diet to level of exercise:How did you manage your diet It can be dficult to follow a calorie deficit, when youaposre consuming less calories than youaposre burning your body is being forced to eat into fat reserves to fill that void. I made sure not to overdo it - deliberately eating just , calories per day can be too much and you could risk reverting back to old ways. Having my breakfast and lunches at very similar timeshelped build early eating habits that would set me up for the day. Again to ensure I wasnapost completely flipping my diet completely I used a degree of leniency when it came to dinner time, small changes like portion control and avoiding fatty foods when you have the option can make all the dference. Initially I found myself eating a lot of the same foods I already had, particularly snacks, but doing so meant Iaposd simply be eating less of what I used to rather than eating right. After the first week I began replacing some snack foods with lower calorie snacks, which in turn meant I had more calories to play with for my substantial meals. If I was eating a pack of  calorie crisps, Iaposd replace them with  calorie crisps, swap the Cadbury chocolate bars for lower calorie rice cake bars, treating myself to a zero calorie fizzy drink rather than a full sugar alternative. This meant I still had treats and snacks to enjoy, but the small changes slowly begin to add up and the , calories I consumed each day began to feel like more and more as the days and weeks went by. Some days it was , calories and other days it was , calories - donapost beat yourself up over going over your allowance every once in a while. Itaposs not about cutting yourself off from food, but rather improving your relationship with food.What are your favoured foods for weight loss Iaposve found so many great foods the past  months that I never enjoyed before, and Iaposd be confident in saying my relationship with food has really grown as I became more aware of what I was putting into my body. Hereaposs some of my favoured foods these days: Cous Cous: I sometimes use it as a lighter alternative to rice, itaposs easy to make and is high in carbohydrates and fibre.Rice crispy bars: Excellent for a quick snack, theyaposre a lot better than a bar of chocolate.Lentil curls: A low calorie alternative to many brands of crisps, Iaposve grown to love them.Nuts and seeds: A great snack, good source of protein and fats.Turkey burgers: Lean, high in protein and delicious - no explanation needed.Vegetables: Whatever they are eat plenty of them, theyaposre good for you and should be an essential pillar of your diet. Did you give up takeaways and alcohol Not really. Weaposve always had a aposTakeaway Fridayapos at home so I made sure to allow myself the Friday treat. Although instead of chips in the chinese takeaway some weeks Iaposd get rice or even eat a smaller portion. I initially gave up alcohol until Christmas, but when I did drink I opted for lower calorie light beers or spirits more often than not instead of calorie-dense lagers or stout.Do you need support to lose weight Everybody needs support when undertaking such a big change. Whether that be a personal trainer, or just a family member or close friend, Iaposd recommend you get someone on board to be there for support. In my case, I asked a close friend to act almost like my aposcoachapos to keep me honest. He would get in touch every now and then to see how I was getting on, was there to listenI had problems and cheer me on to my goals. Needless to say that educated professionals are much more qualied to play such a role, but having someone to bounce off and hold you accountable on the journey is essential.Did you almost give up Yeah, I came pretty close on November . I was making good progress in the weeks before but that morning I weighed in after a particularly tough week and had lost just one pound. In hindsight losing a pound in a week is a good achievement, but that week had been so dficult and the loss was a lot lower than I was expecting. I was agitated and questioning what I was doing for hours before I was convinced to take an hour to go on a short cycle to clear my mind. If I hadnapost walked out to get some headspace I wouldaposve broken and dialled back weeks of progress, especially since Iaposd already been fully committed to nearly a month. If youaposre about to give in - take a step back and remember why youaposre doing it.What do you doyou lose motivation Some days you just wake up and the same motivation you initially had just isnapost there - itaposll happen to everybody. Of course motivation is great, but it comes and goes. Behind the motivation you do need to have a certain amount of discipline. It can be very tough but you need discipline for when the inspiration and motivation just isnapost there. Weekly goals can help keep you focused.When did you start to see results The real goal wasnapost to get down to a certain weight or number, it was to feel good and take back some confidence that Iaposd probably lost. I started to notice a dference in how I looked around Christmas time , but had already felt better after about  days or so. I tipped the scales initially every week but increased that to twice weekly to avoid any discouraging fluctuations. Weighing yourself can be a good way of mapping out progress, but itaposs not the most important. If youaposre not getting the expected results one week, donapost get discouraged, itaposs important to make sure to keep doing the right things - the results will come.How important was exercise to your weight loss Quite important. I found a passion in cycling during my weight loss journey, but any form of exercise can give you similar results. Some people like running, walking, playing certain sports or of course the gym. It really doesnapost matter what your form of exercise is,you have a healthy and balanced diet then exercise is your best friend. Think of it as a complimentary relationship, the old saying of you cant out-exercise a bad diet can also be true for having a healthy diet but sitting on the couch all day. As little as a walk in the park, a short hike, leisurely bike ride or a dip in the sea can compliment whatever calories deficits youaposre creating and help you reach your goals faster. Butyou are taking on more rigorous exercise, itaposs important to ensure you arenapost creating too large of a deficit and are re-fuelling adequately.What are your golden rules for weight loss Everyone has their golden rules for weight loss, and although these particularly rules wonapost work for everyone, hereaposs a couple of mine: - Calorie deficit: If you create a daily calorie deficit, you will lose weight. Itaposs simple when you break it down like that. - Always treat yourself: Itaposs not about burning your bridges with certain foods, itaposs about improving your relationship with food. - Take your time: Thereaposs no rush, everyoneaposs bodies are dferent and once youaposre moving in the right direction thataposs all that matters. - Find your support network: Find someone to keep you on the right path and hold you accountable in the long run. - Exercise: Doesnapost matter what it is, get out there and get active. - Listen to your body: If youaposre hungry, eat something. If youaposre over-exercising, rest.Whataposs your advice to someone hoping to start their own journey If you were to take one thing from reading this, it would be my real golden rule. Sustainability. Whatever habits, calorie deficits or exercise regimes youaposre trying to put in place - you have to ask yourselfitaposs sustainable. When I set out to lose some weight, the one huge dference between all my failed attempts in the past was I asked myself is it sustainable  You should be trying to implementing a lestyle, not a aposlose weight quickapos hack. When you start on day one, ask yourself could you see yourself doing the same on day  or day   Because to lose weight and live a healthy and well balanced lestyle, whatever way you go about it needs be sustainable in the long term.

Claire Sidebottom was grabbed by her handbag strap and forcibly pulled into a safety barrier at the Manchester city centre club, as she filmed the bouncers and was threatening to report them as they laughed at her. Miss Sidebottom, who was on a pub crawl, dropped the phone before hearing one of the doormen shout: “Grab it and run”. She never saw the £ device again. In a statement to police, Miss Sidebottom said the theft meant she lost sentimental photographs and was unable to be contacted by the hospital who were treating her poorly young son. She also said she had lost faith in door staff and did not want to go out in Manchester City centre again. Police who investigated the robbery found one of the doormen in possession of two kubotans - a weapon used in Martial Arts to place targeted force into pressure points on the body. He has since resigned from his job on the doors of Bar Rogue, in Piccadilly Gardens.  At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Christopher Cash, , from Edgeley, Stockport, admitted robbery, common assault and possession of an offensive weapon and was ordered to pay Miss Sidebottom £, compensation. The other doorman died unexpectedly before he could be charged. After the case full time mother Miss Sidebottom from Mossley said: aposaposI’m glad this manaposs been punished even though I don’t think what he got enough. He was a doorman and he was there to protect people not to bully, assault and rob. aposaposIt has been my first bar crawl for a while and I felt targeted and bullied and felt hurt because people were laughing with him. That evening I only went out to take my mind off what was going on around me at the time. aposaposI can’t even go out around town anymore now without feeling another bouncer will hurt me. This man took my phone that had sentimental pictures of my baby that I can never get back. He took memories away from me.aposapos The incident occurred on February  last year five weeks before the UK lockdown. Andrew Evans, prosecuting, said: aposaposThe defendant was a doorman at the time and Miss Sidebottom was on a night out and was queuing to get in. She encountered Mr Cash and his colleague but she recalls she was refused entry because staff said that she was too drunk and a dispute arose. aposaposDuring that time, she recalls them saying she was too ugly to be let in so she decided to record their behaviour on her mobile phone, asked for their names and threatened to send the footage to head office. aposaposShe then recalls one of the doormen grabbing her phone from her hand but she was able to grab it back. She asked them why they thought they could take this but then recalls one of the males coming at her through the barrier, causing her to drop the phone. aposaposShe recalled falling to the ground and the doorman saying ‘grab it and run’ to someone nearby. He looked up to see someone dressed in black running away and she never saw the phone again. CCTV shows Cash trying to grab the phone by reaching over the barrier, he then grabs hold of her bag and there is a physical confrontation. aposaposThe bag is around her neck and she was forced forward a few steps into the metal barrier. She fights back and gets back her mobile phone. But the other doorman then parts the barrier, steps towards the complainant and grabs the phone causing her to drop it. aposaposMr Cash picks it up and quickly moves out of the way and goes back inside the bar. During this period Mr Cash walks directly towards a hooded person who had been hanging around up the street. He hands the phone to him and the hooded man runs off across Piccadilly Gardens.aposapos Cash said he assaulted Miss Sidebottom when he lunged through the barrier dragging her forward by pulling the bag around her neck. He then stole her phone which had been dropped on the floor and handed it to an unknown hooded man. Officers recovered one kubotan from Cashaposs jacket pocket following his arrest and seized another when they searched his bag in the police station. In mitigation for Cash, who now works as a delivery driver, defence counsel Anna Chestnutt said: “He is a conscientious gentleman who does feel bad as to what happened to Miss Sidebottom. He says she did not deserve to be assaulted and the phone should not have been taken. He understands she deserves to be compensated. “He resigned from his role as a doorman as he felt that was a good thing to do to prevent this from happening again.aposapos Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Daniel Prowse told Cash: “You were working with a colleague when Miss Sidebottom was refused entry to the bar as she was told she was too drunk. She recalls being told she was too ugly to be let in. “She recorded the behaviour of you and your colleague on her phone asking for your names and threatening to send the footage to head office. It would seem it was that which prompted the offending that followed. She recalls one of the doormen grabbing the phone from her hand and another coming through the barrier, which caused her to drop her phone. aposaposYou were the one who first came towards her and pulled her. You took the phone from the floor and you handed it to someone who left with it. It seems to me the purpose was to deprive her of evidence of your behaviour. You abused your power as a door supervisor in relation to her.” Cash was also ordered to complete a -month community order,  hours unpaid work and  rehabilitation requirement days.

Izabella Toole was born at just  weeks at Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital weighing just . lbs. The tot initially appeared well but soon began having breathing dficulties and spent the first few days of her le in intensive care. Parents Eleanor and James, of Liverpool, Merseyside, were shell-shocked when doctors then gave them the devastating news that their baby needed open heart surgery. This was due to a condition called ventricular septal defectwhich meant Izabella had a hole in the wall separating her two heart valves.Eleanor, , told the Liverpool Echo : The size of the hole meant it wasnapost going to sort itself out.  We were told she needed the operation before she was two and we decided we wanted her to have it sooner rather than later. The whole thing was terrying. It was a whirlwind. You just have to trust the experts that youaposre in safe hands. We were shell-shocked. At the time I donapost think you can really grasp how dficult it is to go through that as a family. At six months old, Izabella underwent the gruelling surgery at Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital. On January , the family celebrated the  year anniversary of the operation that saved their daughteraposs le. James, , said: You talk about it, you cry we came out the other end as a family.  It was terrying and obviously a traumatic thing to let your child go through but we knew it was for the best. The family are still processing the trauma of Izabellaaposs early health issues and want to raise awareness of the importance of research into heart defects that made the operation possible. James described their now ten-year-old daughter as wonderful, laid back and happy with dreams of becoming a make-up artist. The couple praised the incredible care and regular check ups they received from Alder Hey. Eleanor said: All the staff were really supportive. They have us a support team that looked after us too and made sure we were okay. During her treatment, Izabellaaposs parents gave consent for their daughter to take part in research projects to further understand heart conditions. They raised more than £ for the British Hearth Foundation in  and now feel it is important to give back to the research that helped their daughter. Eleanor added: It was research that made Izabellaaposs operation possible. Without the people that went before Izabella, all those years and open heart surgery and research, Izabella wouldnapost be where she is.

The obsessed lurker also went into her tattoo shop, called One by One, and made lewd sexual comments. His cruel campaign stopped for five years, but he ed in  and carried on gorping at her through the window until she called the police. He was banned from contacting Green, who models under the name Arabella Drummond, for the rest of his le in October  under the terms of a restraining order. But Westminster Magistrates Court heard he breached the ban for a third and fourth time when he walked past her shop on Berwick Street on  July and  July last year. The paranoid schizophrenic was also in breach of a suspended sentence imposed for breaching the restraining order. In addition, he performed a sex act in front of another woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, on a bus in East London, on  July last year. El-Habachi, of Forest Gate, east London, later told police he was just aposdoing something with my trousersapos despite being caught in the act on CCTV. He also stole cans of Red Bull from a Greggs store on  July last year. He admitted exposure, theft, one count of breaching a restraining order and breaching a suspended sentence at previous first appearances before a magistrates court. The defendant admitted a second count of breaching a restraining order on the first day of his trial in November last year. His  week jail term was suspended for a year and a half and he was told to carry out  rehabilitation days and live under an pm- am curfew for  days. He must also pay £ compensation to the exposure victim and £ in court costs. An application by prosecutors to make him abide by a Sexual Harm Prevention Order was thrown out. Ms Green said she wants to have a baby with her partner, but has so far been put off trying for one because she is worried about the effect more encounters with her stalker will have on the child. She added: Thisincident has made me feel extremely devastated that this has started all over again. I have had to deal with this man for so many years and I fear coming to work or going to lunch. This situation is affecting my relationship with my partner and there are days when I want to leave the country. There have been days of crying and worrying. I am tired of losing my le over this male and I just want this to end. I feel constantly in danger. Luke Staton, prosecuting, said: At around  am on  July last year a woman boarded a bus and around two stops later the defendant boarded the bus and sat to the right of her in the back row. She could see out of the corner of her eye that there were some movements coming from the defendant. When she looked towards him, she could see him he was masturbating with one hand while he looked at her and aposside-eyedapos her. The victim went to the driver to explain what happened and while she was doing that the defendant got off the bus. She asked the driver to report the incident and the defendant was caught on CCTV and identied. When interviewed by police the defendant made no comment other than to say aposI was not masturbating, I was just doing something with my trousers.apos On  July last year, in breach of a restraining order imposed on  October , the defendant was seen on Berwick Street by a member of staff who works with Ms Green. There was no communication at all between the defendant and the victim. He walked past the store and glanced towards it for around two seconds. On  July last year the defendant was seen by the victimaposs manager walking past the store briefly and looking in the direction of the store before walking on. The reason the restraining order was imposed was because he was walking past the store several times every day in the past. Mohammed Naqvi, in mitigation, said: The defendant has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and is close to being diagnosed with autism. He used to live with his elderly mother who is ill but since September he has been living in supported accommodation. He is now receiving much better, intensive, daily support. He has also been offered treatment at a stalking clinic which would help him. Prison would have a detrimental effect on his mental health which could deteriorate drastically as prison would be quite frightening for him. He could lose his place in supported accommodationhe were to be sent to prison today. He can undertake rehabilitation days as part of a community order. The court can follow the probation report and spare him prison today. In regards to the breaches of the restraining order, he has walked past, there has not been any interaction and on one occasion the victim had to be notied about. District Judge Neeta Minhas told him: You cannot commit any further offences or breach any orders. If you do anything like that you will go to prison. I am not sure how many more chances can be given to you. The reason I have not sent you to prison is because you are in supported housing. You will lose thatyou go to prison. You would be in a worse positionyou were to lose that, and society would be put at greater riskyou lose your housing. You have run out of chances this is probably your last. If you breach the order or offend again, not even your personal circumstances will be able to keep you out of prison.

The -year-old said staff at his holiday destination assisted him, while Birmingham Airport staff did not. When he left the plane on his , flight attendants told him nobody was available to help, he claims. With no airbridge between plane and terminal, Dr Malliett was then forced to hop down the stairs from the plane to the tarmac.  To compound matters, he said he then had to stand on one foot during the bus journey to the terminal building. No one at all assisted me at BHX except a young lad at border control who got me through quickly, Dr Mallett., from Stafford in the West Midlands, said. Ryanair has never got back to me and BHX have not been very helpful, to say the least. I have been in plaster for three weeks now.  Hopping down the stairs is likely to have not helped as it was later confirmed I have a ruptured Achilles. Since the ordeal, Dr Mallett, who is supposed to be flying from Birmingham again next month, has been tweeting both the airline and airport asking for answers. He said he is now apprehensive to fly from the airporthe still requires help.  In one tweet he wrote: Pretty crap last week I must say. No help for me walking down the plane steps and then standing on a bus after asking for assistance. I wonderthat is what ruptured my Achilles  In another, he added: Six days now with no answers. Not sure Birmingham Airport is the place to fly fromyou are disabled, never mindyou are brave enough to rough it with Ryanair.

The pictures were snapped during a secret photoshoot at Kew Gardens last November by famous fashion photographer Paolo Roversi, whose previous work has graced the pages of Vogue and Vanity Fair. And Mr Roversi has opened up on exactly how he came to work with Kate and how he also snapped some special photos that are likely to remain private... First meeting The first meeting between Kate and Mr Roversi came last November at Kensington Palace, where the photographer says they met for tea and biscuits.And during this meeting, he says he found Kate a little nervous about carrying out the shoot.He told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera : “At first the Duchess was apprehensive. She is machine-gunned by photographers every day but is not used to posing.“Knowing my photos with models she was a little fearful of facing a real session, which required about four hours of work. But I reassured her that once we started it was going to be very easy. Dresses and jewellery Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.In the portraits, Kate wears three absolutely stunning dresses created by a designer who sheaposs worked with numerous times in the past - Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen.Sarahaposs relationship with Kate goes back more than  years as she also created her iconic wedding gown. And it appears her trust in her is steadfast as itaposs been reported Kate allowed Sarah to pick the dresses for the shoot. For the official portrait , Kate wears a stunning light organza dress, which Mr Roversi says makes the duchess look like a classical ballerina.In terms of jewellery, Kate wears her eye-catching engagement ring and in two of the shots, opts for a pair of diamond earrings on loan from the Queen.While in the photo where she wears the red dress, she wears diamond and pearl drop earrings that once belonged to her late mother-in-law Princess Diana.Hair and make-up  When it came to Kateaposs hair and make-up, the photographer was keen for a less is more approach, with a no defined hair style and little make-up. He told the Italian publication: “I didnapost want her to look too Lady Duchess, too establishment, but as pure and contemporary as possible. Or even timeless.” On the shoot  While taking her picture, Mr Roversi said he was moved by Kateaposs warm and friendly welcome and enchanted by her shining eyes that reflected the loveliness of her soul and her smile showing the generosity of her heart. He added: It was a profound and rich experience for me, an unforgettable moment. I have met a wonderful person, a person who, with her positive energy, can bring hope to the whole world. The photographer also revealed that for some of the images he took, he persuaded Kate to dance and twirl across the floor - something sheaposs rarely done in public. He said: In the end I wanted to take some moving pictures, so with that wonderful wide skirt I made her dance in front of my lens, a sort of accelerated waltz mixed with a pinch of rock aposnapos roll. But unfortunately, he says these dancing images are likely to remain private and have not been released. Selecting the images After the shoot, the photographer was left with a set of around  pictures, which he whittled down to .He says he and Kate then worked together to choose the three final portraits. The Italian newspaper suggests that Prince William and their childrenaposs favourite shot is the one where she looks directly into the camera.The photos, part of the National Portrait Gallery’s Coming Home exhibition, will go on display in Berkshire, where Kate grew up, St Andrews, where she met Prince William, and Anglesey, their first marital home.And yesterday, Kate thanked her many well-wishers on Twitter, in a rare personal tweet. She said: Thank you for all of your very kind birthday wishes, and to Paolo and the National Portrait Gallery for these three special portraits. C.

When she woke up the next day from a nap, she was terried to discover she was unable to move or speak properly and was rushed to AE, Manchester Evening News reports.The professional singer, who has been forced to cancel all of her gigs until February, was left stunned when doctors told her she had suffered a stroke caused by stretching her neck.Helen from Blackpool told the MEN: As soon as I woke up, this pain in my ear started - it was this loud, tingling, wooshing sound, like tinnitus.

Every time I moved, I was swerving - theyaposve since told me I was experiencing vertigo - and I was getting this really harsh pain in my ear like a rattling sound. I could move my left arm fine but the right one was uncontrollably swaying everywhere, and I was being violently sick for about three hours.

My partner is a multi-instrumentalist so heaposs been playing music for me every day and I try to sing along and I can see a little improvement butI do just one song, Iaposm tired - it takes it out of me. Iaposm worried about when, or , Iaposll get back to work. The doctors didnapost speak much about my singing voice, they were more bothered about my speech and my walking.

As a friend behind the camera calls Mary’s name, Mila is seen quickly heading over to her owner and nudging her knee with her nose until she gets her attention. When Mary asks her what she wants, waggy-tailed Mila shows Mary who is calling her by going back over to her friend and giving their knee a firm nudge.  The talented Lab is a hearing dog, a type of assistance dog trained to alert people who are deaf or hard of hearing to sounds around them.Mila also alerts her owner to fire alarms, emergency sirens, her keys dropping, and “much more”, Mary says, who told adoring Mila fans on TikTok that she’s “so proud” of Mila and that having an assistance dog is “le changing”.Over , people follow Mary and Mila’s uplting TikTok account that shows what it’s like to have a hearing dog, and Mila’s newest trick has been viewed more than five million times on the social media . Impressed dog lovers were quick to praise the Lab’s latest work. “She’s so smart!” one person said over Mila’s name call alert. “I’ve never seen this task before!” another commented. “This is so cool.” Mila isn’t the only dog who has been melting hearts on TikTok lately by showing the incredible ways assistance dogs help their owners each day.This German Shepherd stunned viewersafter a video posted by@official_call_me_blueshowed the well-behaved pup helping to do her US veteran owner’s shopping in a busy supermarket.Dog lovers were left amazed by service dog C.C’s ability to fetch items for her owner off the supermarket shelves, even picking out his favourite brand of coffee with ease.

The maximum number of people allowed to meet up indoors or outdoors is set now at six and Covid passports have to be shown to get inside all establishments as a mandatory measure. And the responsibility to inspect these, either on paper or digital, remains with the owners. The Canary government has raised the alert after looking at all the health data and the increasing pressure on hospital beds.  The increased measures will remain in force until at least January  when they will be reviewed again. In most places, capacity levels will be cut to  per cent outdoors and  per cent inside to avoid crowds. Only six people can sit in groups, unless they are living in the same households. Pubs and restaurants will now have to close at midnight and public transport capacity is  per cent.

Take care of her for me.” Kevin and Joe’s owner admitted that they were “bawling” making the video, and urged people in their comments to “cherish every single day with your fur baby.”  Thousands of TikTok users were moved by the emotional video, with owners sharing their tragic experiences of losing their own beloved dogs. “I know how much you miss him,” one person commented. “My Maxy, same story and a chocolate [Labrador]. I can think of him now without crying, sometimes.”“Our animals ’ hearts can go on living longer than their bodies,” another said. “I miss all mine watching over me.”Others acknowledged the bittersweet experience of getting a new puppy after losing a dog. “This made me cry so hard,” a third person admitted. “I’m in this same boat. Just got a new baby after losing my previous one back in June.” “We lost our boy in March to lymphoma,” another added. “And he just sent us a new boy who needs extra TLC.” Kevin and Joe aren’t the only dogs who have left TikTok viewers in tears lately. More than three million people were moved by an uplting video of Rottweiler Pluto, which showed how it might look to have your dog greet you in the afterle. Captioned: “You arrive in heaven, this is how your best friend greets you,” the emotional clip shows Pluto bounding through a field towards the camera in slow motion, a happy grin on his face. “I instantly started sobbing watching this and thinking about that day,” one person commented on the tear-jerking video. “Tears in my eyes - I really hope this is true,” another added.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"district news january 7 2022","story":"Tiny Glenbarr Primary School, which has just six pupils, has just missed out on being named Scotland#s most scenic school.More than , votes were cast in a Twitter contest organised by Henry Hepburn, news editor at education resource magazine and website Tes Scotland, to highlight the stunning locations of Scotland#s schools.The competition attracted  schools and celebrities even got involved, re-Tweeting posts to boost votes during the few days of competition in December.Despite having so few students, Glenbarr reached the nail-biting semi-final, just short of the final.With views overlooking Ben Nevis, Lochaber High School won in the end, narrowly beating Morgan Academy in Dundee.MID ARGYLLVolunteers are needed to help provide and expand PCR testing in several locations across the NHS Highland region, including Tarbert and Lochgilphead.Volunteers will be co-ordinated by the British Red Cross.

This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet. There were no incidents of breach of the peace, assaults and so on.All was peaceful on Islay too.No public houses or hotel bars were open to the public on New Year#s Day, which undoubtedly helped to keep everything quiet.There was one New Year#s Day incident. A van belonging to the Redfusion television company struck a wall on Low Askomill. Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

This original fragment is now in the National Museum of Scotland but its discovery suggested something very signicant about Aberlady’s early history.The design on the fragment was similar to the artwork of the Lindisfarne Gospels, an illuminated manuscript made on Holy Island and completed around AD. This Gospel book is a priceless national treasure, probably created by Eadfrith, the Bishop of Lindisfarne.Ian has a passion for history, especially early Medieval history in the time before Scotland, and so the cross fragment had always fascinated him. The dimensions of the cross fragment suggested that, before it was broken, it would have stood about five metres tall.“A large cross with this level of ornate carving would only be commissioned and erected at a place of some importance,” he told me.“The Celtic Church was widening and deepening its influence and its leaders now had the ear of kings. Royal endowments of land and wealth to the Church and rewards to loyal and battle-hardened thanes co-existed. This was very much a time of devout holy men and warlords. It was such an exciting piece of evidence of Aberlady’s early history.”Ian explained that a cross of similar date and style at Abercorn in West Lothian was very probably carved by the same person, or team of masons, and gave an idea of what the rest of the cross at Aberlady might have looked like. Intriguingly, there were three fragments of that cross.When he told me this, my thoughts wandered for a moment. Here we were, having a wee drink in a pub, talking about a craftsman, or group of craftsmen, whose skill and creativity has been preserved for well over a thousand years, and yet we know nothing about them, not even their names. I raised a glass to them and the countless thousands of skilled stonemasons, joiners, builders and artists of all kinds who really did build our historic monuments, but whom history almost never credits.But, I thought, at least we know who made the beautul recreation: Barry Grove, who also carved the reconstruction of the Pictish cross-slab at Hilton of Cadboll – and he used the same simple tools and techniques that would have been used by those earlier stone masons. The cross was unveiled in Aberlady’s Memorial Garden on December , .Ian then told me of the lost ecclesiastical settlement of Pefferham. He explained that there was a medieval document called Historia Regum, meaning History of the Kings. It was written in the th century and is usually credited to Symeon of Durham. This document listed all the main churches of existence in the Northumbrian diocese of St Cuthbert during the ninth and th centuries AD. Aberlady would have been part of this diocese.“Each of the important churches of the diocese, including Melrose, Abercorn, Edinburgh, Auldhame and Tyninghame, are identied in a clockwise direction in the Historia Regum,” Ian explained. “But there is one church mentioned in that document that is lost in time and seems to have vanished from both maps and memories. It was known as Pefferham, seemingly east of Edinburgh and west of Auldhame.”The western branch of the Peffer Burn flows into Aberlady, of course, and place-name evidence places the village on a route taken by monks travelling between the two great seats of learning of the Celtic Church at this time: Iona and Lindisfarne on Holy Island.This route became a holy highway connecting the two major religious sites, and one very likely taken by St Aidan, who left Iona to establish the church on Lindisfarne. In this context, a high cross here at Aberlady, or Pefferhamyou prefer, becomes quite plausible.More evidence emerged from metal finds in the Glebe Field immediately north of the present church. The tip of an ornately carved bishop’s crosier and a carved representation of Madonna and child had been found by metal detectorists lots of coins too. Moreover, geophysical research located two seemingly overlapping oblong structures, which could have been Anglo-Saxon but perhaps over large when compared with others. The evidence was cumulating and convinced Ian of the need for archaeological research. Historic Environment Scotland agreed and Historical Monument Consent was given, and a case for funding was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund.The project envisaged involving six local schools, as well as many local and not-so-local volunteers, and the funding was approved. The archaeological investigation in the Glebe Field, just north of the church, took place in .The results of the dig were astounding, revealing a signicant settlement of stone structures overlaying earlier timber structures dating to the seventh to th centuries. The largest collection of scattered metal objects dating from the Anglo-Saxon period ever discovered in Scotland came from the Glebe here, pointing firmly to a major settlement during that time.Ian happily told me that “prominent academic research experts have agreed that there is now sufficient artefactual, place-name and textual evidence to say that we can begin to tell the story of the ‘lost’ Anglo-Saxon settlement of Pefferham”. “In fact,” he added, “it seems that base hole for the original carved cross may have been discovered.”It was so fascinating to hear and there is not enough space here to go into all the details of the story, but fascinating leaflets have been produced by the conservation and history society which bring these exciting discoveries to le. But nothing compares to a visit to the village to view the locations and feel the presence of all this history, with brilliantly illustrated information and interpretative  by the society to guide your imagination.What has been achieved by Aberlady Conservation and History Society was summed up by Ruth Parsons, chief executive of Historic Environment Scotland, who has said: “The incredible work done by Aberlady Conservation and History Society has brought previously unknown history to light. It has added to our understanding of a period in history little understood, even by those who know most about it… this fabulous cross reconstruction is, quite simply, unique. Hopefully, it will stand for centuries.”I hope so too."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-new-housing-development-tranent-revealed","story":"Members of the public can learn about Persimmon Homes East Scotland’s plans for land between Lammermoor Terrace and the industrial units off Elphinstone Road on Wednesday.The developer is yet to reveal how many new homes or what size the properties would be on the site, which is currently farmland.A spokesperson for Persimmon Homes East Scotland said: “Persimmon Homes will host an online interactive consultation event on Thursday, January , between pm and pm.“Members of the public are invited to post questions on the proposals and a member of our team will be online to answer.”A formal application would need to be submitted to East Lothian Council following the public consultation.Members of the public would be given another chance to look at the plans and make any comment before they are potentially scrutinised by the council’s planning committee.Mike Falconer, chairman of Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council, encouraged any interested parties to attend the virtual consultation and find out more about the proposals.

How, then, did it go for Raworth Before we could find out, politics show watchers began the day, as is traditional, with Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday. Having started his run last May as a maternity cover for Sophy Ridge, Phillips was the future once . Now he is the longest serving presenter in post.His first interview of  was with Nadhim Zahawi, former Vaccines Minister now Education Secretary for England and, for this day only, Minister for the Sunday shows.Mr Zahawi had already set the direction of the day with a Sunday Times interview in which he said it would be “helpful”the quarantine period could be cut from seven days to five.He also, according to the report, said free lateral flow tests were on the way out. In front of the cameras, though, he said that was not the case. Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had already called the move to scrap free tests “utterly wrongheaded”.: Warning on free testsPhillips’s running order also included João Vale de Almeida, the EU’s ambassador to the UK, on Northern Ireland and trade the First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, on dferences in Covid restrictions around the UK and Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol, on the Colston statue verdict. It was a newsy mix that made for a lively hour.Sunday Morning had Mr Zahawi and Rachel Reeves, Shadow Chancellor, as well as an interview with a hospital chief executive. In keeping with Marr show tradition there was an arts segment, this one featuring Elizabeth McGovern, aka Cora Crawley of Downton Abbey fame, and her new play about fellow actor, Ava Gardner. The show’s other regular, the newspaper review, had also survived intact, as had the set.Sunday Morning was similar to Marr while at the same time very dferent. Where Marr’s show was fleet of foot and proactive, Sunday Morning had the air of a programme that was put together last Tuesday and not changed since. Where Marr set out to make headlines, Sunday Morning came across asit wanted to have no impact at all.In short, Sunday Morning, like its title, felt safe, bland, BBC.Fair enough, butthe Raworth shows prove popular with audiences, and BBC management, it could influence the selection of the new host.Comparing Marr and Sunday Morning has little to do with the presenters personally. Both are experienced, highly respected journalists. But broadly speaking they represent dferent styles and approaches to the jobRaworth, for example, is BBC through and through, cool, calm, hard to read. In recent years it has seemed as though she was getting ready to take on a Dimbleby role with a place at great state occasions.: Covid, the latest figuresMarr, in contrast, with a hinterland in newspapers before joining the BBC, is more of a scrapper whose interview style could best be described as robust. He left the BBC precisely because he wanted to express a view and shake things up.Which style do viewers prefer  It is a question being asked not just at the BBC but throughout the industry as a whole. GB News thought it had the answer by hiring “big personalities”, only to find viewers cared just as much,not more, about basic standards. The signing of Piers Morgan to talkTV shows which way Rupert Murdoch sees the wind blowing.Alternatively, having had a taste of news and views mixing to a greater extent than before, UK audiences could be ready toto the more traditional fare offered by the main channels.Despite the dull title, Sunday Morning might prove to be a lively arrival after all."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13302329.jpg?type=article-full","title":"krazy-kat-ms-marvel-history-american-comics","story":"SOME things never change. To read Jeremy Dauber’s American Comics: A History is to be reminded that the comic book industry in the United States has been racist, sexist and exploitative pretty much from the get-go.And, of course, it was also hugely successful and re-engineered our collective imaginations too.It even changed the way we talk, it seems. “The comic strip’s influence on American language was profound,” Dauber writes of their impact in the early decades of the century. “Bud Fisher of Mutt and Jeff fame invented piker and the phrases fall guy and got his goat. Tad Dorgan came up with applesauce, ball and chain and cat’s pyjamas, among others. Barney Google contributed heebie-jeebies … And Harold T. Webster’s Timid Soul added a whole new character type to the lexicon – or, at least, named it: one Caspar Milquetoast. Comics even gave the world knock-knock jokes…”The distance between influence and reward is one of the recurring themes of Dauber’s new book. The popularity of the pulps – Walter Brown Gibson, creator of The Shadow could afford to live a triplex off New York’s Central Park while churning out  Shadow novels – prompted kids eager to share in the largesse to sign any contract put in front of them, a pattern that was then repeated in comics too.And so, DC editor Vincent Sullivan bought Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster’s original Superman comic strip for  , the equivalent of in today’s money. “And infor that he also got the rights,” Dauber points out. “To Superman.”The equation was simple. You signed away your rights in order to get published. And, as a result, you missed out on the rewards.First appearing in Action Comics in , Superman was an instant success. Very quickly, Action Comicsand the spin-off comic Superman were selling a million copies an issue .In  Siegel and Shuster sued to regain the rights to Superman and recover m they believed they were due for the character. They were unsuccessful. Shuster was later picked up as a vagrant in Central Park. It was only later in the decade that DC began to acknowledge its debt to the pair.Many other comic writers and artistshad similar experiences.But there are other stories to tell. Like the debt comics owe to William Randolph Hearst, the news baron who inspired Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane. Hearst was actually a fan of comic strips. He enjoyed them and enjoyed the copies of his newspaper they helped sell.He hired Rudolph Dirks to create The Katzenjammer Kids which debuted in  and George Herriman, the man behind Krazy Kat, perhaps the greatest comic strip of all time .Indeed, Hearst loved Krazy Kat so much that he gave Herriman total creative control and a letime contract, even though the strip was never hugely popular.Dauber’s book really picks up the pace when it reaches the s and the hysteria that surrounded comics in the post-war conservatism of Eisenhower’s America. Step forward Dr Frederic Wertham, by far the greatest cartoon villain in the story of American comics.Wertham’s back story, as Dauber points out, is intriguing. A German Jew who emigrated to America in the s, he corresponded with Freud, worked with Clarence Darrow defending black defendants and was praised by Thomas Mann and Arthur Miller. His sincerity in wanting to protect kids was not in doubt.But, by the same token, his distaste for comic books, ultimately spelled out in his book Seduction of the Innocent – a prime text for those studying moral panics – at times verged on hysterical. Speaking to a senatorial committee on juvenile delinquency, he suggested, “I think Hitler was a beginner compared to the comic book industry.”The main victim of the attack on comic books was EC Comics, whose horror and crime publications were both sophisticated in their storytelling strategies but also knew the power of a gruesome image.Dauber, professor of Jewish literature and American studies at Columbia University, a spry, humorous storyteller, has fun with all of this. At one point he plays the game of matching Jack Kirby, and Stan Lee – the men behind Marvel comics – with their Beatle equivalents: “Kirby the Lennonesque genius, pugnacious, spiky, out-there imaginative, of a vaguely mystic bent, matched and complemented by Lee’s McCartneyesque, extroverted Organisation Man genius, keeping the verities and structures moving.”Read More: All of the Marvels by Douglas WolkThere is much more here. Dauber covers the s underground comix scene and its political failings , the Watchmen era, continuity exhaustion. He also charts the emergence of female cartoonists such as Phoebe Gloeckner and Julie Doucet, as well as issues of ethnic and religious ersity in mainstream comicsand such st-century creators as Raina Telgemeier , whom, Dauber believes, “is unmatched at dealing with the often unspoken core of children’s literature: defining yourself as an inidual, and understanding the community of adults, one of which you will become.”At the end, Dauber suggests that the story of American comics is “right in the middle of its run.” If so, this is a very readable map of where it has been.American Comics A History by Jeremy Dauber is published by Norton, £."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-dont-consider-launching-national-convention","story":"Scotland’s poor health and high levels of poverty are constantly featured in the mainstream media as an example of Scotland’s inability to manage itself.But there is an irony in this –we are so much better together, why is poverty in Scotland so endemic, and why are our levels of poor health so much worse than in England My own view is that the Westminster Government has little interest in developing a strategic long-term plan to fund and support initiatives to alter the Scottish statistics for poor health and poverty.The latest example of this is the Conservative Government’s refusal for the establishment of safe, clean spaces for Scottish drug users to access help and support.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been universally admired for her cautious and well-informed approach to the handling of the Covid crisis for the last two years.Westminster vetoes and an open border make it dficult for the long-term management of Omicron and whatever virus follows it.The Scottish Government should capitalise on the success of the First Minister’s management of this health and economic crisis by turning its back on the doomed idea of asking for a Section  order. Instead, it should make peace with the Alba Party and call all elected members of all parties to a national convention.We should take a vote on independence andthere is a majority, we should act. We should declare independence by withdrawing from the Treaty of Union or by calling a plebiscite election. If this is legally contested by the UK Government, we can by then have won international support and recognition by the UN and some of our friends and colleagues in Europe. We need to find our courage like some of our famous forebears.Maggie Chetty, Glasgow.  SCOTLAND AND THE EUROPEAN UNIONI REFER to David Leask’s very pessimistic view on the Scottish relationship with the EU .He does not mention the Withdrawal Bill or the Internal Markets Bill, both now passed, which take powers coming from the EU to Scotland and gives them to Westminster.Nor does he mention the high standards on health and safety which came from the EU – for example, in the building, agriculture and water industries.Looking at the water industry, we now see the picture in England, where sewage is repeatedly discharged into rivers because money has not been spent to raise standards to EU levels – as it certainly has been in the publicly owned Scottish water industry.Thames Water was fined over £ million in  and £m in  but now this sanction has gone. I think Scots appreciate that the EU has brought them these high standards, including also on human rights, though they do not understand the details of EU law.They have the SNP President, Mike Russell, and SNP MPs like Alyn Smith and Philippa Whitford as well as SNP MSPs like Christina McKelvie and Jenny Gilruth to keep them informed on the hurdles as well as the benefits of Scotland joining the EU and becoming a normal European country enjoying self-determination at last.Susan Grant, Tain.  SIGNIFICANCE OF WIND POWERLYNDSEY Wardmakes some important points about the current dficulties associated with wind power as a source of renewable energy: the wind doesn’t blow all of the time at times too much wind is blowing so the generators get compensation and there are dficulties with our current grid system.None of this can be denied but your correspondent carefully avoids the other side of the issue.We cannot carry on generating electricity using fossil fuelswe wish to avoid a catastrophe caused by global warming.So your correspondent has, in my view, two options – either deny global warning or offer a solution to the generating issue.In my view, wind generation, imperfect as it is, is a signicant option for the UK and, in particular, Scotland.Undoubtedly, new technologies need to be developed to store unusable power, maybe in the form of hydrogen, but there seems little point in just burying our heads in the sand and doing nothing.So, come on, Lyndsey Ward – unless you are a climate change denier, tell us what are your solutions to the major energy issue of the day – namely, how to phase out fossil fuels.John Palfreyman, Coupar Angus, Perthshire.  THE DAY I LEFT TOM MCKEAN FOR DUSTSUSAN Swarbrick’s very interesting piece about Kelvin Hall in Saturday’s magazine brought warm winds of nostalgia.I have many fond memories of the Hall – getting Henry Cooper’s autograph at the Motor Show, going to see Billy Smart’s circus, and taking my own children to the crisp, shiny new transport museum.Another magical memory which sticks in my mind was being asked to take part in the opening of the Kelvin Hall International Sports Arena.As an amateur wrestler, I was invited to participate in a wrestling exhibition by the illustrious Willie Baxter from Milngavie, who had been the British wrestling team coach at the  Munich Olympics and at the time was a manager in the city’s parks and recreation department.Willie advised me to warm up, so I decided to have a few laps around the brand new  metre running track.At the time, Tom McKean, one of Scotland’s track greats who would go on to win European and World titles, was being interviewed by one of our national broadcasters for a tea-time piece about the new arena.Part of their segment was to film Tom jogging round the track. I couldn’t resist the opportunity – I kicked as hard as I could from about  yards behind Tom and left him for dust, or so it would seem.I tuned in that evening and I must have been even faster than I thought, because I couldn’t even be seen whizzing past the future world champ.If the great man remembers this I hope he can take some consolation. The last I heard, he was a police officer running criminals to ground I, on the other hand, struggle to run a bath.Happy memories.

It doesn’t matter how much Westminster gives Holyrood – it will never be enough.What the Covid crisis shows is how much better Scotland is as part of the Union rather than separated from the world’s fth largest economy, with no central bank, no currency, no national grid, and with a government that wants to shut down North Sea gas and oil.From the rapid and unique development of the Astra Zeneca vaccine, free from the constraints of the European Medical Agency, through the support of the British Army, the roll-out of millions of free lateral flow tests , to the sharing and pooling of medical science across the four nations, the case for the Union speaks for itself.William Loneskie, Lauder.  TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR THE SNPNICOLA Sturgeon’s stance on lateral flow test kits being freely available betrays the core problem with SNP policies: great on the surface, huge problems underneath. Health minister Humza Yousaf is in the same boat .Lateral flow kits are expensive and, like all “free items” on the NHS, prone to abuse. Add in John Swinney’s exhortation to basically use one every time you go out, and not only does the bill rise alarmingly, so does the mountain of plastic waste.Mr Yousaf is not taking into account the damage to commerce nor staff availability nor even the mental health of many Scots.Ms Sturgeon effectively cancelled the holiday period for many and did huge collateral damage to the economy. The SNP is one-dimensional, focussing only on theof time until indyref, but there are three “normal” dimensions plus time and space.The government isn’t coping with the breadth or height of the problems it is facing, and time is running out for the SNP as is space for the endless excuses as to why little is working properly in Scotland today.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.  WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THOSE TEST KITS WHILE fully supporting the ongoing current pandemic injection campaign and the regime for frequent use of lateral flow tests, I cannot help but feel a gnawing and growing unease about the veritable mountain of many millions of single-use pieces of plastic we are creating, destined for landfill, this being anathema to the Greens among us.I also wonderany attempt is being made to reclaim and recycle the tonnes of, presumably high-grade stainless steel, from the teeming multitude of used syringe needles David J O’Hara, Scotstoun, Glasgow.  THE UK MEDIA’S HARMFUL VIEW OF THE EUDAVID Leask’s article on “Scotland’s skin-deep relationship with the EU”highlights some crucial issues, not least the Scots’ affection but lack of detailed knowledge about the signicance of EU membership.That “we are not remotely interested in its detail” is in part true. That Scots “…do not keep up with what is happening in the EU or in its member states…and neither do our politicians” has been deeply concerning, but no surprise.Why might this be  During our tenure as members of the EU, the UK media largely ignored the wide-ranging signicance of our membership, unless an ‘EU bad’ headline was lazily accessible.I was always struck through my involvement with other member states how their national and, more importantly, regional press regularly featured balanced pieces on a new piece of legislation, new consultation, speeches or visits by Commissioners or delegations.By contrast, it was evident that large sections of the UK press indulged in clear campaigns of misinformation which at times verged on the ludicrous. The EU would fairly regularly send measured rebuttals to editors across the UK, but I cannot recall ever seeing these being published.Sometimes the detail doesn’t matter and sometimes it does. Our collective poor record in informing the public did however play a large part in the dreadful and internationally embarrassing decision to withdraw from the EU, the consequences of which we have not even started to realise, as David Leask observes. Our attachment to Europe is perhaps more at an emotional level and sometimes that is more than enough.Tony Fitzpatrick, Dumfries.  A RISK INHERENT IN THE ASSISTED DYING BILLEILEEN McCartinmakes an excellent point about the dangers of the ‘slippery slope’ associated with legalising assisted suicide or euthanasia, as evidenced from the experiences of other countries where laws have been extended to include disabled people, children and those with mental illnesses.She states that many Liberal Democrats oppose Liam McArthur’s proposals but she is incorrect in claiming that “the current Assisted Dying Bill … in no way reflects Lib Dem policy”. Sadly, the Scottish Liberal Democrats did adopt just such a policy in , which was reaffirmed in  by the UK Liberal Democrats in a motion which made specic reference to Mr McArthur’s proposed Bill.Of course, like all previous attempts to legalise assisted suicide, Mr McArthur has failed to address the concerns that exist about how to safeguard those who are vulnerable to pressure being exerted by others with questionable motives, such as access to a potential inheritance or the desire to free up beds in hospitals or care homes.For example, most of those gaining assistance from doctors to commit suicide in Oregon now regularly cite the “fear of being a burden on family, friends or caregivers” as their reason for seeking death.The bill would provide a cheap solution for policy-makers or NHS managers, enabling them to sidestep their obligations to address the unmet need for palliative care. It would make the situation worse.The experience of those countries which have gone down the assisted suicide or euthanasia route shows that the development of palliative care is impeded when such legislation is in place.Faced with shortages of NHS resources, an overstretched workforce due to the pandemic and the prospect of huge savings to be made by enabling patients to end their lives prematurely, can we really trust politicians to come up with a law containing adequate safeguards which will prevent abuses from occurring Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO, Care Not Killing, Glasgow. THE ABORTION CONUNDRUMI HAVE never understood why abortion has not been brought in to the discussion about assisted dying.It is perfectly legal to end a le that has not been lived , whereas people who have lived what they describe as a happy and full le and now wish to end it, either because of, or ahead of, intolerable, unmanageable pain, are unable to make this decision for themselves.Why is it permissible to end one unlived le but not another fully lived le Kathleen Gorrie, Helensburgh. NOT ALL SUFFERING CAN BE RELIEVEDI AM a retired doctor, and a Catholic opposed to assisted dying legislation.Like Lilian McDade , I have watched my -year-old son die. I have witnessed the suffering of patients, of their family and friends, and also within my own family. I don’t believe we can relieve all suffering, either physical or mental.However, I dfer from your previous correspondents. As a doctor, I felt my role was to relieve suffering where I could and to acknowledge and respect the patient and her family when I was unable to provide relief. As a doctor and a person, it was not my role to end her le, only to be present.Some of us have charmed lives and happy deaths, but some have dficult lives and dficult deaths.I believe a caring society acknowledges this and acts to help. Offering death, however, is not acceptable to doctors, nurses or human beings.We ought to oppose assisted dying legislation.Miriam Deeny McKernan, Rutherglen. "},{"url":null,"title":"sru-president-ian-barr-urges-clubs-give-feedback-new-governance-structure","story":"A second consultation paper on the proposals which have been drawn up by the Scottish Rugby Council’s Standing Committee on Governance [SCOG] was issued to clubs on th December, with the initial deadline for feedback being today. However, Barr has promised that clubs which have been slow in getting their thoughts together over the Christmas period will not be excluded from the conversation so long as they reply by the end of next week. The central thrust of the proposals is that the existing SRU Trustand the SRU Councilbe dissolved, with a new parent company to be set up as the ultimate authority in the Scottish game. The Board of this company will be directly elected by member clubs. Below this level, SRUL will continue to run the business, with a Performance Game Board and a Club Game Board looking after those two branches of the game.  It is a complicated issue and Barr recognises that there is a sense of ‘governance fatigue’ after years of squabbling, but he has urged club members to seize this opportunity to reach a settled conclusion which will allow everyone to turn their attention instead towards growing the game. “We need the feedback because what we don’t want is a low number of clubs responding and SCOG pushing on, spending time and resource to create a structure which folk can’t buy into,” he said.  “We have had a couple of challenges, with the escalation in Covid during the last month and a couple of IT issues with the SCOG email in-box, so what we’re saying is that as long as you get your feedback in by the end of next week then we will consider everything that comes to us. “I know a lot of club committees are meeting this week for the first time since the consultation document went out, and they are not too late,” he stressed “We want to collate as much feedback as possible to come up with our final proposal, and at that point we plan to meet with as many clubs as we can through forums and roadshows, to make sure we are absolutely in-line with what clubs want. “We’re looking at an SGM by May at the latest, and to be transitioning in at the AGM in August .” "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

It comes, however, only after millions in public funds have been spent on an ill-conceived vanity project opposed across parties and the communities most directly affected.#No-one disputes the need to modernise air traffic services, which support operations on our leline air routes. Sadly, months and millions have been wasted by SNP Ministers and HIAL on a centralisation that was never going to get off the ground.”Meanwhile, Alistair Carmichael MP said that the “costly and unnecessary” plans have ended “not with a bang but a whimper”, and called for reform of the board of HIAL to ensure the communities that the airport operator serves are heard.“Above all we need to reflect on how this sorry state of affairs came to be in the first place,” said Mr Carmichael.“Retreat on the centralisation plan is only a temporary fix of the underlying problem. HIAL is supposed to be accountable and responsive to the needs of the entire Highlands and Islands and it is clearly not living up to that aspiration.“If we are to avoid another similar fiasco in the future then we need to look at further reform to ensure that our communities are heard on the board of HIAL.”Richard Hardy, Prospect National Secretary, welcomed the announcement and said that the union and HIAL remain in “sensitive negotiations” in relation to the future delivery of air traffic services.A HIAL spokesperson said: “We have been clear that ATMS is the best option to maintain the long-term sustainability of air services for the Highlands and Islands. Nevertheless, we are committed to working with Prospect and our air traffic control colleagues to try and develop a new solution involving compromise by both sides.“We would encourage those with an interest in ensuring the delivery of a safe, resilient, and sustainable air traffic operation for island communities to recognise the delicate nature of these negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue to reach that end.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year. While onboard, Mavis learned to operate every part of the ship, from hoisting and lowering the sails to scrubbing the decks – even learning how to helm and steer the ship.  Brave Mavis also grabbed the chance to climb the ship’s rigging – a height of around .m from the deck.The Jubilee Sailing Trust promotes a unique mission, to give people of mixed abilities and circumstances the freedom to explore their ability, potential and place in the world through inclusive adventures at sea.Alongwith her team – called a “Watch” – Mavis was also in charge of lookout for other vessels or shipping equipment which may affect the course of the ship.There were four Watches over a  hour period, each getting a chance to experience le onboard a tall ship. Watches are made up of people with mixed abilities, mostly first-timers like Mavis, but also those living with a disability.Mavis said: “I went on a voyage on Tenacious and it changed my whole outlook on le. It was the adventure of a letime. I was made to fee part of the team, sailing this magnicent ship, straight away, the permanent crew at our sides – and we couldn’t have done it without them. They guided us in all aspects of the running of the ship with care and kindness.“Watching everyone working together as a team really moved me.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1641394728458.jpg--covid_19___wed_5th_january_figures.jpg?1641394728000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220105newscovid 19 wed 5th january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows three further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby.

The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern.

Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Covid cases across the country have continued to rise with , cases reported from December  to January . Of this, over  were in Derry as Derry remains the county with the highest Covid infection rate in Northern Ireland. Schools across the city resumed face to face teaching in the classroom earlier this week after the Christmas break, with no change to Covid guidance. Susan Parlour, President of National Education UnionNI, said: The message seems to be, keep the schools open and hope for the best, its farcical. There is no PPE in schools and there are no risk assessments. I understand this takes time but it is essential in the current circumstances. Face coverings are required in schools which staff need to provide themselves or they need to accept the substandard masks offered which are really not fit for purpose. Also, many children do not wear their masks and this is rarely challenged. We receive daily figures on Covid cases in schools but with no track and trace in place and lateral flow testing, which has proved time and time again to not be the most reliable, the number of cases and close contacts will be higher than what is recorded. Chief Medical Officer, Dr McBride, stated that Covid was not spreading in schools and that outside socialising was the cause, we saw the rise in cases over Christmas and the schools were shut. Mark Browne, Permanent Secretary, sent a letter to principals on December  that stated that the departments advice onmeasures to reduce transmission has not changed. He stated that EA has provided CO monitors to schools along with detailed instructions on their use. This is not the case. CO monitors are not on the ground and there is little to no guidance on how to use them. NEU NI released a statement providing guidance for CO monitors and their use stating that carbon dioxide monitors are not a solution to the problem of poor ventilation. The Department for Education in Englandis rolling out a very limited number of CO units and most schools will not be able to benefit from this scheme. Susan continued: Schools, students and principals feel let down and there are no mitigations in place to keep them safe. There seems to be a  perception that teachers want to teach from home, it is not the case. Teachers want to be in the classroom but they want it to be safe for both them and their students. There are no measures in place to keep the school community safe, no close contacts, no track and trace, no support and no meaningful guidance. NEU NI are currently advising teachers and schools not to teachover  per cent of their staff are absent. If this number of absent staff members is reached, the school should close. The Education Minister stated that options are available such as consolidating classes or teachers teaching remotely as well as live teaching but Susan explained, this is even more work and pressure on teachers, in an already stressful teaching environment. At St Cecelias College in Derry, % of the staff are currently off sick six teachers and  classroom assistants. There are  pupils who are off sick in one class alone. Tanya Wakeley, teacher and union rep at St CeceliasCollege in Derry, said: We are teaching in a Covid stew, it is a nightmare and it is not good enough. Those are the numbers only two days into the school year and we havent even reached the peak of this Omicron wave. The government has to do something and we need to speak up. We dont want to work from home, its not an efficient way to teach and its double the workload. We want to be in the classroom to teach our pupils, but we want to be doing it safely, where both staff and pupils feel safe. We know for a fact that schools arent safe at the minute and we can see that after only two days back teaching. The students feel let down too, especially the senior years. They dont even knowtheyll be sitting their exams in the summer. Nobody knows what is going on and there is no clear direction. I have students that have never sat an official exam and that will no doubt never get their work experience. We feel very in the dark with everything and we are not being told enough. With teacher absences, many teachers are forced to form compositeclasses or teach larger numbers of pupils than they are used to or is usually advised. Tanya continued: A class can have anything between  to  pupils and what we have to do at the minute, because we dont have enough teachers in school, is put more than one class in the multi-purpose hall. The pupils are all socially distanced, but Covid is airborne, and there are no windows in that hall. If we are in the classroom, the classrooms are freezing because we have to ventilate the rooms, its the middle of January, with the cold air we are going to get sick either way, whether its Covid or not. We are not provided with sufficient PPE, the masks are not fit for purposeand at this stage, it is a complete trust situation that pupils do not come inthey have tested positive or have Covid symptoms. The parents are worried as well and we dont even have the governments guidance to reassure them. We are being told one thing by the government and another thing by experts. You dont know what to believe and God knows what is coming next. This is not going away and its definitely not going away in schools. It is going to get worse before it gets better and we need plans in place. We are collateral damage and we have been forgotten about. Education Minister, Michelle McIlveen, has said her priority remains keeping schools open amid the surge of casesin Northern Ireland. She said there have been no changes to the guidance issued toschools regarding Covid because health officials havent changed their position. Schools experiencing staffing shortages will have the option to move to remote learning and introduce partial timetables, she added. A spokesperson for the Department of Educationsaid that “a range of mitigations” have been recommended to risk the transmission of Covid within schools across the North. They said: “Throughout the pandemic the Department has worked closely with key stakeholders as well as the Department of Health and Public Health Agency as we manage our response and continue to do so. “We continue to follow advice in relation to all public health issues including contact tracing however no changes have been recommended in respect of the approach to contact tracing or changes to the DE Covid guidance. “Rates of Covid infection in the community in Northern Ireland are currently extremely high. Schools are part of our community so it is inevitable that there will be cases among staff and students in our schools. “While we cannot eradicate Covid altogether, a range of mitigations are recommended to reduce the risk of transmission as much as possible in the school environment. “These measures include regular LFD testing, good hand respiratory hygiene, maximising ventilation, face coverings for post-primary pupils and staff and consistent groups wherever possible. “All staff and those aged  and over have also had access to the vaccination programme. We have a shared objective to support our schools so they are able to provide for our children as we all know that the best place for our children and young people is in school. “No one mitigation on its own will prevent the spread of the virus, but used together each mitigation provides works to reduce transmission. “Our schools, like those across the rest of the UK and Ireland, are facing staffing shortages due to the pandemic. There is a limited supply of qualied teachers. “We have made a formal call for retired teachers to provide support and we have also looked to provide more flexibility for schools in how they deploy substitute teachers. If further financial resources are needed by schools we will make bids to meet these costs. “The EA secured more than , C monitors and approximately  per cent of schools in NI have now been provided with monitors, with a further  monitors expected imminently. The additional monitors will be delivered to the remaining schools as a priority and also to those schools that have requested additional monitors. “Good ventilation, along with other measures can help mitigate the risk of transmission. Natural ventilation, such as opening windows can be effective at reducing the risk from virus in the air. “School leaders who are concerned about ventilation in a room should contact the EA maintenance helpline for advice and support on the best approach for their inidual circumstances. “In some cases where an area of poor ventilation has been identied, it may be appropriate to consider the use of an air cleaning unit as an additional mitigation whilst further remedial work is undertaken to improve ventilation. “The pandemic requires a collective response to support the safe operation of our schools – staff, parents, and pupils all have a key role to play carrying out regular testing and making sure making sure that anyone with symptoms follows Covid- advice and information which is available atNIDirect.gov.uk.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Covid cases across the country have continued to rise with , cases reported from December  to January . Of this, over  were in Derry as Derry remains the county with the highest Covid infection rate in Northern Ireland. Schools across the city resumed face to face teaching in the classroom earlier this week after the Christmas break, with no change to Covid guidance. Susan Parlour, President of National Education UnionNI, said: The message seems to be, keep the schools open and hope for the best, its farcical. There is no PPE in schools and there are no risk assessments. I understand this takes time but it is essential in the current circumstances. Face coverings are required in schools which staff need to provide themselves or they need to accept the substandard masks offered which are really not fit for purpose. Also, many children do not wear their masks and this is rarely challenged. We receive daily figures on Covid cases in schools but with no track and trace in place and lateral flow testing, which has proved time and time again to not be the most reliable, the number of cases and close contacts will be higher than what is recorded. Chief Medical Officer, Dr McBride, stated that Covid was not spreading in schools and that outside socialising was the cause, we saw the rise in cases over Christmas and the schools were shut. Mark Browne, Permanent Secretary, sent a letter to principals on December  that stated that the departments advice onmeasures to reduce transmission has not changed. He stated that EA has provided CO monitors to schools along with detailed instructions on their use. This is not the case. CO monitors are not on the ground and there is little to no guidance on how to use them. NEU NI released a statement providing guidance for CO monitors and their use stating that carbon dioxide monitors are not a solution to the problem of poor ventilation. The Department for Education in Englandis rolling out a very limited number of CO units and most schools will not be able to benefit from this scheme. Susan continued: Schools, students and principals feel let down and there are no mitigations in place to keep them safe. There seems to be a  perception that teachers want to teach from home, it is not the case. Teachers want to be in the classroom but they want it to be safe for both them and their students. There are no measures in place to keep the school community safe, no close contacts, no track and trace, no support and no meaningful guidance. NEU NI are currently advising teachers and schools not to teachover  per cent of their staff are absent. If this number of absent staff members is reached, the school should close. The Education Minister stated that options are available such as consolidating classes or teachers teaching remotely as well as live teaching but Susan explained, this is even more work and pressure on teachers, in an already stressful teaching environment. At St Cecelias College in Derry, % of the staff are currently off sick six teachers and  classroom assistants. There are  pupils who are off sick in one class alone. Tanya Wakeley, teacher and union rep at St CeceliasCollege in Derry, said: We are teaching in a Covid stew, it is a nightmare and it is not good enough. Those are the numbers only two days into the school year and we havent even reached the peak of this Omicron wave. The government has to do something and we need to speak up. We dont want to work from home, its not an efficient way to teach and its double the workload. We want to be in the classroom to teach our pupils, but we want to be doing it safely, where both staff and pupils feel safe. We know for a fact that schools arent safe at the minute and we can see that after only two days back teaching. The students feel let down too, especially the senior years. They dont even knowtheyll be sitting their exams in the summer. Nobody knows what is going on and there is no clear direction. I have students that have never sat an official exam and that will no doubt never get their work experience. We feel very in the dark with everything and we are not being told enough. With teacher absences, many teachers are forced to form compositeclasses or teach larger numbers of pupils than they are used to or is usually advised. Tanya continued: A class can have anything between  to  pupils and what we have to do at the minute, because we dont have enough teachers in school, is put more than one class in the multi-purpose hall. The pupils are all socially distanced, but Covid is airborne, and there are no windows in that hall. If we are in the classroom, the classrooms are freezing because we have to ventilate the rooms, its the middle of January, with the cold air we are going to get sick either way, whether its Covid or not. We are not provided with sufficient PPE, the masks are not fit for purposeand at this stage, it is a complete trust situation that pupils do not come inthey have tested positive or have Covid symptoms. The parents are worried as well and we dont even have the governments guidance to reassure them. We are being told one thing by the government and another thing by experts. You dont know what to believe and God knows what is coming next. This is not going away and its definitely not going away in schools. It is going to get worse before it gets better and we need plans in place. We are collateral damage and we have been forgotten about. Education Minister, Michelle McIlveen, has said her priority remains keeping schools open amid the surge of casesin Northern Ireland. She said there have been no changes to the guidance issued toschools regarding Covid because health officials havent changed their position. Schools experiencing staffing shortages will have the option to move to remote learning and introduce partial timetables, she added. A spokesperson for the Department of Educationsaid that “a range of mitigations” have been recommended to risk the transmission of Covid within schools across the North. They said: “Throughout the pandemic the Department has worked closely with key stakeholders as well as the Department of Health and Public Health Agency as we manage our response and continue to do so. “We continue to follow advice in relation to all public health issues including contact tracing however no changes have been recommended in respect of the approach to contact tracing or changes to the DE Covid guidance. “Rates of Covid infection in the community in Northern Ireland are currently extremely high. Schools are part of our community so it is inevitable that there will be cases among staff and students in our schools. “While we cannot eradicate Covid altogether, a range of mitigations are recommended to reduce the risk of transmission as much as possible in the school environment. “These measures include regular LFD testing, good hand respiratory hygiene, maximising ventilation, face coverings for post-primary pupils and staff and consistent groups wherever possible. “All staff and those aged  and over have also had access to the vaccination programme. We have a shared objective to support our schools so they are able to provide for our children as we all know that the best place for our children and young people is in school. “No one mitigation on its own will prevent the spread of the virus, but used together each mitigation provides works to reduce transmission. “Our schools, like those across the rest of the UK and Ireland, are facing staffing shortages due to the pandemic. There is a limited supply of qualied teachers. “We have made a formal call for retired teachers to provide support and we have also looked to provide more flexibility for schools in how they deploy substitute teachers. If further financial resources are needed by schools we will make bids to meet these costs. “The EA secured more than , C monitors and approximately  per cent of schools in NI have now been provided with monitors, with a further  monitors expected imminently. The additional monitors will be delivered to the remaining schools as a priority and also to those schools that have requested additional monitors. “Good ventilation, along with other measures can help mitigate the risk of transmission. Natural ventilation, such as opening windows can be effective at reducing the risk from virus in the air. “School leaders who are concerned about ventilation in a room should contact the EA maintenance helpline for advice and support on the best approach for their inidual circumstances. “In some cases where an area of poor ventilation has been identied, it may be appropriate to consider the use of an air cleaning unit as an additional mitigation whilst further remedial work is undertaken to improve ventilation. “The pandemic requires a collective response to support the safe operation of our schools – staff, parents, and pupils all have a key role to play carrying out regular testing and making sure making sure that anyone with symptoms follows Covid- advice and information which is available atNIDirect.gov.uk.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Hundreds of people turned out for the first day of vaccinations at the Centre, which played an important role in the initial drive to deliver First and Second vaccinations. The Foyle Arena is now open to walk-ins and bookings from am to pm, Monday to Saturday, and am to pm on Sundays. Mayor Warke joined them to receive his booster jab, and said he was impressed by the swt organisation of the effort and the professionalism of staff on site. He said: “This is a rapidly changing situation and I am extremely impressed at how these measures have been so quickly put in place to meet demand. I want to acknowledge the work of the Western Trust staff who are doing such an amazing job in very challenging circumstances. “I also want to thank all the staff at the Foyle Arena, and previously at Templemore, who are playing a vital role in this effort. “The Trust are aiming to vaccinate  people a day at the Foyle and I would appeal to everyone attending to please follow the advice of the professionals and lets do all we can to get as many people as possible protected in the weeks ahead.” The campaign is expected to continue until January and to safely accommodate the numbers of visitors to the centre Members of Foyle Arena, there will be some minor impacts to services over the coming weeks, though most will continue as normal. This includes changes to studio class timetables, and alternative temporary arrangements are now in place for Members, with a wide range of leisure services also available across other Council owned leisure Centres. Director of Health and Community with Council, Karen McFarland added: “There has been a speedy response to the recent developments in the Covid pandemic, and we were happy to be able to step up once again to provide much needed facilities to help progress the Trusts Vaccination Campaign. “Measures have been put in place to mitigate any impacts and while most of our leisure services will continue as normal, there may be some disruption to some activities which we will communicate directly to our members. “This is a short term campaign, and I really appreciate everyones patience as we assist in getting vaccinations to those who need them. “With high volumes of people expected to attend I would appeal to people to please follow the guidance at the centre and the directions of staff – they are there to help keep things running smoothly. “The safety of our staff and the public is our first priority and I would ask for everyones cooperation over the coming weeks.” With the volume of people accessing the Foyle Arena, additional parking is available for members at Clooney Park West playing fields. To find out more about leisure services available across all Council sites, and any changes to timetables please go to: derrystrabaneleisure The Western Trust this week issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. People are being encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Vaccinations are also available from GP surgeries and local pharmacists. Over s who have yet to get their first dose of the vaccination can also receive it at the vaccination centres.

These proposals are being brought forward by a new partnership between Derry-based property developer South Bank Square and housing provider Choice. The new plans include a mix of social and affordable homes ranging from one to four bedrooms, comprising a mix of terrace, detached and semi-detached houses as well as a number of bungalows and apartments aimed at those aged  and over. Proposals also include signicant areas of open space, a woodland walk, allotments, childrens play area, and a tenant hub. The project represents poundmillion of investment to the City Region, and will see the creation of approximately  new jobs over a period of eight to  years. Martin Mallon, Managing Director of South Bank Square said: “We are delighted to unveil these updated proposals for the Ballyoan site. “This new partnership with Choice Housing Association represents a signicant multi-million pound investment in the North West and will see the development of hundreds of new family homes over the next ten years. “The comprehensive planned development of this site will be key to delivering some of the thousands of new family homes that we know are very much needed in the city now and over the forthcoming years. “The new proposals will include expansive areas of open space, children’s play areas, a woodland walk, as well as proposed improvements to the local roads infrastructure. “It is fantastic to be able to announce this level of investment in our home city and we expect that this scale of investment will bring with it many job opportunities for local people and local suppliers in the North West. “Enabling works have already started on site following our planning approvals granted earlier this year and we hope to commence house building on site early in .” Michael McDonnell, CEO at Choice added: “We are thrilled to move forward with these proposals in partnership with South Bank Square. This project will unlock huge potential to create much needed, high quality social and affordable homes for a range of people in the city. “As well as relieving housing stress in the city, this project will allow young families to get on the property ladder by bringing forward a number of affordable homes, as well as offering professionally managed, exceptional private rental opportunities too. “Extensive planning has been carried out to ensure the needs of young families, disabled people, and the elderly are catered for, with plenty of green space, allotments, a play park and a tenant hub included in our ambitious plans. “We hope to be able to secure planning permission for these homes so that we can begin to deliver them as soon as possible.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Invest NI and the Department for the Economy , believe that Northern Ireland’s ranking in the ONS survey is not truly reflective of the level of innovation activity that is actually being delivered across the region. This could be down to the fact that many businesses simply don’t recognise what they do as innovation.  In response to the ONS, DfE launched Innovate NI in October  this is an initiative that supports local businesses to progress through a four-step innovation framework for successful innovation to create value. The initiative also provides official recognition for innovation activity, helping businesses to understand where they are in their innovation journey and recognise their innovation achievement.  As a business further develops their innovative project, they can have their activities assessed by Innovate NI. If deemed to be innovative, they receive recognition so they can clearly see the level of progress that theyre making.  Mary agrees with the need to encourage businesses to identy as innovative.  “One thing is for sure we don’t shout about our innovation achievements enough. I firmly believe the NI economy is much more innovative than the ONS survey portrays during the pandemic, we found that NI actually had a lot of innovative businesses with erse offerings and locally we showed a high level of resilience in dealing with a very signicant economic shock. “But I do think micro-businesses in particular, sometimes struggle to see themselves as being innovative and struggle to understand all the supports that are available to them. That’s why Innovate NI’s recognition scheme is so important and it is one of the reasons we decided to support the work of Innovate NI with the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant.” Economic Recovery Innovation Grant The Economic Recovery Innovation Grantis funded by the Department for the Economy’s Economic Recovery Action Plan. The grant was launched on th November and it provides small-to-medium-sized businesses, including micro- businesseswith the opportunity to apply for a grant of up to pound,.  This grant was created to help businesses progress their innovative idea - this idea must be new to the business, or the market, for example, a new product or service, or a new process within the business. The grant will help a business that is currently working on an innovative project to test and develop it, with the end goal of commercialising the product or service, or implementing the process fully in the business. The pound, can be used to fund development costs and the actual implementation of that innovative idea into the business. Businesses hoping to apply must complete Invest NI’s eligibility checker and satisfy the scheme’s eligibility criteria including being registered with HMRC and being a Northern Ireland-based SME or social enterprise.  They must also have a valid Silver Level Innovator recognition from Innovate NI. Silver Level Innovator recognition means businesses have already started to test and develop an innovative idea for their business.  Businesses can checkthey satisfy the eligibility criteria on Investni andthey do, they can submit an innovation assessment to find out their innovation level. Once issued, Invest NI will invite the eligible, Silver Level Innovator to apply for ERIG. Mary says the reason why businesses must have the Silver Level Innovator recognition to qualy for the grant, is to ensure that the grant is put to good use.  “We want local businesses to further develop innovative projects, services or processes that will enable them to grow. A business that is recognised as Silver Level has already completed the ideation and selection steps of the Innovation Framework, so we know the grant will be used to progress an idea Innovate NI has assessed as potentially innovative. “Using the grant to achieve commercialisation or implementation would then, hopefully, allow a business to progress to Gold Level Innovator status.” Innovate NI also provides help, support and signposting to ensure businesses progress through these innovation levels. This helps to avoid repeating the same step over and over again. This signposting will also help businesses know where to go for the right help. “Innovation can be something big or something minor, but it can make a major change for an SME or micro business. Just go checkyou are eligible and where you are on the Innovation Framework - it could completely change the way you do business.” The closing date to apply for the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant is pm on Monday, st January . Grants will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.   Figures from the Department of Health of positive Covid- cases in the North of Ireland.  “The rates at this moment are just phenomenal. You always worry about older, vulnerable people getting infected – certainly in Derry in the last week, weve seen more than five hundred patients in Derry and Strabane over sixty years old becoming infected. Across Northern Ireland that figure is more than three thousand. “Your worry from that is do those elderly and vulnerable patients end up in hospital  So far, our numbers for hospitalisations have only increased to around ten per cent in the last week or so. But we will be watching it very closely because although the Omicron iant is clearly a milder disease for younger people, we dont know yet how it will affect the elderly. “With Omicron, the factor here is how infectious is it. I think thats the major reason weve seen such a big increase. As throughout the pandemic, every time we think were successful, we become complacent and loosen up and complacency always leads to failure. “There was something about us being too complacent before Christmas in terms of bringing in enough restrictions early enough. That to some extent is the problem with a democracy. Politicians want to react to public sentiment rather than anticipate public sentiment. “You see in China, they closed down a million-person cityafter they get three positive results. WhereasBoris Johnson seems to be quite content to tolerate hundreds of thousands of infections per day because he thinks thats what the public seems to be wanting to tolerate. “Its a strange dichotomy in terms of how democracies respond to these pandemics.” The Health Service has been under considerable strain ever since the pandemic began almost two years ago. And Dr Black warns that the strain both the virus and the extra workloads it has brought upon the medical sector may well affect important services being delivered by the Health Serivice. He continued: “We worry about how the virus will affect iniduals in terms of their own health but also the effect that is happening on the Health Service with respect to the ability of staff to attend work. “The BMA mapping before Christmas suggested ten per cent of staff to be off with illness and a further ten to fteen per cent off due to isolation. Unfortunately, we seem to have been proven to have been correct. “Were seeing signicant numbers of staff missing – not just in general practice but in hospitals with nurses, doctors, paramedics and particularly in the ambulance service as well with response times from ambulances longer than we would want. “I see some of the ambulance services in the north of England were saying thatyou had a heart-attack, dont wait for an ambulance – go directly and get a lt to hospital. “Thats an extraordinary situation that were in that the virus is limiting the services for patients in other areas such as heart-attacks and strokes.” Meanwhile, the Western Trust has said it will continue with the temporary suspension of visitors to patients in hospitals, such as Altnagelvin in Derry. A short statement on the Western Trusts website read: “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation in relation to the recent changes to our visiting arrangements. Your support helps us to provide safer care for your relatives and friends who are currently in hospital. “Due to the continued pressures on our hospitals and the high level of COVID- transmission in the community, visiting remains suspended across our hospital sites and facilities. This does not apply to birthing partners, for maternity arrangements.” The Foyle Arena is serving as a mass vaccination centre. It is open between am to pm except on Friday, January  where it is open until pm. The centre is closed on Saturday, January  and Tuesday, January . Its opening hours on Wednesday, January  are pm to pm. The Shantallow Community Centre will be offering vaccinations on Tuesday, January  between pm to pm.

She argues that the new accommodation for the incoming undergraduates would be of immense benefit to the retail and hospitality sectors of Derrystudents were resident close to the citys heart. The student pound could help to kickstart the local economy – more so given the effects the pandemic has had on Derrys businesses. In the letter, Ms McLaughlin writes: “Our city will benefit substantially from the intake of new students. That benefit will increase even furtherthe new accommodation needed for them is located in or close to the city centre. “More specically,students live between campus and city centre this will have signicant positive impact on the commercial heart of the city, through its retail and hospitality sectors. I need hardly remind you of the hard times they have suffered over the last two years. “It is essential that core institutions such as the university work together with the public and private sectors, in order to maximise the combined impact. “I suggest this would in this instance be best achieve by providing student accommodation where it will have the most economic impact, which would be close of Derrys city centre. “Moreover, this would provide the best student experience by giving students easier access to the benefits of urban le, with close proximity to retail facilities and evening activities.” Explaining why she has taken it upon herself to write to Ulster University, Ms McLaughlin added: “I am urging the Ulster University Vice Chancellor, its Council and Senate to consider the potential benefits of their actions to the wider city. Our retail and hospitality sectors have suffered terribly through the pandemic, and locating new student accommodation close to the city centre would provide a real and much needed boost to our commercial sectors. “This, in turn, would help to safeguard existing jobs, as well as creating new jobs. I hope Ulster University will accept the logic of my argument. “While my party and I have campaigned for years for the expansion of Magee on the basis of the skills that will be created that will benefit the city and so will create well paid jobs, it is also very important that the expansion provides wider economic benefits through higher spending in the city and on local businesses. That, too, will create more jobs.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

People are sick of it.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view. If you’re stopped by police with a heavily cracked windscreen, it could lead to penalty points and a fine.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Hoey, who was the Minister of Sport in Tony Blairs government and now sits in the House of Lords as an Independent peer, wrote a forward in a report released by a fringe Loyalist group. In it she wrote: “I... support the ongoing work to encourage those, especially from working class loyalist communities, to engage in education and to seek entry to professional vocations such as journalism, law, and public service. “There are very justied concerns that many professional vocations have become dominated by those of a nationalist persuasion, and this positioning of activists is then used to exert influence on those in power.” Ms Hoeys comments have drawn widespread criticism across the political board with the exception of DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson who posted on Twitter that he welcomed Hoeys contribution. Susan McKay has refuted Hoeys claims as baseless and thatthere is evidence of Protestants under-achieving in education, then that is for unionism itself to look at and address. She said: “I found it really depressing to see Kate making comments that I would have heard in my own childhood back in the s. “When I was a child, I would have heard adults in the community that I was growing up in saying things like oh the post office is rotten with them – meaning that jobs that were traditionally held by Protestants in the Post Office were now being obtained by Catholics. “The notion that somehow or the other, Catholics getting jobs was something that was disgusting and to be avoided is very obviously sectarian and I think that Kate Hoeys comments, unfortunately, fit that model. “There isnt any evidence whatsoever of any of the things that shes claiming. We do have fair equality legislation. There used to be ways of excluding Catholics by finding out peoples names before youre offered jobs but there isnt any more. “Nor is there any mechanism to exclude Protestants. People have the same educational opportunities and I think the thing is thatthere is evidence of unionist under-achievement in education, then thats a matter that unionism should be looking at and addressing. “Kate Hoeys comments are very much reverting to a sectarian model of society but I think that most people would recoil from this. I dont think thats the way most people see society anymore. “Unfortunately, the worst aspect of it in a way is the fact that Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the DUP, has stepped in and welcomed the both the report and Kate Hoeys comments. “Thats the unfortunate part of it that someone like Jeffrey could have responsibly said, of course we encourage equality in all of the professions and we believe that all of our young people should have the same educational opportunities. “But instead he is supporting this sectarian approach which makes it seem asProtestants arent succeeding because of Catholics. Hoeys citing of the legal and media professions have led to concerns of the former MPs comments could inadvertently paint a target on peoples backs. Journalist, Martin OHagan was killed by Loyalist paramilitaries in Lurgan back in  and in , lawyer Pat Finucane was murdered in his own home by UDA terrorists. Pats son John, now the Sinn Feacutein MP for North Belfast, condemned Hoeys comments and Susan McKay said that Catholics who had scaled the social ladder were often seen as getting ideas above their station. She added: “We know of John Finucanes father, Pat, who was a Catholic lawyer who was murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries. “There has been a lot of evidence over the years of a pattern of sectarian killings during The Troubles of Catholics who had – to use a Northern sectarian phrase – got above themselves. “It used to be a common enough phrase in Northern Ireland when I was growing up. “This notion goes right back to the foundation of the state with Lord Brookeboroughs infamous ninety-nine per cent of them are disloyal comment when he was urging employers to go for Protestants lads and lassies as he called them.” McKay also said that unionists such as Hoey should maybe look instead at how unionism has stunted working-class growth in the Protestant community instead of seeking to place blame on aspirational working-class Catholics who have attained white-collar jobs such as lawyers and journalists. She continued: “My parents would have been working-class Protestants who had been able to avail themselves of the  Education Act. So it lted Protestants as well as Catholics because unionism has never looked after its working-classes. “The whole Orange system was meant to be that you knew your place andyou were working-class, you stayed working-class and you did what you were told by your betters. “It was a very rigid system and it didnt encourage people to aspire to better themselves. In some ways, what were seeing now is a playing-out of that. “There is a passivity still within the Protestant community that doesnt serve young working-class people well.” Hoeys comments and Donaldsons endorsement of them have been regarded as unionism whipping up support from its core voting base ahead of this years Northern Ireland Assembly elections. However, McKay reckons thatthis is part of their strategy, it could backfire on them. She said: “Its a dangerous and irresponsible game to start invoking those old sectarian ghosts. “The Good Friday Agreement was supposed to have moved us on from all of this. This is just an attempt to throw us back to the old days when everything was defined in terms of them and us. “Its just so counter-productive for unionism to talk like this at this time. Its so obvious thatunionism wants to keep the union, they need to make it attractive to Catholics and nationalists as well as to unionists. “But that kind of talk, now being endorsed by Jeffrey Donaldson, is far more likely to turn more young unionist people away from unionism than anything . Youre not going to attract any nationalists because its really insulting to everybodys intelligence to be spoken to in that way. “People may well just feel, roll on the referendum on unity, as we cant go back and this crowd dont seem to want to go forward. I think thats how it will work. It will just make people think,  this is the way unionism is going to talk, then there is no future for this state. “Its like the crocodile moment with Arlene Foster where a lot of nationalist people who were not particularly politicised were politicised by that remark as they recognised it as being really demeaning.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

We’re encouraged to make these ongoing health measures as much a part of the holiday as mulled wine and mince pies. Such steps can help protect our nearest and dearest while we’re together. The gt of protecting one another from COVID- – including the Omicron iant – is the one that truly keeps on giving. The weather outside may be “frightful” but, gathering indoors, we can still open windows to allow fresh air to disperse the virus. Embrace face coverings, there are seasonal styles aplenty to add festive flair to commuting and high street shopping trips. Every adult in the country needs to get a COVID- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk covidvaccination. Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the new Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before because Omicron COVID- is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a COVID- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. And, swter than shaving or applying makeup, taking rapid lateral flow tests are a quick and easy part of your getting ready routine before venturing out. If you have been in contact with someone with COVID- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that dayyou test negative. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for  daysyou are a contact of someone with COVID-. Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-, so keep it on. A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year, celebrate safely and let’s make it a good one. ‘It’s vital to ventilate’  Leeds University Professor of Environmental Engineering Catherine Noakes, pictured, said: “As Christmas is coming people will naturally be spending more time indoors – welcoming friends and family into their home and attending social events together – as the weather gets colder.While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it’s important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home even when people are vaccinated.“In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especiallythere is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air.“That’s why it’s so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, evenjust regularly for a short time. This way fresh air can disperse and blow COVID- particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.”  Wish List  Vaccinations  All adults now need to get a booster vaccine, as two doses do not offer enough protection against the fast spreading Omicron iant. Boosters are available  weeks after second jabs. Get Boosted Now at nhs.uk covidvaccination to signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.

McGuigan did not concede a single goal until Desertmartins Ulster semi final defeat to eventual champions Denn of Cavan, and his kick outs provided ample opportunity for the young side in front of him to get at the opposition. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Thompsons pace and running ability saw him constantly encouraged to drive forward from his corner back position into the Dolans attack. He was particularly strong as his side regrouped in the semi final to overturn Moneymores lead, streaming forward at the encouragement of his team-mates to cause the opposition defence a number of problems. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Monaghan is another of the new breed of corner back who is equally comfortable joining in his sides attacks, along with numerous other defenders. The corner back is more than adept at the less glamorous nature of the position too, tenacious in the tackle, intense in his press and has the controlled aggression required to unsettle opposition attackers. Pic by Seamus McQuillan Mono Pix.  An old-school, sticky corner back, Walker was superb as Moneymore defeated Drum in the quarter final, and kept tabs on Dolans Kevin Nixon for much of the semi final. Walker was strong too in the quarter final win over Drum, producing some fine blocks and interventions to showcase his technical defending ability. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Hitting - in their semi final win over Craigbane, McElhennon has sickened defenders all year from deep. He also netted in their Ulster win over Donagh, and has shown a knack for attacking from deep with the poise and devastation of a heat-seeking missile. A key cog in Desertmartins running machine and a large part of their success this season. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Prone to a solo burst into the opposition half, he was particularly good against Drum, drawing an early save from their goalkeeper. Adept at sitting deep and playing the pivot as the men in front of him probe for a defensive opening, Moran has the game intelligence to know when to join the attack to create the overload and give the best opportunity for a score. Pic by Mary K Burke.  At the other side, Desertmartin had a mirror image of McElhennon in McEldowney, who was able to apply pressure on the opposite flank as St Martins hit teams with their speedy runners. Thrived in the space afforded to Desertmartin in their Ulster win over Donagh, and was a strong presence in their semi final defeat to Denn as well. Pic by Tom Heaney nwpresspics.  With his midfield partner Oran Kelly popping up in attacking positions, McGovern was the organiser, sitting back into the hole and looking for the opportunity to hurt the opposition. A calm head during the  final in June, he helped pave the way for that breakthrough success, using all his experience to see his side through a tough patch.  McGinleys experience and physical presence around the midfield area was a big boost for Dolans as they made their first JFC final since . An experienced head in the middle, he helped orchestrate their come-from-behind semi final win over Moneymore in Ballinascreen, and was a vocal organiser to have at centre field as he drove his team into the final. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  CDP Team of the Year : Hurling  See who has made our Team of the Year for last years hurling season.    Torturer-in-chief of a weary Moneymore defence in the semi final, McCosker hit two points and was named man of the match. His ball-carrying ability was key to that turnaround against Henry Joy McCrackens, not only resulting in his own scores, but yielding a number of frees for corner forward Odhran McKane to convert. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  McGuckin was a key link man in the St Martins side, choosing the correct option consistently and helping to probe opposition defences. Another experienced head to guide the younger players around him, the half forwards relentless movement helped create openings for the men around him, while he chipped in with crucial score of his own. Pic by Mary K Burke.  A threat all season, there was an excitement among the Moneymore side when Crozier received the ball. Comfortable running at defenders, he was a threat throughout their junior championship campaign, and was key in helping his side open up a lead in the semi final before a determined Sean Dolans side reeled them in. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Bloomer hit - against Sean Dolans in the semi final and - in a man of the match display against Drum in the quarter final. Showing a dogged determination to threaten the goal, he turned down marks on two occasions, opting to put the head down and go for the net. Both decisions resulted in a collective - as Bloomer showed a ruthlessness in front of the posts. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Murrays breakthrough season has seen him torment opposition defences with ceaseless energy and clinical finishing. His free-taking has also been a feature, and the precocious forward has been rewarded for a fine debut season at adult level with a call-up to Rory Gallaghers provisional Derry squad for the upcoming McKenna Cup. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Had a slow start in the semi final win over Moneymore, but was clinical in the pressure of the closing stages, finishing the game with four points. His free-taking, while errant in the early stages, was slick and composed when it mattered, with the game in the proverbial melting pot as his side chased down and overturned the Moneymore lead.

The St Oliver Plunketts stopper went through the entire championship campaign without conceding a single goal, and his efficiency from kick outs helped his side to reach back-to-back intermediate finals. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Quinn organised the Greenlough defence that was narrowly beaten in a low-scoring county final, and was a tough competitor throughout. A consistent performer, he was comfortable bringing the ball out from the back and supporting his team-mates in attack. Quinn has a seemingly indefatigable engine, and a willingness to give everything to his teams cause. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Lindsay had a fine season at the back for the county champions, and presided over a defence that was not only organised, but ready to break at pace. Tasked with curbing some of the countys more lively attackers, Lindsay produced a consistent level of performance that laid the foundations for his sides Derry success, as well as the run to the Ulster final that followed. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Flitting between corner back and half back, the versatile Steelstown man was tasked with picking up Enda Lynn in the latter stages of the county final as Neil Forester pushed on, and did a fine job until the Greenlough man was forced off through injury late on. Energetic and determined, Baker has all the attributes required to be a successful defender. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Rafferty was a lively member of the Drumsurn half back line that was the fulcrum of so many of their attacks during the championship. His input was vital in the deciding league victory over Banagher, and the has had a fine season as St Matthews reasserted themselves as a force to be reckoned with during manager Sean Bradys maiden year at the helm. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Concannons pedigree and ability was crucial to Steelstowns run through the county championship and on to an Ulster final. His pace, anticipation and fitness at the heart of the Brian Oacutegs defence have been consistent over the last few seasons as they fought to make the breakthrough, and proved crucial in finally getting them over the line. Pic by Mary K Burke.  A strong runner, Kearney drove Greenlough on as they attempted to win successive intermediate championship titles. Particularly adept at winning turnovers as the opposition ran out of room in the Greenlough half back line, he was a key part of a defence that did not yield a single goal in championship football all year. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Devine was an attacking threat for Brian Oacutegs from midfield, and showed great leadership throughout their championship campaign. His experience shone through in a side that blended the seasoned and the youtful with fantastic results. Devine drove Steelstown on throughout their Ulster campaign, particularly good in their win over Donaghmoyne. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Following the injury to Niall Bradley, McCallion was asked to take on a lot of the heavy lting in the Greenlough midfield and performed admirably throughout the season. A huge presence physically, McCallions ability to win ball, both first and second, was key to his sides dominance of opposition teams during their championship campaign. Pic by Mary K Burke.  CDP Team of the Year : Junior football  Who has made the cut for the junior football final XV     McCarron has shown all his power and skill throughout the championship, not least in the last two Ulster championship games when defences have opened up. No longer an unknown quantity, McCarron has dealt with the expectation that comes with being on the county , and produced consistent quality performances in the blue of Steelstown. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Not a man in Derry would have begrudged Neil Forester the chance to lt the Bateson Sheridan Lee Cup this season. Led by example and had the experience to organise games at key moments. First shackling Enda Lynn in the final, his versatility in pressing on in the final quarter helped spark the final push that delivered delirium in the Maiden City. Pic by Mary K Burke.  His withdrawal in the final was a blow to Greenlough and gave Steelstown the boost they needed to go on and win the game. As prolic as ever during the  season, Lynn was the perfect foil for the electric Niall Loughlin, sharing the scoring burden and proving creator-in-chief for the St Oliver Plunketts side in both their league and championship campaigns. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Pace, trickery and clinical finishing are all in McMonagles locker. He nailed the pressurised free to take the Derry title and has cut loose in the open spaces of the Ulster intermediate series. The corner forward exudes a real joy in playing the game, and has shown a relish for taking on opposition defenders in one-on-one situations, often leaving them in a flap. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Again the focal point of the Plunketts attack, Loughlin destroyed Slaughtmanus with -, hit a further - against Drumsurn and - in the sticky surroundings of the county final. Followed up a fine early season showing with the county side by shooting his side to within a whisker of back-to-back Derry intermediate titles. Once again a serious threat. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Another man to take advantage of Steelstowns free-scoring plan, Murray has used his pace well. Hit a point in the county final. Murray has produced performances of such consistency throughout the season that he finished the year among the championships top scorers, and made hay in the open fields of the Ulster intermediate championship.

Pic by Ramsey Cardy Sportsfile. googletag.cmd.push Brendan Rogers  “Ive barely trained all week,” said Rogers after his - haul in the Ulster semi final win over Dunloy. The Emmets man had risen from his sick bed to down the Cuacutechullains, producing a superb performance in his relatively new role in midfield. A week later, he repeated the trick, finding the net against Ballycran as Slaughtneil lted their fourth Ulster title. In this form, Rogers is unplayable. He hit scores from distance. He won dirty ball. He linked the play, and at crucial moments, he took off at a canter, beat the defenders and put the ball in the net. That ability has the effect of both unsettling opposition defences and getting maroon and white-clad supporters in the the stands on their feet. In the feedback, one respondent said Rogers was an absolute pleasure to watch and a reliable, classy player. Others said his selection was an easy choice and hailed him as a match winner, while a further response said no words needed. “He is the man that has driven Slaughtneil forward this year in both Derry and Ulster championships, and has been a class act,” suggested a further respondent. One response simply said the man is lethal. The Emmets will certainly hope so, and all of Rogers attributes will be required as they head into an All-Ireland semi final meeting with either Ballygunneror Kilmallock .

Young Hurler of the Year  McLaughlin celebrates his goal against Cootehill. Pic by Seamus McQuillan Mono Pix. Ruaidhriacute McLaughlin  In what has been a breakthrough season for the Na Magha corner forward, Ruaidhriacute McLaughlin has shown plenty of promise. With his side labouring against Cavan champions Cootehill in the Ulster quarter final, it was the young star who rattled the net to calm their nerves. McLaughlin is a lively attacker, whose clever movement has the result of both creating room for himself and freeing up space for his fellow forwards. His ability to appear in the right place at the right time was recognised in the feedback, with one respondent saying he got scores when they were needed at crucial times. Another said he slotted into the team with a quiet confidence, while a further response said he was the most committed young hurler in the county. “Brilliant young player. Fantastic, consistent playing at every match. Shines at every game and is an outstanding team player, always puts the team first,” added another. A fine season in the Antrim league as well as on the Derry and Ulster scene have laid the foundations for the Na Magha man to push forward in .

Pic by Cathal McOscar. googletag.cmd.push Eunan McElhennon  In a year where Desertmartin perfected the attack from deep-lying positions, McElhennon was a key weapon. Whether it was bursting forward with the ball, or getting on the end of a sweeping move, the electric half back was on the score sheet regularly. He found the net with an outstanding inidual effort in the Derry semi final win over Craigbane, and continued his scoring run throughout the Ulster championship campaign. One respondent on the feedback form pointed to McElhennons speed, strength and shooting, while another said you could play him anywhere on the pitch. A further response said he was the best half back in Derry and Ulster for his speed and skill on the ball, while another hailed him as an influential player. “He played some great, entertaining football and was very focused and smart on the field,” added another. One respondent simply nominated Runabout McElhennon, while another said he was easily the best player on the pitch in nearly every game this season. Ending the year with two junior medals to his name, along with his Desertmartin team mates, the half back can be well satisfied with his performances.  Young guns to get opportunity as Derry name McKenna Cup lineup  The Oakleafers start their campaign tomorrow night in Owenbeg.   Young Junior Footballer of the Year  Murray capped the season with his first start for Derry seniors last night. Pic by Cathal McOscar. Lachlan Murray  Murray wasnt even eligible for Desertmartins first junior success this season, but their full forward was busy anyway, helping secure Ulster and All-Ireland minor titles for Derry. Eager not to miss out, he added the  junior football title to his growing medal collection, and featured strongly in the run to the Ulster junior semi final. With St Martins clearly the team to beat at this level, they faced packed defences wherever they went, with Murray having to work hard to create the space he needed. And he did. Sean Dolans Rory McGurk used his experience to curb Murrays enthusiasm in the early stages of the county final, but he did what talented young players do. The teenager adapted his game and maintained his composure to slot six points from frees as Desertmartin eventually won by ten points.

Pic by Mary K Burke. googletag.cmd.push Neil Forester  “Is this real ” yelled a delirious Neil Forester at the end of his sides championship final win over Greenlough. Youd forgive him for asking. The Brian Oacutegs captain has seen years of heartache and near misses, and when the crunch arrived in November, he produced a huge performance to finally clamber over the line. Starting the game on Enda Lynn, he pushed forward in the latter stages and marshalled attack and defence, almost omnipresent as Steelstown ended their hurt. It typied the leadership he showed all season, and he was central also as Brian Oacutegs shook off what was historically their bogey team in Castledawson at the quarter final stage. The public feedback reflected the good will towards a man very few would begrudge a county championship medal. “He puts his head where you wouldnt put a sock,” said one respondent, while another simply said he was a brilliant leader. A further respondent said he was a real GAA man. “He does it all for his club, other clubs and schools all around Derry and still puts in big performances when it matters. Heart of a lion and wise beyond his years,” they said. A hugely important player for Hugh McGraths men, Forester will continue the search for silverware this weekend as Steelstown take on Moortown in the Ulster IFC final in Glen.  Young stars join up with Derrys provisional football squad  A number of the All-Ireand winning minor team are training with the seniors.   Young Intermediate Footballer of the Year  The young midfielders aerial prowess was key to the Brian Oacutegs effort. Pic by Mary K Burke. Donncha Gilmore  Its been quite a year for Donncha Gilmore. He picked up Ulster and All-Ireland titles with the Derry minors and ended the year with an intermediate championship medal. The midfielder belied his years with a series of confident, mature performances in a championship where seasoned giants are in plentul supply at centre field. With the county final in the melting pot, he rose to field the ball among a scattering of players, raising a roar from the crowd and lting his team mates. The Steelstown man was a popular choice throughout the public feedback, with his exploits in the Oakleaf jersey no doubt contributing. “He has been brilliant for Derry and Steelstown, an All-Ireland winner and a Derry championship winner, with more to come,” said one respondent. Another said he covered every blade of grass throughout the championship, while another – who was liberal with the blue and yellow heart emojis – said he was pure class. In a nod to the midfielders modesty and work ethic, another response said the young man has no idea just how good he is. Gilmore can look forward to Sundays Ulster IFC final as well, and will feature in manager Rory Gallaghers provisional squad for the upcoming season.

Pic by Philip Fitzpatrick Sportsfile. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McFaul  If great players have everything in their locker, Ciaran McFaul probably needed a second one last season. The Glen talisman was imperious in the number  role into which Malachy ORourke moulded him in . In the biggest game of the year, the county final against Slaughtneil, he hammered over three points and dictated the game in the same manner he had done all season. That Donegal champions St Eunans set out to shut him down in their Ulster SFC clash in Letterkenny is a mark of just how influential McFaul has been. His name also dominated the responses to our online poll, with one respondent in particular waxing lyrical, saying McFall was arguably the greatest talent ever produced in Derry football. “What an absolute work horse he is on the field, any position that man turns the bolts in any match. He can read a game super and his dummies are without a doubt the best in Ulster,” said another. A further respondent said he redefined the number  role, while another quite simply said the centre back was pure class. Able to dictate play from deep, he has arrived on the end of attacks with perfect timing, while also performing his defensive duties with commitment.  Derry manager looking for continuity after stop-start tenure to date  Rory Gallagher said he was delighted to see theof the McKenna Cup.   Young Senior Footballer of the Year  Doherty in action against Kilcoo in the Ulster semi final. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile. Ethan Doherty  Ethan Doherty was still at school when the Covid pandemic started. Less than two years later, he helped Glen lt the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time. Stepping straight into the first team at both club and county level, the rise of the former St Patricks College captain has been meteoric. Every inch the modern wing back, his power, pace and ability to break the line have been a key part of Malachy ORourkes Glen machine. The GAA community in Derry have also been quick to recognise his precocious talent, and he was a hugely popular choice in our public feedback. Amid numerous goat emojis, one respondent suggested he could play anywhere, while another said his selection as Young Player of the Year was merely common sense. “The engine of Glens back line with constant running. He never gave up and always looked to drive the ball forward to create scoring opportunities,” said a further response. One particular respondent kept it simple, nominating him for the award because he roasts everyone. Doherty is a player with a big future, and, already performing at the highest level for both club and county, the possibilities seem almost endless.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Caoimhín Doherty Jan Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Morgan Murray and Steelstown have their focus set on the club’s first ever Ulster intermediate final against Moortown at Glen on Sunday. googletag.cmd.push Steelstown are coming off the back of their first ever championship and they hope their support on the sideline will help them push on again and double their success. Murray admits his side will have to ‘dig deep’ against a strong team in what are likely to be tough conditions. “It’s evident after the county final that our fans played a big part in helping us over the line,” he said. “The support from them throughout the game was unbelievable and once that final whistle went, it was emotional celebrating with huge club figures who have been there so long. “It’s a special feeling having your family there on the day too, and when we got over the line, having them there made the victory that much sweeter.” Winning the county final was special, says Murray. Pic by Mary K Burke. The -year-old also added how he expects another big turnout despite the weather conditions. An All-Ireland semi final is the prize for the winners, but Morgan insists the ‘Oacutegs’ are not looking that far ahead. “We don’t like to get too far ahead of ourselves, we always just take it one game at a time,” he said. “Obviously,the situation comes that we’re in an All-Ireland semi final, we will be more than prepared, but at the minute, Moortown on Sunday is where our focus lies.” This is Morgan’s first year on the senior side after impressing last year with Steelstown’s reserve team. Murray admits it was a dficult campaign for himself last season with injuries and missing out on senior football. “I was training with the seniors but wasn’t getting to play with the seniors, so I was playing reserve football,” he said. “That was disappointing, and injuries didn’t help, but it just motivated me to push myself on to demand my place on the senior squad. “Reserve football gave me the opportunity to enjoy my football again. “And as I said, I was still in around the seniors, seeing how far they had gone having reached the final and seeing that togetherness, it gave me the drive to be part of it.”  CDP Team of the Year : Intermediate Football  We take a look at the players who made the final XV.   The left-footed forward’s drive and determination in last year’s campaign has landed him where he is today in the Steelstown senior squad. “Thankfully this year, my coaches have put a lot of faith in me and that’s pushing me to perform week in week out,” he said. “I’m very grateful to have had a big part in the team this year and winning the club’s first ever Championship is something that will stay with me forever.” The Pennyburn man has scored a championship total of - and earned his place in the County Derry Post’s Intermediate Team of the Year for  – alongside seven of his teammates. Going into the final, Moortown have an average of . points conceded per game while Steelstown sit at . points. The Derry men are typically big scorers in their games, but Morgan played down the signicance of the statistics. “I don’t think they’re relevant, to be honest,” he said. “It’s an Ulster championship final so anything can happen, but I’m confident that come the final whistle, we’ll have done enough to win the game.”  PREVIEW: Tyrone champions will be Ulster final favourites, says McGrath  Steelstown take on Moortown in Sundays intermediate decider.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Peter Devlin hit each of Moortowns scores in that period, while Cahir McMonagle responded with Steelstowns first score on  minutes. But it was a frustrating first half for the Derry side who hit four wides as they struggled to replicate their usual free-scoring game. It required a dferent type of skill in the second half and when McMonagle struck again just nine minutes in, Brian Ogs had hope. Time continued to tick away but  minutes into the second period, McMonagle struck his third point, a real beauty to tie up the game at -, and the travelling Steelstown crowd sensed the title was there for the taking. With just minutes remaining, Emmet Deane first Steelstown into the lead for the first time, and when McMonagle hit his fourth point of the game soon after, the job was almost done. Con Heron fisted the ball over the bar for Moortowns first core of the second half to make it a one-point game again, but in the dying seconds McMonagle struck again, with the final whistle following shortly afterwards to confirm Steelstown Brian Ogs as the Ulster champions for the first time in the clubs history.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Steelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!Second half comeback sees Brian Ogs overcome MoortownSteelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Moortown - Steelstown - Steelstown Brian Ogs are the Ulster Intermediate champions after a determined second half showing to overcome Moortown at Owenbeg. googletag.cmd.push Hugh McGraths team looked to be in some trouble as they managed just one single score in the entirety of the first half, and trailed -, - at the break, having struggled to get through Moortowns blanket defence. Peter Devlin hit each of Moortowns scores in that period, while Cahir McMonagle responded with Steelstowns first score on  minutes. But it was a frustrating first half for the Derry side who hit four wides as they struggled to replicate their usual free-scoring game. It required a dferent type of skill in the second half and when McMonagle struck again just nine minutes in, Brian Ogs had hope. Time continued to tick away but  minutes into the second period, McMonagle struck his third point, a real beauty to tie up the game at -, and the travelling Steelstown crowd sensed the title was there for the taking. With just minutes remaining, Emmet Deane first Steelstown into the lead for the first time, and when McMonagle hit his fourth point of the game soon after, the job was almost done. Con Heron fisted the ball over the bar for Moortowns first core of the second half to make it a one-point game again, but in the dying seconds McMonagle struck again, with the final whistle following shortly afterwards to confirm Steelstown Brian Ogs as the Ulster champions for the first time in the clubs history.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Orlagh Mullan Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Sunday th January  is a day that Steelstown will never forget. The day that they became champions of Ulster for the first time in their history. googletag.cmd.push Just two and a half months after winning their first Derry championship, the men of Brian Oacuteg’s came through their toughest challenge yet to overcome a dogged Moortown by - to - at a packed Owenbeg. Having dispatched of Cloughaneely, Donaghmoyne and Butlersbridge in some style on their way to the provincial showpiece, this was a totally dferent game in which Steelstown where often frustrated and only led for the first time in the th minute but, by the final whistle, they didn’t care one bit.  As manager Hugh McGrath took in the scenes of blue and gold on the field afterwards, he said it was a special and unforgettable day for the people of Steelstown, and also paid tribute to the late Brian Oacuteg McKeever after whom the club is named. “We thought Derry champions sounded good, but Ulster champions certainly has a ring to it! When you put the hard work in that these lads have and you’ve had so many close calls and disappointments, to get over the line in something so close and so tight and so nervy – it just means even more. Steelstown as Ulster champions is one that will live in the memory for a long time,” he said. “All week leading up to it there was an excitement in the group about being in the final but the big thing we were saying was that we were so proud that Brian Oacuteg’s name was being mentioned on a provincial level and in some places on a national level. For us that’s huge. McGrath continued: “We all know in the city what he was about and why we’re named after him, but when you see the way we dug that out today – that’s Brian Oacuteg McKeever. That spirit is exactly what it was. “We’re really proud. Lots of teams say that they’re proud, but we are immensely proud of getting that name on the map and hopefully we can get it on the national stage and make even more people aware of that. Evenit’s just to get them interested and to find out why we’re called Brian Oacuteg’s – great – because that story needs to be told all over.” DREAM COME TRUE As Steelstown captain Neil Forester made his way up the steps of Owenbeg to collect the cup, the only words he could utter were ‘this is the stuff of dreams.’ “It hasn’t sunk in,” admitted Forester afterwards. “There was maybe huge relief and satisfaction after the county final, but this is a dferent level. “Getting out of Derry was such a big thing for us because we just hadn’t done it. I kept saying just get past Cloughaneely in the first round and then you get the ball rolling then you don’t know what can happen with the momentum. We were brilliant that day, but the crossbar still had to save us and maybe that was that little bit of luck we needed. “This team has just grown and grown. To win an Ulster title against a fantastic and dogged Moortown team in conditions that probably suited them and their defensive style is special. The fact that all those habits and the hard work that we put in has paid off. “It’s literally unbelievable. We were talking about getting our monkey off the back in Derry but once we did that we have just kicked on so much. I honestly don’t know what  to say.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

As manager Hugh McGrath took in the scenes of blue and gold on the field afterwards, he said it was a special and unforgettable day for the people of Steelstown, and also paid tribute to the late Brian Oacuteg McKeever after whom the club is named. “We thought Derry champions sounded good, but Ulster champions certainly has a ring to it! When you put the hard work in that these lads have and you’ve had so many close calls and disappointments, to get over the line in something so close and so tight and so nervy – it just means even more. Steelstown as Ulster champions is one that will live in the memory for a long time,” he said. “All week leading up to it there was an excitement in the group about being in the final but the big thing we were saying was that we were so proud that Brian Oacuteg’s name was being mentioned on a provincial level and in some places on a national level. For us that’s huge. McGrath continued: “We all know in the city what he was about and why we’re named after him, but when you see the way we dug that out today – that’s Brian Oacuteg McKeever. That spirit is exactly what it was. “We’re really proud. Lots of teams say that they’re proud, but we are immensely proud of getting that name on the map and hopefully we can get it on the national stage and make even more people aware of that. Evenit’s just to get them interested and to find out why we’re called Brian Oacuteg’s – great – because that story needs to be told all over.” DREAM COME TRUE As Steelstown captain Neil Forester made his way up the steps of Owenbeg to collect the cup, the only words he could utter were ‘this is the stuff of dreams.’ “It hasn’t sunk in,” admitted Forester afterwards. “There was maybe huge relief and satisfaction after the county final, but this is a dferent level. “Getting out of Derry was such a big thing for us because we just hadn’t done it. I kept saying just get past Cloughaneely in the first round and then you get the ball rolling then you don’t know what can happen with the momentum. We were brilliant that day, but the crossbar still had to save us and maybe that was that little bit of luck we needed. “This team has just grown and grown. To win an Ulster title against a fantastic and dogged Moortown team in conditions that probably suited them and their defensive style is special. The fact that all those habits and the hard work that we put in has paid off. “It’s literally unbelievable. We were talking about getting our monkey off the back in Derry but once we did that we have just kicked on so much. I honestly don’t know what  to say.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made. I would expect nothing less from one of the best people I ever knew. Thank you for everything Sean. Until we meet again.

Festival organisers plan to give out the honours at an in-person event in the coastal Calornia town on March  . The eight actors singled out for the award also include newcomers, such as Saniyya Sidney, who plays Venus Williams in King Richard, and Coda’s Emilia Jones and Troy Kotsur, as well as more familiar faces, including Simon Rexand Dornan. The event, hosted by TCM’s Dave Karger, will include discussions with the talent – which could for some be a stop on the road to the Oscars on March . Karger said the honorees are “integral parts of the season’s most exciting and emotional films”. Previous recipients have included Zendaya, Riz Ahmed and Awkwafina. The long-running film festival, now in its th year, regularly attracts more than , attendees to the idyllic town for films,  and tributes. The full line-up for the early March gathering will be unveiled in February.

Registration had opened months in advance and entries sold out in record time, a clear indication that this race has become a firm favourite for the elite and the not so elite runner.For most, it is the sense of turning up on the day not knowing what to expect. The race has two unique selling points.Firstly, you have to run with a partner and you are only ever as good as your other half.Many alliances come unstuck on the hills and in the mud and friendships are often lost, regained and lost again as the race unfolds.Secondly, and perhaps more uniquely, only a select few know the course in advance and they are sworn to secrecy.This is unusual in that most of us go to a race knowing what to expect in terms of distance, terrain and elevation: not so with this one.The only information is that it begins and ends in Castlewellan and it is between eight-and-a-half and nine miles .The course this year was a very tightly guarded secret with only those entrusted to assist with the marking on the eve of the race getting any real insight.When asked to describe the course, the Prophet simply stated: lsquoit will stun the legs and play with the headrsquo.These words rang in my head as I ran around fields that I never expected to, climbed hills that I never climbed before and at one point,my eyesight is not failing, saw Sherpa Tenzing throwing down ropes and herding a cabinet of yaks.At the business end of proceeding, there was some real class on parade with Irish mountain running sensation Zak Hannapaired with Andrew Annett , a man in great form as evidenced by his superb win in the Armagh Ten.This international pairing with real climbing pedigree firmly lived up to their billing as odds-on favourites and were almost three minutes ahead of their nearest challengers, the youthful pairing of Jared Martinand Tom Crudgington .With many years of running ahead, both these young men are capable of winning the race in the not-too-distant future.The podium was completed by the last minute pairing of Jonny Scottand Aaron McGrady , who hooked up on the morning of the event due to late withdrawals.The chemistry was clearly good and the partnership worked as they came home in just over  minutes ndash  seconds adrt of Martin and Crudgington.The ladiesrsquo race was a tighter affair with Amanda Perry and Denise Logue from Ballydrain winning by  seconds from Dearbhla Coxand Niamh Donnelly .The podium was completed by Clair Quigley and Fiona McQuillan .The mixed team event is always closely fought and this year was no dferent. With a mile to go to the finish, eventual winners Aidan Brownand Nakita Burkewere still under pressure from Stephen Connolly and Caitlyn Harvey from North Down AC.However, in the final twists and turns the former prevailed and ran out winners by around a minute, finishing eighth and tenth overall respectively.The podium was completed by Neil McGeough, Newcastlersquos rising star, and his partner, Irish Olympian Kerry OrsquoFlaherty, an athlete more at home on the track and over barriers than climbing ditches.Throughout the field there was great camaraderie and the craic was mighty. Social media was buzzing after the race with participants commenting that this was the best course they had ever ran over, despite the numerous challenges that it presented.The race organisers are indebted to everyone, too many to mention inidually, who contributed in any way to the success of the event.It brought great joy to those taking part and spectating at a time when anything that improves our well-being is something to celebrate..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"McCartan hopes for dream start back at the helm  ","story":"DOWN manager James McCartan will be looking for a dream start to hisat the helm this Friday when his Mourne side take on Donegal in the first round of the Dr McKenna Cup.The red and black outfit will travel to MacCumhail Park for a .pm throw-in, in what will be the first piece of action for the county this year.The ing fan favourite will not be under any illusions as to the level of stf competition his footballers will face off against, as they travel to the home of last yearrsquos Ulster semi-finalists.Antrim are the other outfit that make up Section A, with Down welcoming the Saffrons to Newry in their second game next Tuesday.McCartan has already faced adversities in his second stint as boss before his team have even lined out, due to a number of regular Mourne players ruled out of contention.Carryduff duo James Guinness and Owen McCabe, Bryansford shot-stopper Marc Reid and experienced Burren duo Gerard McGovern and Donal OrsquoHare are among those unavailable.The former All-Star man in charge, alongside assistant Aidan OrsquoRourke, have already began drafting in suitable replacements and have recently been given a notable boost in the form of ing former captain Niall McParland.The Glenn clubman has ed following three years teaching in Doha, Qatar, and will be someone who McCartan looks to in order to bring his wealth of experience to the rest of the side ndashespecially those who are up and coming talents.ldquoThe squad has changed but itrsquos good to see some new faces in the , said McParland.ldquoJames and Aidan have a handle on everyone in the county and they have a good squad together so far.ldquoI was happy to get the call to go back because I didnrsquot knowI would get it ndash I donrsquot take anything for granted, he continued.ldquoNow Irsquom fighting for my place in the team.Alongside this encouraging news for the county, current star Barry OrsquoHagan believes Down could benefit even further from an influx of Kilcoo players.However, the current champions of Down are currently hoping to retain their Ulster title when they face off against Derrygonnelly on January , which will see them out of action until things unfold.With this meaning they will not be available for selection for the Dr McKenna Cup, this doesnrsquot necessarily rule out some of the  featuring in the Division Two league campaign.ldquoAt the minute, therersquos probably eight or nine of them you would definitely want in, said OrsquoHagan.ldquoWhether they commit or not I donrsquot know, itrsquos up to those men, but you need the talent and the experience those boys have.ldquoObviously their full focus is on Kilcoo at the minute, as yoursquod expect..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_TableTennis.jpg","title":"Owenbeg are on title march  ","story":"IT was an early Christmas present for Owenbeg with a double win over St Johnrsquos to keep their Division One title hopes on track.The current league champions still have three outstanding matches with league leaders Banbridge, so it is still all to play for in this ision.In Division Two, Drumaness kept their title hopes alive with their win over St Johnrsquos.

He also taught commercial subjects like arithmetic and bookkeeping, for use in commerce and industry.Dr Neilson and his clergymen sons were notable for their warm cross-denominational outlook.Fr Luke Walsh, PP in North Antrim, near Ballycastle, spoke highly of his old Kilmore tutor: ldquoI was educated by a Presbyterian clergyman, a man of as great moral worth and sterling integrity as Ireland could boast of.In , as Bishop of Down and Dromore, William Crolly described Rev James Neilson of Downpatrick as ldquoone of the most liberal and respected clergymen in Co Down.Around  Moses began compiling an Irish grammar, later assisted by his son William. In their pursuit of Irish studies, the two Neilsons collaborated with Patrick Lynch, principal of a distinguished Irish and Classical academy in Loughinisland, six miles away.In March  William Neilson was installed as minister of Dundalk Presbyterian Church. This was a perfect fit for his developing academic interests. Attached to the Dundalk congregation was a colony of Gaelic-speaking Scots Presbyterians living in Ballymascanlon.Originally from Argylle, they had fought for King William in . Hence it was a standing requirement that the congregationrsquos clergy be fluent in Irish.William thrived in Dundalk. In the late s Irish was still the first language with large parts of the population in Down and Louth . He preached widely in Irish. In July  he went on a preaching tour of Ulster, achieving wide popularity.RebellionBack in Co Down, and during the  Rebellion period, his preaching activities on one occasion brought him into collision with the military authorities. His father was actually Moderator in the year of the Rising.Dr Moses needed permission from General Nugent to hold the General Synodin Lurgan that August. One Sunday in  his son William was invited back to his fatherrsquos church, to preach in Irish. The event generated considerable interest, and the church was packed.The authorities were nervous in the wake of the rebellion and news of this unusually large assembly soon reached official ears.Halfway through the sermon a party of yeomen entered the church. With no space left to seat them, they occupied the twin staircases leading up to the pulpit. When William had finished preaching they promptly arrested him, and seized theof his sermon.The soldiers involved were likely from the Kilmore Yeomanry. Their Lieutenant at the time was Charles Hamilton, William Strain of Kilmore was a sergeant, and Patrick Soy of \"Tollinagrew\" a private.They marched William all the way to Down Gaol in Downpatrick, newly opened on the Mall in  . Their arrival likely caused some consternation with the Gaol Governor, because the Neilson clergy were widely known to be loyal to the Crown.Rev William bailed by Rev JamesScrambling to smooth over this military faux pas, the Governor sent across town for James Neilson, brother of the prisoner, and minister of the nearby Stream Street Presbyterian congregation. The Rev William was then bailed into the custody of the Rev James,with instructions to appear in court next day.Next morning the magistrate encountered a dficulty mdash he couldnrsquot understand the manuscript of Williamrsquos sermon, preached in Irish the day before. William helpfully offered to translate. It transpired the contents were innocuous, and the prisoner was promptly released. The details of this intriguing episode were recorded a century later by a Neilson descendant .Academic careerIn Dundalk William ran a Classical and mercantile academy similar to his fatherrsquos. In an astonishing burst of creativity, he continued to develop his skills as a linguist.In  he published Greek exercises in syntax, ellipsis, dialects, prosody and metaphrasis. In recognition of this, Glasgow University awarded him an honorary DD in . In  he was elected Presbyterian Moderator. In  he published Introduction to the Irish language, on the basis of which he was elected MRIA in .There were a number of advantages in learning Irish, William explained. For academics, it gave essential insights into other European languages. And for the wider population, it enabled competent communication with those large sections of the population whose first language was still Irish.In contemporary Ireland, he asserted, clergymen, lawyers and farmers could not conduct their business properly without a knowledge of Irish.Paradoxically, the subjects taught in schools run by the Neilson clergy, and others, eventually undermined the use of Irish nationally. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and employment opportunities in industry and commerce were exploding.For those without a knowledge of English, Irish-only fluency was becoming an overwhelming disadvantage. When the new national school system was instituted in Ireland in , teachers knew that English was now the essential passport to wider employment.The great Daniel OrsquoConnell ruefully acknowledged the new reality. ldquoAlthough the language is associated with many recollections that twine round the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication is so great, that I can witness, without a sigh, the gradual disuse of Irish.At that time there were a number of ieties of Irish, but under the new dispensation the vernacular spoken in East Ulster eventually became extinct. Fortunately William Neilson preserved many Co Down examples in his  Grammar. In the words of his descendant Joseph Nelson, Williamrsquos ldquodialogues and familiar phrases, which form the second part, are a complete guide to the ideas as well as the phrases of the peasantry.Untimely deathIn  William was appointed professor of classical languages and Hebrew at the Belfast Academical Institution. In April  he was elected professor of Classics at Glasgow University. However, he had contracted rheumatic fever, and died on the th of that month, aged only . He was buried in the family vault close to the west gable of his fatherrsquos church in Rademon.A full colour pamphlet based on this article has been produced by Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Group, to accompany Joyce Gibsonrsquos ongoing Irish language classes in Ballynahinch Market House..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5January2022_LinenHall.jpg","title":"Tributes to former chief librarian at Linen Hall Library who was also decorated Gaelic player  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND man who was the custodian of some of Northern Irelandrsquos most precious books and written history will be buried tomorrow.The former chief librarian of Belfastrsquos Linen Hall Library, John Killen was hailed as a ldquogentleman and friend to all after he died peacefully at his home on Sunday.A respected author, historian and former Gaelic footballer, Mr Killen was aged .He had worked at Irelandrsquos oldest and last subion library for  years and became friends with some of its most regular visitors, such as the poet Seamus Heaney, writers Sam Hanna Bell, John Hewitt, Joseph Tomelty and the artist Padraic Woods.Mr Killen retired in January , after taking up his first role as an Irish reference librarian at the Linen Hall in .He was known for continuing the work of a former colleague, Jimmy Vitty, by establishing an extensive political papers section of posters, prisonersrsquo books and records from the Maze Long Kesh.The collection houses more than , separate items and is now used by academics and students from across the world.Among the many books written by Mr Killen was the story of the  year-old library, along with the Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.One of his most recent books was The St Patrickrsquos Treasury, a celebration of the myths, legends and traditions of Irelandrsquos patron saint who is buried in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Mr Killen was also highly regarded as a county hurler and Gaelic footballer who won championship medals, having played for his home club Loughinisland, Downpatrickrsquos RGU and Queenrsquos.Loughinisland GAC said on social media the club was ldquodevastated to learn of Mr Killenrsquos death who had also been a member and secretary in .He won two championship medals with the club in  and .Mr Killen, who was reared in Saul, started as a Gaelic footballer with RGU.He won several Minor championships medals for the Downpatrick side, including leading them to victory over Loughinisland in the SFC final in .Queenrsquos GAA remembered on social media how Mr Killen was a former Sigerson Cup player from - and was also part of the first All-Ireland Freshers winning team in .The Linen Hall Library shared its reaction to the sad news on social media.It said of its former head: ldquoJohn joined the Library in  and dedicated the next  years to this institution.

No doubt women are also disproportionately affected by austerity including the cuts to Universal Credit and cuts to public sector jobs.ldquoIt is sad that still today, women continue to face long standing structural inequalities that push more women out of employment and into a state of economic deadlock.Taking a male view point on the subject, Cllr Glyn Hanna said: ldquoI have been involved in politics for years and also have a business. I have seen on many occasions that there remain equality issues for women in work places.ldquoI have three daughters who all have professional jobs. I have been told by them of their experiences of sexual discrimination and inequality and their feelings that they have to work harder to get respect doing a job.

Forwe donrsquot work together, then nothing changes.ldquoMy programmes are embracing, not preaching. They aim to break down the dferences we have as a society by promoting better knowledge, tolerance and understanding.ldquoThe laws that govern us all, especially those written in relation to females, do definitely need to change for equality to happen.She continued: ldquoWe, as a society, also have to encourage change from the ground level up. Educating our young people and changing adult preconceived perceptions are also so important.ldquoBoys and girls, men and women. We are all iniduals who should be treated fairly and equally. By law, and by society in general.ldquoIt is therefore important to engage and stand up for change now.

Henry McDonald writes: \"Millions of others in Oz have stoically put up with the emergency health measures in their country for nearly two years. Why should the world’s greatest tennis player be treated any dferent from anyone  \" As someone with a compromised immune system, on eight tablets per day and only ten per cent of my stomach left after le-saving surgeryI was advised by my heart and oncology consultants to avoid any exposure to the pandemic.For nearly two years I swerved Coronavirus by adhering strictly to lockdown rules, wearing a mask when out, isolating, social distancing etc. When the welcome vaccines arrived, I readily embraced them and am now tripled jabbed. Anda fourth vaccine is offered and deemed essential to combat further spread of the disease, I will happily stick out my arm and get jagged.Despite all these precautions and the vaccinations, I finally succumbed to the virus over the New Year albeit of the Omicron iety. After emerging from seven days of pandemic purdah I can report that this strain was not as debilitating as the previous ones that have killed more than a million people around the world while seriously affecting the health of millions of others.The infection began with a burst of chills spreading all over the body leaving my frame shaking slightly for  hours. Then my throat started to scratch and ache while my nose ran repeatedly for under a week. Yet that was it. The worst symptoms of the infection petered out within a couple of days and the whole experience felt like a bad case of a winter cold not even flu. I have no doubt that having the booster jab back in November helped me quickly get over the Omicron virus.It was a mixed picture inside our bubble at home in Belfast: my sister tested negative throughout while her partner also caught the virus. His symptoms were even milder than mine and he too was triple vaccinated ahead of Omicron’s arrival.As for the source of our infections there were a host of potential viral triggers ranging from one friend who is unvaccinated to the disturbingly high number of peopleunmasked on a Glider journey from my partner’s house in Ballyhackamore into the city centre just after Christmas.Meanwhile my eldest daughter was felled by the virus shortly after Boxing Day in Australia her younger sister had been one of the early casualties of the first coronavirus wave which engulfed her Glasgow University student halls of residence back in the autumn of .Regarding the older daughter it is worth pointing out that she and her friends were caught in one of the most stringent lockdowns in the world in Melbourne for months on end. Despite the tight strictures on their lives in that shut down ‘Down Under’ they regarded it as necessary. They endured. They got through.This is why I have no sympathy for Novak Djokovic who is at the time of writing in lockdown in a government run hostel in Australia. He refuses to get vaccinated and is all over social media preaching against the vaccination programmes saving lives across the planet. Millions of others in Oz have stoically put up with the emergency health measures in their country for nearly two years. Why should the world’s greatest tennis player be treated any dferent from anyone  ! The longer the Australian government stand firm on the issue the more I shall admire them.One of the by-products of the pandemic and lockdown has been my own small act of solidarity with Australia, a nation that thousands of us in this part of the world have strong family connections with.During these years of the plague, I fell in love again with Aussie wine. I started searching wine merchants and supermarket shelves for Australian vino not just because I appreciate a decent Shiraz or robust Cabernet from down there. Australian wine makers have been one of the targets of a Chinese boycott after Canberra simply dared to ask for an independent international inquiry into how the virus originated in Wuhan.The dictatorship in Beijing was mfed that Australia even questioned their official narrative about how Covid- was unleashed on the world. China under Mr Xi’s tyrannical rule then imposed sanctions on Aussie exports including wine as a punishment for speaking out of turn. Anyone enraged at the cover up in Wuhan and the bullying behaviour of Beijing should support Australia while out shopping so long as that boycott continues.As I say small acts of solidarity but necessary ones ... a bit like getting vaccinated here in Northern Irelandnot for yourself then for the lives of others.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

He deceived his partners in the multiparty talks, negotiating in secret with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness terms of appeasement which would never have been made public but for the Downey trial in .The sequence of events through which Blair abused the authority of his office is clearly set out in Austen Morgan’s Tony Blair and the IRA .The salient facts are these:• Sinn Féin IRA did not sign up to the Belfast Agreement in April •  they continued to demand further concessions from the British government• their main bargaining counter was the threat of renewed violence• Blair conceded their two main demands: the early release of IRA prisoners and an undertaking that specied IRA fugitives from justice would not be pursued or prosecuted.These concessions constituted political interference in and undermined the operation of the criminal justice system. If a victim of IRA terrorism had known what had been agreed, they could have initiated a judicial review with a strong prospect of success. Blair usurped the role of the Crown Prosecution Service overrode the professional advice of his Attorney-General and abused the power of his office.But all this was done in secret, so no victim could have challenged it.Dr WB Smith, Belfast Ben Lowry: Tony Blair was a flawed PM but of course he should be called Sir——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

As you will have heard in the media, this new Omicron iant of COVID is very infectious. But it does not appear to cause serious illnessyou have been double or triple vaccinated. But frankly I am shocked how badly the biochemistry of this virus has been explained by politicians and so-called experts. As a biochemist with an international reputation please forgive meI try to explain. When you are vaccinated in the arm the main antibody generated is called IgG. This should stop serious illness. But when you get infected in the respiratory tract you also produce another type called IgA. This is secreted into the tract. Also, there is a dferent T-lymphocyte response when you are infected directly there. So, vaccination in the arm will not necessarily stop you getting COVID because your vaccination doesnt activate the IgA production sufficiently. Furthermore, for your immune system to activate against COVID, you have to produce some of the virus and its antigen. This would make you test positive by PCR, which is very sensitive, and probably by lateral flow. Thus, the problem is thatyou get COVID, even mildly, then you would have to isolate for ten days, and this would spoil Christmas again. We can’t risk this. That is why Penarth Bridge Club will close until th January . But here is an interesting hand from last week where the challenge for North South was to bid a slam. But which one – six hearts or seven clubs The AuctionSouth opened the auction with his five-card heart suit. North with fteen points knows game must be on, and maybe a slam. So, he bid two clubs. South felt his hand was strong enough now to reverse, keeping his support for clubs till a later bid. North was tempted to jump to four hearts but this might prevent them reaching a slam. So, he bid three hearts, knowing his partner would bid on after his reverse bid of two spades. Indeed, South now needed to show his support for clubs and so bid four clubs. North now bid four no trumps, Roman key card Blackwood. They were playing   so South’s response of five diamonds must show three key cards with clubs as trumps. North now could see seven clubs must be on, as South’s key cards must be the ace of spades, the ace of hearts and the king of clubs..removeThe playTrick  – East led the queen of diamonds, declarer winning the trick with his ace of diamonds, discarding a spade from dummy. Trick  – North considered the hand. Was he going to take the spade finesse  In fact,the hearts were   or   then he could discard his losing spade on the final heart. But trumps first. He played the ace of clubs from his hand. Trick  – He followed this by winning the next trick with dummy’s king of clubs. Good news. The defenders trumps were  , so he would not have to risk taking the spade finesse. Tricks ,  and  - Declarer then won the next three tricks with his king and queen and dummy’s ace of hearts. Trick  – He then ruffed a heart in his hand, establishing dummy’s last heart as a winner. Trick  – Declarer then ed to dummy by ruffing a diamond. Trick  – He then played dummy’s winning last heart, discarding the two of spades from his hand. Tricks  and  – He then played the ace of spades, followed by a small spade which he ruffed in hand. Trick – Declarer then ruffed his last losing diamond with dummy’s last trump. Tricks  – Declarer then claimed the last trick with his remaining club, the grand slam making with thirteen tricks for score of  - one spade, four hearts, one diamond, two diamond ruffs in dummy, and five clubs in hand. Well bid and well played. Six hearts makes but not seven, because East held four trumps.What have we learnt . It is often a good idea to show your partner a strong hand by reversing, as here, before showing support for his suit.. Once again Roman key card Blackwood.is an essential part of your armoury to reach a slam.. Always checkyou can establish small cards in a suit by ruffing before considering a finesse.Penarth club resultsFriday  December . Trish Tracey and Tony Campbell. Jim Elder and Meryl Skipper.
