But UK firms have warned that training up new drivers, to make up for an exodus of European Union hauliers because of Brexit and Covid, can’t happen fast enough to fix the crisis.  They have been urging ministers to add HGV drivers to the shortage occupations list, so that EU drivers can obtain visas to help fix the supply chain crisis. Here’s our story on the fuel rationing: On the face of things, the Bank of England is asleep at the wheel and should be taking steps to ease growing price pressures.... but it’s not quite that simple, as our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The nine-member MPC, which includes the governor, Andrew Bailey, said Ofgem’s hike in the household energy price cap in October, amid record wholesale gas and electricity prices, would lead to a fresh burst in inflationary pressure this winter. New applications for unemployment support rose by 16,000 last week to 351,000, dashing hopes of a fall to 320,000. Strip out seasonal adjustments, though, and jobless claims jumped by over 40,000 to around 306k. Both figures are sharply above pre-pandemic levels, although much lower than at the height of the crisis. Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, urges caution...  The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) showed that growth in private sector output slowed in August as firms battled with severe shortages while costs rose at the fastest pace since the late 1990s. In a sign that the economic recovery from lockdown is waning, business expectations for the year ahead fell to their lowest since January and new orders eased to a seven-month low. More here. ITV are reporting that BP has told the government that it plans to restrict deliveries of petrol and diesel to its network of service stations to ensure continuity of supply. It’s another sign that the UK’s shortage of lorry drivers is hitting the economy, having already caused disruption for retailers such as supermarkets.  Joel Hills, ITV’s Business and Economics Editor, explains: But, James Smith of ING argues that this is premature given the “many headwinds facing the growth outlook over the winter”.  He predicts a rate hike in the second half of next year is more likely than the first. Smith points out the energy price surge will hit the cost of living, while the end of the furlough scheme could also push up unemployment. Singh also warns that inflation pressures are likely to continue into 2022, with the current spike in gas prices adding to price pressures. The minutes of its MPC meeting say: The Committee also spent some time discussing the “surprisingly high number of jobs” still recorded as being furloughed -- around 1.7m in July -- even though vacancies are at record highs. One possibility was that some companies are using the CJRS (Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme) to “hoard labour” ahead of an expected recovery in demand. But, the cost of that strategy increased in July when firms started paying a share of furloughed staff wages. Another is that furloughed workers took second jobs with alternative employers, or worked more hours with existing second jobs, which is allowed under the CJRS. However, that doesn’t really square with high vacancy rates... The MPC considered another hypothesis: shifts in the pattern of demand during the pandemic mean those on furlough were not suitable matches for the job vacancies currently available.  And that, the Bank warns, means any increase in unemployment following the end of the CJRS might, at least in part, be “more structural than cyclical”. Sterling has gained almost a cent against the US dollar to $1.3715, as investors and traders predict an earlier rise in borrowing costs - possibly as soon as March 2022. Oliver Blackbourn, multi-asset portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, said deputy governor Dave Ramsden has turned more hawkish, by voting to end QE bond-buying early: The Bank blames ‘base effects’ for the majority of that surge (a year ago, food and drink prices fell due to the Eat Out to Help Out scheme). It also points to global cost pressures, and supply bottlenecks, driving up UK consumer goods prices.  But, the Bank also acknowledges that people expect higher inflation: The Bank warns that supply constraints are hurting growth - from a lack of raw materials to staff shortages. The Bank also warns the pace of the world’s economic recovery also shows signs of slowing, with global inflationary pressures still strong, and signs that cost pressures may prove more persistent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/632b2396ceb63f828ca19c914547fdeb82a1aee9/0_134_5831_3498/master/5831.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=182564754c93a71ac8183832024d9470","title":"labour keir starmer covid coronavirus live news latest updates","story":"In blue wall seats (defined as Conservative held ones that might be vulnerable, because they voted remain), Labour has made some progress since the general election – partly at the expense of the Lib Dems. YouGov says the party could gain 12 of these seats at an election. But in the red wall seats (former Labour ones that went Tory in 2019), the party is not seeing its vote rise. However, it could still win back 17 seats at an election because Conservative support has been falling, YouGov says. Asked which two principles he would only partially support, Barwell replied: As Bloom explains, this means that, instead of losing 63p in benefit for every £1 earned, claimants might only lose 60p. He says: Downing Street has declined to comment on the report, on the grounds that decisions such as this are announced in the budget.A common complaint is that they are too bland, and that as a result Boris Johnson (or almost anyone else) would happily make these pledges too. Broadly that is true, although it might be helpful to rank them in three categories: Starmer pledges that Johnson could easily match pledges that Johnson could match, but would define differently and pledges that Johnson would find problematic. Pledges that Johnson would easily match 1) We will always put hard-working families and their priorities first. This is the sort of thing politicians the world over have been saying at least since the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was elected in America promising to stand up for people who “work hard and play by the rules”. The Starmer essay includes two references to people who WHAPBTR, and the Conservative 2019 manifesto also included references to the HWF (hard-working families), their alternative incarnation in this boilerplate political lingo. 2) The role of government is to be a partner to private enterprise, not stifle it. Again, Johnson would be more than happy to include this line in his next manifesto. (To be fair to Starmer, this pledge is more to do with differentiating himself from Jeremy Corbyn than from Johnson. Corbyn would never have said he was in favour of stifling business, but enough voters suspected he was for this to be a problem.) Pledges that Johnson would match, but define differently 3) If you work hard and play by the rules, you should be rewarded fairly. The only thing that might stop Johnson speaking up for the WHAPBTR crowd would be an aversion to cliché, but - as the differences between Labour and the Conservatives on the national living wage (and much else) show - Johnson would apply an alternative definition of “fairly”. 4) People and businesses are expected to contribute to society, as well as receive. Johnson would agree with this, but he would point out that people and businesses already contribute a lot through their taxes. Starmer seems to be suggesting some of them should contribute more. 5) Your chances in life should not be defined by the circumstances of your birth – hard work and how you contribute should matter. Johnson would agree too. Although privileged himself, he would argue privately that he has achieved success in life through talent and hard work. But Starmer is here implying that the system is rigged against those not born into privilege - something Johnson would be less willing to accept.  6) The government must play its role in restoring honesty, decency and transparency in public life. Johnson would claim to support this principle - no one is openly opposed to honesty and decency - but his record on issues like telling the truth and following probity rules means he would struggle to argue this principle with conviction. 7) We are proudly patriotic but we reject the isiveness of nationalism. Johnson claims to reject isiveness, although his culture war record casts doubt on his sincerity in this regard. This line may be aimed as much at the SNP (who feature quite prominently in Starmer’s essay) as much as the Conservatives. But even the SNP are a bit squeamish about being called nationalists, and Nicola Sturgeon herself has said it might be better if her party had a different name. Pledges that Johnson might find problematic 8) The government should treat taxpayer money as if it were its own. The current levels of waste are unacceptable. Johnson obviously could not endorse this, because the second sentence is directly critical of his record. He would be happy to sign up to the first sentence, although it has clearly been included to imply that, as the scandal about PPE contracts revealed, the Tories are misusing public money. 9) Families, communities and the things that bring us together must once again be put above inidualism.  This is one of only two statements in the list of 10 that suggests a genuine ideological iding line. Johnson can be touchy on the subject of families because of his own complicated personal life, but mostly he would hesitate before endorsing this because he is genuine libertarian.  Interestingly, though, Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, would sign up to this. Her 2017 manifesto declared: 10) The economy should work for citizens and communities. It is not good enough to just surrender to market forces. This is another line that could have come straight out of the 2017 Tory manifesto. It won’t be in Johnson’s next one because he is more of an enthusiast for market forces. This was illustrated earlier this year when he told a private meeting of Tory MPs: “The reason we have the vaccine success is because of capitalism, because of greed, my friends.” But he was embarrassed by the revelation of his inner Ayn Rand, and as soon as he made the remark, he reportedly tried to withdraw it.According to official figures for July and August:  The Welsh government said there had been “unprecedented levels of demand” and pointed out encouraging news on cancer diagnosis and treatment. It said:  Russell George, a Conservative spokesperson, said: “All the wrong records keep getting broken.”The complainant was second clerk to the home affairs committee, which was chaired by Vaz. This passage refers to the findings of the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, who carried out the original investigation into the complaints. He was responding to a question from Labour’s Rachael Maskell, who represents York Central. She said “the rise in energy prices will disproportionately impact people living in the north because it is colder during the winter in the north” and asked what the government would do to help. In an interview with Kate Ferguson for the Sun, Houchen said that if Johnson wants to repeat his success in “red wall” seats at the next election, the prime minister will have to “supercharge levelling up”. Houchen explained: Houchen, who is highly admired by Johnson, also said that he thought raising national insurance to fund health and social care, in breach of a manifesto promise, was a mistake. He said: From my colleague Rafael Behr last night And here is Rafael’s slightly warmer view this morning.

It’s here, and here is an extract. The independent expert panel, the body that now deals with bullying and harassment complaints against MPs, said in a report (pdf) that between April 2007 and October 2008 Vaz breached the Commons’ bullying and harassment policy in his dealings with the committee’s second clerk. Sir Stephen Irwin, chair of the IEP, said: The IEP sub-panel took on the case, after the facts were investigated by the parliamentary commissioner for standards, to determine what sanction should apply. But Vaz refused to engage with the sub-panel, claiming that he was too ill. The IEP said it did not find this claim convincing.

Video: Kathleen Harris Dr John Dunbar with a noble false widow spider, steatoda nobilis. Although he has handled thousands, Dr Dunbar has never been bitten. Photograph: Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillWe should see plenty of action in an hour, Dr John Dunbar says assuredly via email, excited at the prospect. As a venom expert, many nights are spent combing the walls and railings of Dublin housing estates for Ireland’s highly-poisonous false widow spider.Alone in the dark, armed with extended tweezers and a headlamp, he carefully places each one inside long plastic tubes as the residents sleep inside, blissfully unaware.On a chilly evening thousands of such spiders are scattered just out of sight along Beech Park, a long quiet suburban road in Lucan lined with detached homes and webbed hedges. The noble false widow – or steatoda nobilis – first recorded in Ireland in 1999 is far more common than most people realise and its numbers are increasing alarmingly.Within two minutes Dr Dunbar is poking at a web string. He has spotted two long, thin protruding legs, inconspicuous to the passerby. It is the first trophy of 94 that night.Although he has handled thousands, Dr Dunbar has never been bitten. Twenty bites have been recorded in Ireland, he declares, and the bite is one to be avoided.In some cases victims have experienced severe bacterial infections, debilitating pain and body tremors.Steatoda nobilis is compared to the notorious black widow for a number of reasons including notable similarities in appearance, genetics and toxins. It is known as the “false widow” because in regions where they co-exist it can be difficult to tell them apart.Smaller than the native house spider, chocolate brown with a large bulbous abdomen and an intricate cream pattern sometimes resembling a skull, the false widow is easy to identify.Five or six years ago researchers would have had to look hard for one. Today, a single hunter can expect to bag between 100 and 150 in a few hours in any suburban estate.Thought to have originated in the Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and the Canaries, it arrived in the United Kingdom and Europe on banana boats. Throughout the 20th century it established thriving populations throughout England and Wales, and later colonised parts of western Europe, California, Chile and the Middle East.Although found in Co Wicklow a little more than two decades ago, little was known about its presence here until more recently. A 2017 Royal Irish Academy study confirmed the species in at least 16 counties, but most significantly in the greater Dublin area where it is abundant in urban buildings and around street furniture.As Dr Dunbar walks slowly from suburban home to home, he identifies and scoops up the spiders from virtually every single driveway pillar he examines. His head torch illuminates the undersides of wall ledges, shrubs, gates, guttering, the back of ESB boxes. They are everywhere. After just a short while it seems other native species are relatively difficult to come by.Potent venom“But they do have a venom that’s a little bit more potent than what we’re used to. It’s very similar to the venom of black widows, not quite as potent, but still kind of getting there.”The risk posed are similar to ones posed by bees and wasps. Each spider can give about half of one microlitre of venom, about one thousandth of a millilitre. On his regular hunts Dr Dunbar tells the gardaí he will be prowling. The glow from his headlamp and his intricate inspection of neighbourhood walls are common, as are encounters with neighbours.Just as he is plucking a sample with his extended tweezers, a resident approaches with a fair idea of what is going on but curious all the same. “They are obviously everywhere in this area,” Colm Gallagher says resignedly. “I know what the implications are they have venom and whatever else. But they’re not terribly dangerous.”They do go inside houses, but not usually. Whether for the curious resident, the arachnophobe or the scientist, there is still a lot to learn about these creatures and a race to learn it.“They are here to stay, there is no way we’re going to get rid of them,” he says. “But we really need to monitor them while we can over the next years and see what happens. Now science must tell us what we are dealing with,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Birds still subjected to \u0026lsquopoisoning, persecution, collision or direct disturbance\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Many see the floods as an appropriate, tragic symbol of Merkel’s mixed climate record. Photograph:  Christof Stache   AFP via GettyExactly 100 years ago in Frankfurt, the 30 year-old inventor Max Braun founded an electronics company that conquered the world. With stylish, functional design, Braun radios and electric shavers realised – and commercialised – the lost potential of the Bauhaus design school, founded two years before Braun but suppressed by the Nazis.In 1985 Braun’s chief designer Dieter Rams published a 10-point plan for good design, itself a nod to the 1919 Bauhaus manifesto. Place the Bauhaus and Braun documents side by side, replace “design” with “politics”, and you have the elusive blueprint for the leadership of Angela Merkel, Germany’s “Braunhaus” chancellor. Here we employ Rams’s design principles to help us assess Merkel’s political career.1 Good design is innovativeLiving with Angela Merkel – as a politician for 31 years and writing about her as chancellor for 16 – it’s easy to forget just how unusual and innovative she has been.Merkel\u0026nbspwas the first woman and the first easterner to become German chancellor. When her fourth term ends with the September 26th election, she will be the first postwar German politician to leave office by choice. In an era of social media populism and alpha male nationalism, she has kept her wits, her manners, and her integrity. Her greatest innovation, though, is proving that modern politicians can survive without selling their souls. She sees politics as a handcraft rather than a calling.“She sees what needs to be done and does it it’s all about the work, never her,” says a long-serving senior member of her government. “People devise complex theories about her, perhaps because our times and the challenges we face are so complex, but she’s all about functionality and is not that complex as a person.”2 Good design is as little design as possibleAs a person we know the facts of her life, but little more. Born Angela Kasner in Hamburg in 1954 but raised in East Germany as a Lutheran pastor’s daughter, she excelled at maths and science and went on to study physics and work as a researcher in East Berlin.Even after 16 years in power, her private life remains private: her surname is the only visible trace of her first marriage while her second husband appears at her side only for the annual Wagner festival, earning him the title “Phantom of the Opera”.A self-described political agnostic, Merkel kept her head down during the 1989 peaceful revolution that toppled the Berlin Wall and claims she ended up in public life by fluke. As press spokesperson for a now defunct reform party and then East Germany’s last government, her final boss recommended her to chancellor Helmut Kohl when he sought three easterners for his post-unification cabinet.Asked once what western Germans could learn from easterners like her, she replied: “Patience.”Another “Ossi” (the informal term for a citizen of the former German Democratic Republic) skill she has retained is to allow others speak first, often showing their hand, before she utters a word. I watched her perform that trick at a lunch some years back in the chancellery where, before the main course arrived, she had the handful of journalists at the table talking rather than listening.3 Good design is unobtrusiveMerkel’s maxim is simple: in calm lies power. Behind her calm, mousy exterior, Merkel hid her will for power as she rose through the ranks.More experienced politicians underestimated her low-key style – as an Ossi and a woman – and were unprepared by her first grab for power late in 1999: shafting her scandal-tainted mentor Helmut Kohl and wrong-footing party rivals to snatch the leadership of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU).Her remaining CDU rivals – all western German men – still viewed her as a stop-gap party leader, even as she sidelined them in succession. They have never forgiven her for that, nor have the Social Democrat-Green alpha males she pushed aside for office: chancellor Gerhard Schröder and his foreign minister, Joschka Fischer.From 2005 as chancellor, her unobtrusive camouflage changed: a no-nonsense hairdo a uniform of multicoloured blazers, slacks and flats a rhetorical style that combines sonorous Brandenburg vowels with blank language.German writer Carolin Emcke once studied Merkel’s parliamentary speeches, despairing over how “after three manuscripts you crave Japanese horseradish by the teaspoon just to fight the growing mental paralysis”.“Merkel doesn’t or can’t talk about dreams and visions,” she wrote. “She wants to think in the feasible, not the possible.”4 Good design is authenticMerkel’s greatest political conjuring trick was her 2013 election slogan: “You know me.”Though complete nonsense, the private chancellor’s personality-based pitch worked like a charm: her CDU ended election night just short of an absolute majority on 41.5 per cent. With careful image management and regular private polling – up to three times a week – the childless German leader has reversed engineered and delivered on a deep German need for a maternalistic leadership.“The chancellor exudes a feeling that she will solve all problems somehow,” noted the left-wig Taz newspaper in 2013, “even if no one really knows how.”Her popularity has usually hovered at about 60-70 per cent, never dipping below 41 per cent, thanks to her moderating approach to power in successive grand coalitions, and an iterative “small steps” political style. For her supporters, Germany’s unprecedented economic winning streak in the last 16 years – with only brief crisis dents – is testament to Merkel’s golden touch.Critics point to a very different Merkel who, in 2003, promised a radical overhaul of healthcare, pensions, labour law and wage costs. But she over-estimated German appetite for honesty and, after barely scraping into power in 2005, she dialled down her reform zeal.In a rare moment of public reflection, she admitted in a 2019 speech at Harvard: “As chancellor I often have to ask myself: am I doing the right thing am I doing it because it’s right, or just because it’s possible?”5 Good design is honestMerkel operates in the liminal space between political pragmatism and tactical opportunism. Honesty is often Merkel’s policy but, like Woody Allen, if you don’t like her principles – she has others. At Harvard in 2019, she didn’t protest when introduced as the progressive European politician who brought Germany marriage equality, the minimum wage and the end of nuclear power.The reality is more complicated. It’s true that Merkel decided to drop nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima accident. But, just a year earlier, she halted the nuclear exit plan she inherited from the previous government. In 2015, after years of opposition, she backed a minimum wage proposal from her SPD grand coalition partner – and promptly stole the credit.Merkel pulled a free parliamentary vote on marriage equality out of her hat in 2017 but, reportedly to placate CDU conservatives, voted against it herself in the Bundestag. A former SPD cabinet member compared her political style to a plane trip: “You feel secure and relaxed with her, but you never know where you’re going to land.” Years later, another weary SPD rival added: “Wherever you go politically, when you arrive she’s already there.”Merkel is viewed as so honest and incorruptible that no one can imagine her taking a back-hander. Her predecessors as chancellor both have somewhat tainted legacies: Helmut Kohl accepted illegal political donations Gerhard Schröder took a high-priced consultancy job with Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned energy utility – hardly a corrupt act but certainly an ill-advised one.6 Good design is consequentialWhile the former US president Donald Trump favoured the winner-takes-all Art of the Deal, Merkel has remained authentic to the face-saving compromise and fears it is an endangered species in modern politics.“These days the room for compromise is often no longer easy to find,” she warned in 2019, “and ambiguity is not much appreciated.”Despite her skill as a political chameleon, as chancellor she has remained consequential on a three core principles: the security of Israel\u0026nbspGerman and EU integration in the multilateral order\u0026nbspand the transatlantic relationship. The latter has always been her biggest priority, say close Merkel watchers.In 2009, the otherwise sober chancellor told the US congress how, during her first 35 years growing up in East Germany, she remained “passionate” about the US defence of freedom and civil rights it represented for her, “even though until 1989 America was simply out of reach for me”.This was all in her head, Merkel officials say, when she offered cool congratulations to Trump on his 2016 presidential victory. She offered the German-American president a “close co-operation” on what she called shared US-German values: respect for democracy, freedom, the rule of law and human dignity.7 Good design is understandableThis is where Germany’s Braunhaus chancellor begins to struggle. Since her schooldays, paralysed on the ing board, Merkel remembers having a deep fear of making the wrong decision. Her opaque decision-making process and modest rhetorical ability, meanwhile, often limit her ability to get others behind any decisions she finally makes.In the euro crisis, faced with huge opposition at home to bailing out Ireland and other crisis countries, Merkel only agreed after securing swingeing austerity and reform measures in return. Fury elsewhere at the measures’ social cost was drowned out in Germany’s emotive debate about the supposed cost and risk – none of which came to pass.Trapped between warnings of a German diktat abroad and howls of bailout betrayal at home, Merkel’s eurocrisis response was her belated, imperfect attempt to escape a high-risk Catch-22 situation and shatter the EU.“She always did enough to keep the EU show on the road,” said Prof Brigid Laffan, director of the Robert Schuman Centre at Florence’s European University Institute. “She kept Greece in the euro zone when finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble decided that it would survive a Grexit.”Merkel’s belated embrace of bailouts – as “alternativlos”, or without alternative, to save the euro – came at a cost. It opened the door, and was name-giver to, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which soared to new heights in the 2015 refugee crisis.This exposed the limits of Merkel’s ability to make politics understandable. Her decision to keep open Germany’s borders and accept one million people was applauded – but not matched – by most EU neighbours, and a morally questionable treaty with Turkey followed to keep refugees out of Europe.Her crisis responses have compounded disorientation and anger among more conservative CDU members, already at odds with the Merkel-era push to the political centre. For them, agreeing to let the European Commission issue debt to finance the EU pandemic recovery fund – cheered elsewhere as proof of Merkel’s European calling – was the final betrayal.Mixed feelings remain on her Brexit response. Merkel was frustrated at not being more involved, but her aides say British politicians and journalists made two key miscalculations.“They underestimated how much higher she valued holding the EU together than keeping the UK,” said a government official, “and they believed – wrongly – that she would eventually yield to the lobbying of Germany manufacturers.”One final shadow, Prof Laffan suggests, is how Merkel and her CDU have been “far too tolerant” of the pushback by Hungary and Poland against EU rule-of-law standards: “I think this is an area where her legacy is less benign.8 Good design is long-lastingThis is where the Braunhaus chancellor blueprint begins to get blurry, with even admirers ambivalent over what will remain of Merkel when she departs. What’s clear is that, on her watch, Germany emerged – economically and politically – as the first among equals in the EU.“And it’s testament to her skill that this has come about without ending in enmity,” says Stefan Kornelius, a Merkel biographer. “In an unprecedented series of crises she has held Europe together with Germany at its heart. That is her big strategic achievement.”With her stable longevity she has quietly repositioned Germany on the international stage: staying out of the 2013 military intervention in Libya and the chaotic aftermath staying the distance in Afghanistan, with Germany second only to the US in troop numbers taking the lead in the Russia-Ukraine stand-off after the Crimea annexation to avoid outright war in Europe.For all their public praise, though, allies in Washington, Paris and elsewhere struggle to get clear positions from the Merkel administration on the future of the EU, and its stance on Russia and China – leaving unanswered questions for the post-Merkel era.For all her global crisis management, at home\u0026nbspthe longevity of her legacy hinges on the (in)competence of her successor and the sizeable reform backlog Merkel has left behind: healthcare, tax, pensions, creaking public administration and infrastructure, and a mobile phone network worse than Bulgaria’s.9 Good design is eco-friendlyMerkel has cut a lonely figure as she visited towns ravaged by last week’s floods, haunted by her younger political self. As German environment minister in 1995, at the first UN climate conference in Bonn, Merkel pushed through the Kyoto Protocol and binding climate goals, arguing that greenhouse gases “have to be reduced as quickly as possible”.Flash forward to April 2021, when Germany’s federal constitutional court threw out a recent Merkel climate plan as too vague, shifting too much of the burden on to younger generations.As “climate chancellor”, she has pushed Germany’s renewable energy share from 10 to 40 per cent, but the “Energiewende” or energy transition is a wobbly work-in progress. And Merkel has lobbied hard for the other side, too: intervening during Ireland’s 2013 presidency to water down rules on exhaust emissions she feared would hobble Germany’s car industry.Given all this, many see the floods as an appropriate, tragic symbol of Merkel’s mixed climate record.Dr Claudia Kemfert, a leading energy analyst, says: “I wouldn’t be surprised if, after her chancellorship, she does everything she can to advocate active climate protection behind the scenes.”10 In good design, form follows functionIn her otherwise spartan office, Merkel keeps a portrait of Catherine the Great, the Prussian-born Russian empress. In the past 16 years, she has internalised Catherine’s conviction that a capable political ruler is “guided by circumstances, conjectures and conjunctions”.She worked to build up political capital with voters, argues biographer Stefan Kornelius, then deployed it carefully when needed – in the euro, refugee and pandemic crises – to hold Germany, and Europe, together.“Merkel always knew how far to go without endangering her power, that’s how you hold on to power for 16 years,” he adds.After three decades and countless glasses of red wine together, film-maker Volker Schlöndorff jokes that the secret about Merkel is that there is none.“She is no sphinx, there is no mystery behind what meets the eye,” he said. Pressed on her legacy, he adds: “She reconciled Germany with itself. We are just normal people after all – though she is not.”On Thursday in Berlin, at her 29th and final summer press conference, Germany’s rational Braunhaus chancellor knocked back stoically every sentimental softball question lobbed her way.“It’s up to others to draw a balance, and they will do that,” she said. “I’m at ease with myself, with my life and my biography. I think both gave me good opportunities to make a contribution to Germany’s political life.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"germany s federal election the parties polls coalitions and how it all works","story":"Some 60.4 million Germans are called to elect a new government on September 26th and all polls suggest it will be a tight race.Chancellor Angela Merkel is standing down after four terms and her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is struggling without her. The centre-right party is in second place, trailing by 3-5 percentage points. Recent polls show it closing the lead with the front-runner, the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).With the outcome impossible to predict, the only certainty is that, given ongoing fragmentation of the political landscape, Germany is likely to get its first three-party coalition. Here are the main parties up for election, and their post-election options:Christian Democratic Union (CDU)-Christian Social Union (CSU)The CDU is a centre-right party that lives to rule – governing in Bonn, then Berlin, for all but 20 years since 1949. It has given Germany chancellors such as Konrad Adenauer, postwar West Germany’s founding father, and Helmut Kohl, chancellor of German unity. In 2018, Angela Merkel stood down as party leader after 18 years. Armin Laschet, the party’s second leader since then, was nominated lead candidate in April and, after a brief surge, has been on a downhill run ever since. A lack of political focus and a series of gaffes – in particular being caught on camera laughing in a flood-devastated town – have undermined his credibility. In the election – and in parliament – the CDU forms a centre-right “union” with the CSU, which only runs in Bavaria and has ruled the state almost uninterrupted since 1949.Social Democratic Party (SPD)The centre-left SPD is Germany’s oldest party, founded in 1863. After legendary chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt, it returned to power with Gerhard Schröder for seven years until 2005. Internal pushback at economic and social reforms split the party and saw it lose the chancellery. In the years since it has served three times as junior partner in a grand coalition with the CDU, complicating party efforts to reconcile itself with the Schröder-era reforms. After years of infighting, the party’s leftist and centrist wings have united around Olaf Scholz, outgoing finance minister and a centrist politician presenting a leftist programme.Free Democratic Party (FPD)Germany’s pro-business liberals are likely to be kingmakers after the election, a role they played for decades in postwar politics, alternately with the CDU and SPD, and most recently with Merkel for four years until 2017. Traditionally the party of free market economics and  civil rights, the FDP has struggled to maintain its profile under a series of strong-willed leaders. The latest, Christian Lindner, pulled out of coalition talks with the CDU and Greens in 2017, insisting it was “better not to govern than to govern badly”. The FDP’s strident criticism of pandemic restrictions rebuilt credibility and trust with its traditional business base.GreensAfter an early surge in polls to first place, the Greens have slumped somewhat but, in all likelihood, are heading back to power for the first time since 2005. Their lead candidate Annalena Baerbock has regained momentum after early campaign gaffes. But aged just 40, and with no executive experience, many Germans fear she is not a political heavyweight. After years with a reputation as the “ban” party, the Greens have reframed their green message in a more positive light. They hope recent devastating floods in western German will concentrate voter minds on the need for a climate component to the next coalition.Alternative für Deutschland (AfD)Born in the euro crisis as an anti-bailout protest party, the AfD gained ground during the 2015-2016 refugee crisis. Four years ago it entered the Bundestag for the first time as the largest opposition party, promising to “hunt down” the Merkel administration. Its political offering runs the gamut from right-wing conservatism to far-right nationalism, stridently xenophobic and with climate and Covid-19 scepticism in the mix. The party is wracked by infighting and has struggled in polls to reach its previous election result, but hopes for a strong result in eastern regions.Die Linke (The Left)Germany’s hard-left party proposes a radical shift in domestic and foreign policy. It is the political successor to East Germany’s ruling communist party (SED), supplemented by SPD members who broke away in protest at Schröder-era reforms. Effectively it is two parties: a more pragmatic wing in eastern Germany, with considerable state government experience, and a western German fundamentalist wing. Its election demands include a higher minimum wage, pensions and welfare payments, largely financed by a wealth tax. Its foreign policy demands – in particular replacing Nato with a global security system including Russia – are likely to place it at the fringes of any post-election coalition talks.“Jamaica”: CDUCSU-Green-FDPThis coalition, named after the island nation, is the most likely option if the (black) CDU finishes first. It almost came about in 2017 until the FDP walked out of advanced coalition talks. Unlike the traffic light, this coalition would put the Greens on the back foot with their climate ambitions. But CDU leader Laschet has signalled his desire for a far-reaching political investment that allows German companies make a “green leap” and become leaders in sustainable, transformative climate-friendly business and technology. Tax relief to lower earners would be likely, but hikes for the rich would be off the table.“Kenya” (CDUCSU-SPD-Green)Arithmetically a possibility, if CDU and SPD fall below a majority. This would add the Greens to the existing grand coalition, pushing climate policy and giving momentum to the SPD’s social justice platform.Grand coalition (CDUCSU-SPD)The coalition option that dare not speak its name. After three such governments since 2005, no one in Berlin wants another. But never say never . . .ELECTORAL SYSTEM -\u0026nbspGermany has 299 constituencies and a proportional system that gives each voter two votes: one for a party list, another for a direct, local candidate. The Bundestag has 598 seats with half (299) reserved for list candidates, the other half for direct candidates.If the party gets more direct candidates in a constituency than it is entitled to (linked to its share of the list vote), the direct MPs take their seat anyway in addition to the 299 direct MP allocation. This creates additional seats and has swollen successive parliaments – 709 in the outgoing Bundestag.Repeated attempts to correct the phenomenon have failed and this incoming parliament is forecast to have well over 800 – possibly even 900 – seats. That would make it the world’s biggest parliament – after China.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"wuhan scientists planned releaseskin penetrating nanoparticles","story":"Wuhan and US scientists were planning to release enhanced airborne coronavirus particles into Chinese bat populations to inoculate them against diseases that could jump to humans, leaked grant proposals dating from 2018 show.New documents show that just 18 months before the first Covid-19 cases appeared, researchers had submitted plans to release skin-penetrating nanoparticles and aerosols containing “novel chimeric spike proteins” of bat coronaviruses into cave bats in Yunnan, China.They also planned to create chimeric viruses, genetically enhanced to infect humans more easily, and requested $14million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) to fund the work.Papers, confirmed as genuine by a former member of the Trump administration, show they were hoping to introduce “human-specific cleavage sites” to bat coronaviruses which would make it easier for the virus to enter human cells. When Covid-19 was first genetically sequenced, scientists were puzzled about how the virus had evolved such a human-specific adaptation at the cleavage site on the spike protein, which is the reason it is so infectious.The documents were released by Drastic, the web-based investigations team set up by scientists from across the world to look into the origins of Covid-19.In a statement, Drastic said: “Given that we find in this proposal a discussion of the planned introduction of human-specific cleavage sites, a review by the wider scientific community of the plausibility of artificial insertion is warranted.”The proposal also included plans to mix high-risk natural coronavirus strains with more infectious but less dangerous varieties.The bid was submitted by British zoologist Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance, the US-based organisation, which has worked closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) researching bat coronaviruses. Team members included Dr Shi Zhengli, the WIV researcher dubbed “bat woman”, pictured below, as well as US researchers from the University of North Carolina and the United States Geological Survey National Wildlife Health Centre.Darpa refused to fund the work, saying: “It is clear that the proposed project led by Peter Daszak could have put local communities at risk”, and warned that the team had not properly considered the dangers of enhancing the virus (gain of function research) or releasing a vaccine by air.Grant documents show that the team also had some concerns about the vaccine programme and said they would “conduct educational outreach … so that there is a public understanding of what we are doing and why we are doing it, particularly because of the practice of bat-consumption in the region”.Angus Dalgleish, Professor of Oncology at St Georges, University of London, who struggled to get work published showing that the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) had been carrying out “gain of function” work for years before the pandemic, said the research may have gone ahead even without the funding.“This is clearly a gain of function, engineering the cleavage site and polishing the new viruses to enhance human cell infectibility in more than one cell line,” he said. Daszak was also behind a letter published in The Lancet last year which effectively shut down scientific debate into the origins of Covid-19.Viscount Ridley, who has co-authored a book on the origin of Covid-19, due for release in November, and who has frequently called for a further investigation into what caused the pandemic in the House of Lords, said: “For more than a year I tried repeatedly to ask questions of Peter Daszak with no response.“Now it turns out he had authored this vital piece of information about virus work in Wuhan but refused to share it with the world. I am furious. So should the world be. “Peter Daszak and the EcoHealth Alliance (EHA) proposed injecting deadly chimeric bat coronaviruses collected by the Wuhan Institute of Virology into humanised and ‘batified’ mice, and much, much more.”A Covid-19 researcher from the World Health Organisation (WHO), who wished to remain anonymous, said it was alarming that the grant proposal included plans to enhance the more deadly disease of Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers).“The scary part is they were making infectious chimeric Mers viruses,” the source said. “These viruses have a fatality rate over 30 per cent, which is at least an order of magnitude more deadly than Sars-CoV-2.“If one of their receptor replacements made Mers spread similarly, while maintaining its lethality, this pandemic would be nearly apocalyptic.”EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan Institute of Virology have been aproached for comment.More from NewsAfghan women \u0026#39feel forced to marry just to leave the house\u0026#39 despite Taliban promisesDuke and Duchess of Sussex hit New York in first tour of their post-royal eraBusiness Secretary \u0026#39categorically\u0026#39 rules out grants or subsidies to larger energy firmsMale life expectancy drops for first time in 40 years as Covid pandemic takes tollAngry villagers’ legs left dangling after firm installs bus shelter seats ‘made for giants’\u0026#39No one is safe\u0026#39 from cancel culture, warns Johnny DeppMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"biden macron vandalising liberal order claim love","story":"Why is the global Left so bad at choosing its heroes? Joe Biden was meant to be the anti-Trump, the saviour of Western multilateralism Emmanuel Macron was the poster boy for European centrism, the brilliant reformer who would rescue the continent from descent into populist turmoil. Yet both men have turned out to be calamitously bad, accelerating the disintegration of the West.It may not look like it at first, but Biden, America’s oldest president, and Macron, France’s youngest head of state since Napoleon Bonaparte, have much in common. They clashed in extraordinary fashion last week, with France withdrawing its ambassador over the Aukus pact, but this was a classic case of Coulomb’s Law: like charges repel one another.Both men are overrated accidental presidents who rose to the top because they were seen as the least terrible option both fancy themselves as great technocratic administrators, but are actually shockingly incompetent, as shown by the withdrawal from Afghanistan or France’s endless botched reforms both are hypocritical semi-nationalists who believe in their own nation’s power and sovereignty but not anybody else’s and both are presiding over the accelerating economic, social and moral declines of their countries.Perhaps most unfortunately, both are anti-British: they share a dislike of this country, or at least are ready to bash the UK for domestic political gain. Biden’s aversion stems in part from his support for Irish nationalism, and his typically American misunderstanding of the history and politics of the British Isles. His State Department also still loathes and misunderstands Brexit.Macron sees himself as a latter-day Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French who never forgave Britain for harbouring him and allowing him to liberate Paris. Being served hand and foot at the Élysée Palace does tend to turn presidents into megalomaniacs, but the effect on Macron has been especially toxic. More prosaically, bashing Britain helps him in the polls and, he hopes, dissuades Eastern Europeans from leaving the EU.His attitude towards Britain since 2017 has been unforgivable. He spent the Brexit negotiations pushing the hardest possible position, deliberately seeking to undermine the City, helping to rule out a fuller, proper free trade deal that respected regulatory autonomy, and leveraging what should have been a resolvable technical question over the Irish border to permanently damage the UK. He later threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey, and wrongly cast aspersions on the AstraZeneca vaccine. His government has now hit fresh lows, dismissing Britain as America’s junior partner, and describing Boris Johnson as the “fifth wheel on the carriage”.Macron is treating Britain as an enemy to be contained, not a partner with which to navigate a treacherous world. Why? In a more rational and more truly Gaullist world, Brexit could have been accepted and followed by an Anglo-French partnership of equals, a new entente cordiale on matters of mutual interest. Instead, Macron’s miscalculations will guarantee more Australia-style rebuffs and an even faster fading of French influence. What a terrible, heart-wrenching waste.Biden’s behaviour has been just as appalling. He no longer has any genuine allies: he sees other countries merely as a means to execute American self-interest, as useful instruments in his foreign policy. There is no respect, let alone friendship or gratitude. Other denizens of the White House at least had the sense to pretend to care some, such as Ronald Reagan or George Bush, actually did, at least some of the time.While the French got their just deserts on the Aukus deal – their support of Australia was far inferior to the US-UK offer – the secretive, undiplomatic way Biden behaved was unbecoming. On such grounds at least, Macron was right to be annoyed, though his petulance was ludicrous.Biden’s treatment of Britain is especially egregious. If the Democrats now believe in free trade, they should be pining to reduce trade barriers towards the UK. Why, then, is a trade deal with the US impossible? Why couldn’t a narrow set of arrangements acceptable to both sides be realised? Or why couldn’t Biden invite us to join USMCA, the successor organisation to Nafta, a proposal mooted in Eurosceptic and Republican circles for as long as I can remember?Why seek to “punish” us (and, given that free trade is mutually advantageous, American consumers and business) for being a faithful ally to the US? Why endlessly misrepresent the Good Friday agreement? Why reduce the chance of peace in Northern Ireland? As with Macron, this is not the way to treat friends.The French president’s fury over Aukus will intensify his drive towards a European army, and an integrated EU foreign policy. This cannot end well.It makes sense for the world no longer to follow America blindly: almost all of Washington’s foreign policy decisions since the end of the Cold War have failed disastrously. But when the French talk of pursuing their own path, they refer at best to idioctic semi-colonial adventures in Africa, or at worst to being more supportive of just about every authoritarian regime.It was the French who sold the Osirak nuclear reactor to Iraq, who were most enthusiastic in signing deals with Iran after the ill-fated nuclear deal was inked, and Macron who secured a major deal for Airbus with the Chinese in 2019 in the wake of Sino-US tensions. France remains a Colbertiste nation, obsessed with mercantilism its statist economic policy at home guarantees stagnation, so deals with despots are its only hope. An integrated Franco-German foreign policy would be even worse – sucking up to Russia as well as China.The dream of European strategic autonomy – a European defence no longer reliant on America – will lead to disaster. Nobody wants to spend the cash, not least the semi-pacifist Germans. It will finish off Nato, and tear the EU apart. Who in Eastern Europe would trust a Paris-Berlin axis over Washington for their defence?The Left hailed Macron and Biden as the saviours of the liberal international order but both men have already done more to trash it than anything Donald Trump ever concocted.More from NewsAfghan women \u0026#39feel forced to marry just to leave the house\u0026#39 despite Taliban promisesDuke and Duchess of Sussex hit New York in first tour of their post-royal eraBusiness Secretary \u0026#39categorically\u0026#39 rules out grants or subsidies to larger energy firmsMale life expectancy drops for first time in 40 years as Covid pandemic takes tollAngry villagers’ legs left dangling after firm installs bus shelter seats ‘made for giants’\u0026#39No one is safe\u0026#39 from cancel culture, warns Johnny DeppMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"europe wrapped around putins little finger","story":"If Vladimir Putin has one defining characteristic, it is his pathological intolerance of those who seek to oppose his relentless quest for power and influence. Russian voters will hardly have been surprised that the president’s United Russia party emerged victorious from the ballot last weekend, winning two thirds of the 450 seats in the country’s parliament. The contest, as is so often the case, was marred by reports of ballot boxes being stuffed with false slips as well as forced voting, while leading opposition candidates were banned from standing or, in the case of the prominent Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, confined to a prison cell.Mr Putin’s obsessive pursuit of his adversaries, moreover, extends well beyond Russian borders, as demonstrated by the conclusions reached this week by two decisions relating to Kremlin-inspired attacks on Russian dissidents based in Britain.A ruling issued by the European Court of Human Rights concluded that Moscow was responsible for the murder in 2006 of Alexander Litvinenko, the dissident former Russian intelligence agent who died after drinking tea laced with polonium-210 at a London hotel. The court concluded there was a prima facie case that the murder was carried out by two Russian agents who “had been acting on the direction or control of the Russian authorities”.The judgment coincided with British counter-terrorism police charging a third Russian intelligence officer, Maj Gen Denis Sergeev, with involvement in the attempted murder of the former Russian spy Col Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in March 2018. The existence of a third Russian intelligence officer – first revealed by The Daily  – who oversaw the plot to murder Mr Skripal with the nerve agent Novichok highlighted the sophistication of the assassination attempt by Russia’s GRU intelligence operation to silence one of Mr Putin’s fiercest critics.Mr Putin’s well-documented history of tyrannical behaviour during his two decades in power has made it abundantly clear that he is singularly unsuited to hold any position that affords him any form of global responsibility. Yet, thanks to the increasing influence Moscow is able to exert over Europe’s energy market, he now finds himself able to hold his European neighbours to ransom over their energy requirements.Mr Putin may argue that he is not entirely to blame for the recent dramatic increases in global gas prices, which will result in households throughout Europe – especially Britain – facing higher energy bills this winter. A combination of factors, such as a sharp post-pandemic rise in demand in Asia, low gas storage stocks and a reduction in output from renewables such as wind, have certainly contributed to the astonishing 280 per cent increase in wholesale gas prices in Europe so far this year.Yet, as the International Energy Agency (IEA) made clear this week, the Kremlin is also contributing to Europe’s deepening fuel crisis by slowing down its normal flow of gas supplies to mainland Europe, with storage levels lower than normal heading into the winter months.In a rare public rebuke, the IEA pointed out that Russian exports to Europe were lower than in 2019, and called on Moscow to “demonstrate its credentials as a reliable supplier” and “do more to increase gas availability to Europe”.It is unlikely that assisting Europe in its hour of need will feature prominently in Mr Putin’s priorities as he assesses the potentially devastating impact that the energy crisis could have on Britain and the European Union’s economic recovery from the pandemic. Instead, the indications suggest that the Kremlin has been deliberately planning for just such an eventuality.Concerns about Mr Putin’s attempts to exert undue influence over the rest of Europe have been steadily growing since construction began five years ago on the £8 billion Nord Stream 2 subsea pipeline that runs from the Baltic to Germany. The project, which was completed this month, has been the focus of great controversy over claims it will further increase European dependence on Russian energy, which already accounts for about one third of its requirements. The project is also seen as a deliberate ploy by the Kremlin to isolate Ukraine, which is set to lose out on billions of dollars in gas transit fees.Washington has long regarded the Nord Stream 2 project as a blatant attempt by Moscow to establish a controlling interest over Europe’s energy needs, one that, once established, can be exploited to ransom European capitals into acceding to Moscow’s demands.These concerns have finally persuaded the EU to take a more sober assessment of Mr Putin’s motives in developing Nord Stream 2, which has created hesitancy in Brussels about giving its approval to the new pipeline. The problem Europe now faces is that, as the crisis over gas prices has highlighted, European leaders have woken up too late to the insidious threat Mr Putin poses to Europe’s energy needs.More from NewsAfghan women \u0026#39feel forced to marry just to leave the house\u0026#39 despite Taliban promisesDuke and Duchess of Sussex hit New York in first tour of their post-royal eraBusiness Secretary \u0026#39categorically\u0026#39 rules out grants or subsidies to larger energy firmsMale life expectancy drops for first time in 40 years as Covid pandemic takes tollAngry villagers’ legs left dangling after firm installs bus shelter seats ‘made for giants’\u0026#39No one is safe\u0026#39 from cancel culture, warns Johnny DeppMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"male life expectancy drops first time 40 years covid pandemic","story":"Male life expectancy in the UK has fallen for the first time in 40 years as a result of the Covid pandemic, official figures show.On Thursday, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published its annual report on life expectancy, which takes an average of the last three years to account for anomalies such as a particularly bad flu season.It shows that 2020 was by far the deadliest year in more than a century – meaning that even when figures for 2018 and 2019 are included, life expectancy has been negatively affected.A boy born in this three-year  would live, on average, 79.04 years – seven weeks less than the figure for the previous three-year  of 2015 to 2017.The ONS began compiling life expectancy data in 1980. During the first-ever window, between 1980 and 1982, expectancy was 70.8 for men and 76.8 for women, and has risen consistently since then.The reversal of a four-decade trend is due to men being hit hardest by the Covid pandemic, experts believe. ONS data show that 55.6 per cent of all Covid fatalities in England and Wales last year were men.For women, life expectancy remained stable compared to the 2015-2017 window, increasing by half a week to 82.9 years.England had the highest life expectancy of all four nations in the UK, at 79.3 for men and 83.1 for women. Scotland had the lowest, with men living 76.8 years on average and women 81 years.Pamela Cobb, of the ONS, said: Life expectancy has increased in the UK over the last 40 years, albeit at a slower pace in the last decade. However, the coronavirus pandemic led to a greater number of deaths than normal in 2020.Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at The Open University, said: Life expectancy at birth, as shown in these figures, sounds as if it\u0027s how long people might expect to live or how long people do live on average.But it isn’t that at all – it\u0027s the average length of time an imaginary group of people would live if they were born in 2018-2020, and afterwards, at every age, experienced the same risk of dying as happened to people in the UK in 2018-2020.It’s pretty well impossible that the risk of dying at every age, for people born in 2018-2020, will really remain at the 2018-2020 levels for the rest of their lives, so these figures don\u0027t represent how long people born then will actually live.More from NewsAfghan women \u0026#39feel forced to marry just to leave the house\u0026#39 despite Taliban promisesDuke and Duchess of Sussex hit New York in first tour of their post-royal eraBusiness Secretary \u0026#39categorically\u0026#39 rules out grants or subsidies to larger energy firmsAngry villagers’ legs left dangling after firm installs bus shelter seats ‘made for giants’\u0026#39No one is safe\u0026#39 from cancel culture, warns Johnny DeppCut VAT on energy bills as ‘Conservative solution’ to cost of living crisis, Government toldMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public has gone along government told going green wont cost","story":"Boris Johnson has always been a man of flexible views, able to transform his political philosophy at the flick of a switch according to whom he is trying to impress. His speech to the UN – from a man who once scorned wind farms and told us sun spots would cool the Earth – is merely an especially breathtaking example. Behind his conversion to a mop-haired Greta Thurnberg, of course, lies a cold calculation. He has reckoned that the British public is concerned about climate change, wants something done about it, and that his chief political weapon – his ability to find popularity with people well beyond the limits of traditional Tory voters – is best-served by leaping on the climate bandwagon.But there is a danger to this, and one which – thanks to the current energy crisis - looks like becoming apparent sooner rather than later. On climate, the British public demonstrates the same fickleness as the Prime Minister himself. Save the planet? Save polar bears? Slash carbon emissions to zero? People will back you all the way. But accept a diminution in living standards in order to achieve that latter aim? That’s a very different matter. A YouGov poll from March sounds the warning: while two thirds agreed that climate change was an urgent problem, only 11 per cent were prepared to pay more for their domestic heating, and the same percentage wanted to see gas boilers banned.It appears to be Johnson’s belief that reaching zero carbon emissions won’t cost us a jot. He sees miracle technologies which are somehow going to slash our emissions and enrich us at the same time. Well maybe, but then again maybe not.To achieve net zero will require not just one technology to be invented and proven at scale but a multitude of them. To believe that energy bills won’t rise is foolish. To take but one example, the government is proposing that our gas boilers be replaced with hydrogen boilers. Yet hydrogen has to be manufactured, and the way the government intends to do it, at least initially, is via ‘blue’ hydrogen – made from natural gas, with the carbon dioxide extracted during the process and buried underground. However much faith you might have in the inventiveness of humans it stands to reason that it cannot possibly be cheaper to manufacture a fuel from natural gas than it is simply to burn the gas itself. The government’s current hydrogen strategy must, by definition, raise prices.Johnson’s green policies have had an easy ride so far, but with the spike in global wholesale gas prices threatening to land homeowners with huge rises in bills they are about to face a very stern popularity test -- and just as the world’s great and good arrives in Glasgow for COP26. Much as business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng might try to argue that the current crisis reinforces the need to become less reliant on fossil fuels, it isn’t going to cut much ice with the shivering masses this winter. Fact is that a decade ago, when coal still accounted for a third of power generation, we would have suffered less from a spike in gas prices than we have done this year. Now, coal is all but gone and we are trying to rely on increasing quantities of wind power instead. But, until the last couple of days, the wind wasn’t blowing and we still have no means of storing large quantities of wind-generated electricity from one week to the next. Mass power storage is yet one more technology we are going to have master if we are to reach net zero without imposing massive costs on consumers.This week has given us a taste of the price shocks which lie in store as the government ploughs on with trying to reach the legally-binding target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 which it has unilaterally imposed upon itself. Much as the British public loves bunnies and hedgehogs, it is not going to be impressed if it is left shivering while other countries which have not tied their arms behind their backs in such a way are able to continue to enjoy affordable energy.More from NewsAfghan women \u0026#39feel forced to marry just to leave the house\u0026#39 despite Taliban promisesDuke and Duchess of Sussex hit New York in first tour of their post-royal eraBusiness Secretary \u0026#39categorically\u0026#39 rules out grants or subsidies to larger energy firmsMale life expectancy drops for first time in 40 years as Covid pandemic takes tollAngry villagers’ legs left dangling after firm installs bus shelter seats ‘made for giants’\u0026#39No one is safe\u0026#39 from cancel culture, warns Johnny DeppMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela rayner blasts raab over","story":":root Angela Rayner blasts Raab over luxury holiday thatd cost poor Brits  days workThe Labour Deputy Leader quipped the Deputy PM should “go back to his sun lounger and let me take over”this.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video angela-rayner-challenges-dominic-raab-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:Undcxmu,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

The Justice Secretary, who was standing in for Boris Johnson at Prime Ministeraposs Questions, was sacked as Foreign Secretary last week over his handling of the Afghanistan crisis.It followed widespread outrage for him staying at the plush Amirandes Hotel in Crete to top up his tan while the Taliban took Kabul. Ms Rayner took him to task over the cost of his stay, telling him ministers told Brits to work harder while hitting the pockets of working families by “cutting the income of a worker on £, a year by over £,” with tax rises. She said: “That is almost exactly the same as an average annual energy bill. Just as energy prices are ballooning they have chosen to take the money that could cover a year’s worth of bills out of the pockets of working people.  “The Deputy Prime Minister has said the solution is for people to work harder. So, can he tell us how many days a worker on the minimum wage would have to work this year in order to afford a night at a luxury hotel, say in Crete ” Mr Raab replied the Government had previously cut income tax for the lowest paid and have boosted the minimum wage, but he was unable to answer her question about his plush sunshine break. Ms Rayner hit back, saying: “He talks about the economy, he doesn’t even know how much his own holiday cost. “So let me tell him. A worker on the minimum wage would need to work an extra  days to pay for a single night at his favourite resort, probably even morethe sea was open. The very same week that the Government is cutting Universal Credit, working people face soaring energy bills.” Keir Starmeraposs deputy then shamed the Justice Secretary over reports he is unhappy at having to share the grace and favour Chevening mansion with his successor as Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss.  The huge country residence is paid for by a charity, but is provided to Government ministers for no cost to them. Ms Rayner said the Conservatives do “not care about working people” before adding: “Families across the country are worried about heating their homes while he’s complaining about having to share his -room taxpayer-funded mansion with the Foreign Secretary – the truth hurts, doesn’t it  – just as his Government are making choices that are making working families’ lives harder. “A typical family is facing a tough winter this year: Universal Credit down a thousand quid rent up  quid gas bills up  quid taxes up and food prices are soaring. Working people will have to choose whether to feed their kids or heat their homes. “The choice for the Deputy Prime Minister is will he make their lives easier or harder  So what will he choose – will the Government cancel the Universal Credit cut ” Mr Raab replied: “She should check her facts as Chevening is funded by a charity, not a penny of taxpayers’ money.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Energy billsFuel povertyMinimum wageThe economyPMQs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Professor Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, said the country is over the worst and things should be fine once winter has passed - adding there was continued exposure to the virus even in people who are vaccinated.It came after Professor Dame Sarah Gilbert told a Royal Society of Medicine webinar that viruses tend to become weaker as they spread around.She said: We normally see that viruses become less virulent as they circulate more easily and there is no reason to think we will have a more virulent version of Sars-CoV-.“We tend to see slow genetic drt of the virus and there will be gradual immunity developing in the population as there is to all the other seasonal coronaviruses. Seasonal coronaviruses cause colds, and Dame Sarah said: Eventually Sars-CoV- will become one of those.Asked about the comments, Sir John told Times Radio: If you look at the trajectory weaposre on, weaposre a lot better off than we were six months ago.“The pressure on the NHS is largely abated. If you look at the deaths from Covid, they tend to be very elderly people, and itaposs not entirely clear it was Covid that caused all those deaths, so I think weaposre over the worst of it now. “I think what will happen is, there will be quite a lot of background exposure to Delta , we can see the case numbers are quite high, that particularly in people whoaposve had two vaccinesthey get a bit of breakthrough symptomatology, or not even symptomatology -they just are asymptomatically infected, that will add to our immunity substantially, so I think weaposre headed for the position Sarah describes probably by next spring would be my view.“We have to get over the winter to get there but I think it should be fine. Dame Sarahaposs comments were also echoed by Professor David Matthews, Professor of Virology at Bristolaposs School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine. He told the Mirror: Babies born today will probably catch it, bat it away, and by the time theyaposre   -years-old theyaposll have fought the virus and won dozens of times. This virus is probably not a killer in that it doesnapost kill babies, where as things like flu do. It will settle down to just a common cold.  It comes as it emerged Englandaposs confirmed Covid cases fell % in the week to September , hitting the lowest level since June, despite schools going back. Some , people tested positive at least once for the virus in the seven-day period, a level not seen since the , cases recorded in the week to June . The sudden drop in NHS Test and Trace figures could be driven partly by a % fall in testing, but not completely. But Sir John also warned that, while Covid vaccines worked to prevent serious illness and death, they donapost really effectively reduce the amount of transmission. This was the reason why in Israel the reality is transmission in schools have gone way up and transmissions after holidays have gone way up. Sir John added: If everybodyaposs expecting the vaccines and the boosters to stop that, they wonapost. And itaposs slightly a  promise. He said he agreed with Englandaposs chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, that the vast majority of children would get Covid without a vaccine, adding this is now an endemic virus, itaposll circulate pretty widely.  Prof Whitty warned this week that quite a lot of damage could still occur over the winter months. Speaking as the jab was rolled out to  to -year-olds, he told MPs: Letaposs make an assumption that the great majority of children whoaposve not currently had Covid- are going to get it at some point over the next period. It wonapost be necessarily in the next two or three months but they will get it sooner or later. But addressing the Commons education committee, Prof Whitty added: Vaccination will reduce that risk. Sir John said there are no bad consequences in children with the virus, adding that I donapost think thereaposs any reason to panic. He continued: I donapost think weaposre going to have a lot of children in intensive care units. And in fact, the evidence is we donapost, we never have. And the likelihood of severe diseasequite small. Sir John said he believed the issue of long Covid has been slightly overblown, adding that proper epidemiological studies find the incidence of long Covid is much lower than people had anticipated. Englandaposs chief medical officer was facing questions from MPs about the inclusion of children in the Governmentaposs Covid- vaccination programme. When asked what proportion of children had already had Covid-, he replied: It ies by age and it does also y by setting, but I thinkwe go for roughly half I think that is a reasonable stab at this.  Thataposs half over the period of the entire epidemic to date, and weaposve got quite a way to run. Weaposre running into winter so thereaposs still quite a lot of damage that could be done in terms of disruption. Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam added that because the Delta iant is so infectious we are not looking at a theoretical risk of children aged  to  becoming infected. He said: I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point.  Elsewhere, Professor Neil Ferguson, whose modelling was instrumental to the UK going into lockdown in March , said there had not been a rapid increase in Covid cases as schools have gone back. The scientist, from Imperial College London, and a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , added: The challenge will be as we head into the autumn and winter. We would expect indoor mixing to increase and weaposre still not at normal contact levels, but weaposd also expect the vaccination currently rolled out in the country, the protective effect of that to wane very slightly, and so there is likely to be some upward pressure on case numbers. He said case trends in the UK are cautiously encouraging in the sense that we have flat or even slightly declining case numbers. Prof Ferguson said as long as we can roll out the booster programme and the vaccination of teenagers as promptly as possible, and I do think weaposll probably have to move to second doses in teenagers as well to get effective levels of protection against Delta, as long as that is done in a prompt way, Iaposm moderately optimistic. We canapost rule out some need for additional measures, but I very much doubt we will need to go back into lockdown again. The expert said there may need to be the reintroduction of some degree of social distancing or other measuresthere was a really signicant uptick in hospital admissions.

By Johnson’s side in the US was Liz Truss - the woman who succeeded Raab as Foreign Secretary just seven days ago.It was a brutal illustration of Dom’s dumping that here he was at noon on Wednesday, answering MPs’ inquiries about seasonal agricultural workers, GP appointments and rail services in Dorset, rather than , miles across the Atlantic. Parliamentary convention dictates thatthe PM is absent from their weekly grilling, the Leader of the Opposition also steps aside. Keir Starmer gallantly gave way to his deputy Angela Rayner, who has more titles than a local library.  Brace yourself - Rayner is Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work and Deputy Leader of the Official Opposition. She’s also deputy Labour leader.She is also a natural Commons performer, utterly confident in her own skin and, let’s face it, always up for a scrap. Rayner ripped into Raab over the looming living standards crisis, his tussle with Truss for the keys to a luxury grace-and-favour mansion in Kent, and his Greek holiday as Afghanistan fell to the Taliban.He should “go back to his sunlounger and let me take over”, stormed Rayner.  She peppered her living standards attack with repeated use of the word “quid”: A typical family is facing a tough winter this year - Universal Credit down a thousand quid rent up  quid gas bills up  quid.” It sounded, and surely was, totally natural from her one could not imagine QC and knight of the realm Starmer sounding so comfortable deploying slang in the Commons. Raab appeared resigned to his mauling, smiling grimly at the ferocity, effectiveness and force of the onslaught. How he must have wanted to be in America.

The Labour leaderaposs much-trailed ,-word essay aposThe Road Aheadapos hits back at criticism he has failed to outline a plan for power in the  months since he seized the helm. It was published by the Fabian Society as MPs, campaigners and activists gear up for the partyaposs conference in Brighton. Here is what we have learned from the Labour leaderaposs y treatise.Starmer set out aposten principlesapos for a aposcontribution societyaposThe former Director of Public Prosecutions sets out ten principles for what he calls a contribution society in which everyone has a part to play but people are rewarded for putting in. These principles are:We will always put hard-working families and their priorities first If you work hard and play by the rules, you should be rewarded fairly People and businesses are expected to contribute to society, as well as receive Your chances in le should not be defined by the circumstances of your birth – hard work and how you contribute should matter Families, communities and the things that bring us together must once again be put above inidualism The economy should work for citizens and communities. It is not good enough to just surrender to market forces The role of government is to be a partner to private enterprise, not stle it The government should treat taxpayer money asit were its own. The current levels of waste are unacceptable The government must play its role in restoring honesty, decency and transparency in public le We are proudly patriotic but we reject the isiveness of nationalismStarmer sees the Covid pandemic as a turning pointThe Labour leader sees Covid- as a major turning point for Britain, akin to that of the recovery from World War .Starmer tells a tale of two pandemics, saying lockdown was a more dficult, damaging experience for poorer people than it was for the more affluent. The burden fell on those who couldn’t work from home and those who were already struggling, he says.He goes on to say people want to emerge from lockdown into something better, as Brits did when they emerged from the Second World War, adding: I believe we are living through a time when the inidualism that prioritises personal entitlement, moral superiority and self-interest is receding in society’s rear-view mirror.  He says: “Britain under the next Labour government will no longer be trampled by the tyranny of low expectations. “If we are to reimagine what is possible, we will need to demand high standards. “If we are to unlock the vast reserves of potential and productivity in this country, we will need to be restless. “If we are to overcome cynicism, we will need to be the party of practical action.”Labour is pro-business and will aposfixapos the Brexit dealBoris Johnson once reportedly said f*** business when told firms feared Brexit would damage the economy. Trade barriers have added an extra £m in cost since Britain left the EU and there is a growing frustration over red tape, staff shortagesand empty supermarket shelves. Starmer underlines he sees business as a force for good and pledges to fix the holes in the shoddy Brexit deal and rebuild ties with Europe. He says: We have seen from the government’s failure to properly manage our departure from the European Union what happens when the expertise and concerns of business are ignored. The sight of empty shelves in our supermarkets should be embarrassing to ministers who failed to understand the complex supply chains and streamlined logistics that British businesses rely upon. By creating unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy, the government has cost both businesses and consumers. The Labour leader has very little to say on immigration, however, saying only that the idea that the immigration and social security systems are a free-for-all has been fertile territory for populist politicians, who have sowed mistrust. Starmer will refuse to fight the culture wars Many claim Boris Johnsonaposs Tories are keen to fight the next election on the culture wars and woke issues, as campaigners raise questions on Britainaposs history, and racial, gender and social equality. Starmer calls the Tories war on woke an increasingly bizarre obsession and makes clear that he sees the battleground dferently. Rather, he thinks Labour should not wade into every row and instead focus on opposing the conspiracy theories, crankery, misinformation and hatred allowed to flourish, often as part of the debate.  He says the Government has many slogans, such as levelling up, but adds: In the absence of a defining economic project or plan, theTories have instead plunged headfirst into the murky depths of the so-called ‘culture wars’. Building bonds between fellow citizens has never been more crucial, he later adds. But rather than take on these challenges, the Conservatives have tried to exploit isions, leading to an increasingly bizarre obsession with what happens on university campuses, a crime bill that offers statues of slavers more protection than women walking down the street, and McCarthyite accusations of Marxist plots against everyone from teachers to those protesting racism. But Starmer has some fighting talk for the SNP Rather than the culture wars, Starmer sees the SNPaposs push for independence and what he calls the rise of the multi-headed hydra of nationalism as a more immediate threat.Hinting at how Labour might make the case for the Union in any second independence referendum north of the border, he claims the SNP and Scottish Tories feed off ision.He says: Both the SNP and the Conservatives use culture to distract and deflect, creating ision between people of these islands. The business of effective governance and improving people’s lives comes second to ideology. Both use nationalism freely to whip up fear of the other.  He adds: Nationalists like to portray themselves as patriots. But patriotism and nationalism are not the same. In fact, they are opposites. Nationalism represents an attempt to ide people from one another patriotism is an attempt to unite people of dferent backgrounds. Nationalism is about the casting out of the other patriotism is about finding common ground. Nationalism is the flag as a threat. Patriotism is the flag as a celebration. These are lines which will be highly contested by Nicola Sturgeon and other pro-independence figures. The Corbyn era and Labour aposnavel gazingapos is officially over Frustration at Corbynaposs rejection of Blairaposs years in power run through the treatise, with Starmer fuming that in recent years the party has been squabbling over its own past, rather than one focused on the future. He contrasts Labouraposs towering achievement in government with long periods of self-doubt and navel-gazing and lambasts his predecessor, saying: We had moved from being the party of ‘white heat’ to the party of sepia-tinged nostalgia. He adds: In recent decades, the legacy of the  Labour government has become contested to the extent that the party has at times felt like separate families living under one roof. This has been harmful and alienating. It has not progressed the cause of achieving a Labour government and has been damaging to our country. Jeremy Corbyn is not mentioned once in the document Boris Johnsonwhile the word aposfutureapos crops up some  times.Tony Blair is back in fashion In , Blair gave the  anniversary lecture for the Fabian Society, and he called it Let Us Face The Future. In Starmeraposs essay, for the same think tank, the Labour leader appears to directly reference Blairaposs critique of his party in , writing We must take inspiration from  – but that cannot mean dwelling on the past. Instead, we must face the future. He adds: “It is impossible to live in this moment and not feel the winds of changes blowing, just as they did in  and .”  He also mirrors some of New Labouraposs language, calling for a new settlement between the government, business and working people, a new deal for working people and an effective partnership of state and private sector, which sees Starmer distance himself from Corbynaposs policies of renationalising services like utilities and rail. Throughout, Starmer holds up Blairaposs, and Gordon Brownaposs successes and ambition for the country in opposition to the Toriesapos record. Starmer backs new laws to tackle racial inequality - but is less clear on trans rights Starmer pledges a new Race Equality Act and his view to tackle complex structural racism which exists in Britain. This follows the vile racism faced by England stars such as Marcus Rashford after they took the knee at games and outcry over a highly-criticised Government-commission report which claimed to have found no evidence of systemic racism in the UK. The Labour leader writes: When people across the world come together to say that black lives matter, when England footballers take the knee before the biggest games of their lives and when black people chant ‘we can’t breathe’,they aren’t asking for more nice words or inquiries – they are demanding real progress. We would introduce a new Race Equality Act in the UK, aimed at tackling the complex structural racism that holds back people from every community. While Labour has said separately that it backs reforming Gender Recognition Act and self-declaration for trans people, Starmeraposs essay makes no mention of trans rights.Mental health waiting list targets Starmer said, as Blair set his Government waiting NHS waiting list targets in , he would back similar targets for mental health services. This follows reports that people needing support for mental health problems ranging from depression and anxiety to psychosis and eating disorders are left waiting months and in some cases years for help. He said: The  Labour government set ambitious targets for waiting lists in the NHS and they worked: the next Labour government will set ourselves the same challenge on mental health. The mental health charity Mind suggest that just one in eight adults with a mental health problem are currently getting treatment  and waiting lists are soaring. Starmer plans to stick around... and for a long time  Perhaps most revealing were the final words of Starmeraposs treatise, in which he makes clear he in post for the long haul. It comes amid speculation he could face a challenge from the Left of his party and critics pointing out that Labour has yet to catch up with the Tories in the polls while an election could come as early as . Starmer says: To anyone who believes in a better future, based on these principles, I say: join us. The road ahead will be long. The journey will not always be simple. But the choices are clear and the prize at the end great. At this historic moment, Labour has a chance to once again build a better country for working people. This is the path we have chosen: let us take it together.

The most eyebrow-raising move from the leadership proposes switching back to the electoral college system for leadership elections. It would mean that any election for a new leader would see the vote split three ways between MPs, trade unions and grassroots members of Constituency Labour Parties . This would be a big sht away from the aposone member one voteapos system, which Ed Miliband brought in to dilute union influence and gave all votes equal weight.  Mr Starmer also wants to cut the number of motions put to Labour Party conference delegates.Thirdly, he wants to raise the threshold by which MPs can face a deselection threat. As it stands,a third of members or a third of affiliates want to block their candidacy at the next general election, they can trigger a contest.Trade unions asked for more time after the TULO meeting, with Unite calling for the plans to be delayed and put to a special conference organised at a later date. Mr Starmer needs backing from at least some of the partyaposs major affiliated unions - GMB, Unison, Usdaw and Unite being the largest - to get delegates at Labouraposs conference in Brighton next week to vote the plan through. A source said Mr Starmer left the meeting saying he needed time to reflect on his next move. If he refuses to back down and ditch or dilute the plans, it sets the stage for a showdown at a meeting of Labouraposs ruling National Executive Committee- a group made up of MPs, union and other senior figures - who, on Friday, could be asked to vote to press ahead and put the plan to delegates regardless. Without backing from a number of unions, and amid reports Deputy Leader Angela Rayner is sceptical of the plans, it is not guaranteed the NEC will agree.  The leadershipaposs plan would raise the bar for a selection challenge to half of both members and affiliates. The TSSA union has called the sht back to the electoral college the sort of thing associated with Victorian Tories”, while Unite boss Sharon Graham has strongly made the case for Labour to ditch old wars between Left and Right amid Covid. Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, meanwhile, called it an attempt to bounce through new rules which disenfranchise members with a grubby stitch-up deal with unions. While GMB figures were not thought to have been at the TULO meeting, Unison, a strong supporter of Mr Starmeraposs, was said to be among those calling for more time. While some of the movementaposs more Left wing unions, including CWU, TSSA and the FBU were unlikely to back the leadership, those close to Mr Starmer will be anxiously awaiting news from the GMB, Unison and Usdaw. More broadly, the row will be seen as a key test of whether Jeremy Corbynaposs successor has control over his party. When Mr Starmer chaired a meeting of his shadow cabinet on Tuesday, he said the plans would not be presented on a take it or leave it basis. He said: Iaposm prepared to take suggestions and ideas and to have a conversation and try to build consensus but the principles are important to me. “I hope TULO will support me, I believe these changes are good for their members and they strengthen our link. I know that this is dficult - change always is - but I think these changes are vital for our party’s future. “I have said I will make the Labour Party the party of working people, I am determined that the Labour party I lead focuses on the country, on the concerns of voters, so we need party reforms that better connect us with working people re-orient us toward the voters who can take us to power.” Mick Whelan, Chair of TULO, said: Keir Starmer and Labouraposs affiliated Trade Union Leaders had a positive meeting this afternoon to discuss the rule changes that the Labour leader would like to bring to conference in Brighton. There was broad consensus on the need to refocus the Labour party on the country and concerns of working people.Discussions will continue.

The Department for Educationtoday announces it has expanded its Glasses in Classes scheme to reach more than , pupils in at least  schools in England. It was trialled in Bradford and will now be expanded to Doncaster, Derby, Durham, Norwich and Breckland, and the North Yorkshire Coast. Children identied as needing glasses will receive one pair for home and one for school to help improve reading and writing skills. Children can already get free eye tests and vouchers for glasses but experts fear many poorer pupils do not have sight problems spotted in time. Under the scheme, pupils receive support from a vision co-ordinator, usually a teaching assistant, to attend follow-up eye examinations, get their prescription glasses and wear them regularly.  Schools do not usually get the results of vision screenings that pupils take in reception. But during the pilot, these results were shared with staff in schools so they knew which pupils and families to support. The scheme, first piloted at  primary schools in Bradford, aims to prevent disadvantaged pupils from being left behind because of poor eyesight. It will now be adapted for five disadvantaged areas in England under the DfEaposs Opportunity Areas programme - where the Government has targeted more resources at  social mobility cold spots. Speaking on National Eye Health Week, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: As a young boy shortly after arriving in this country, I sat at the back of the classroom with poor language skills and low confidence, struggling to engage with my lessons. Back then, I could never have dreamt of the opportunities this country would give me and I am determined to help every young person overcome obstacles, just as I was supported. Too many children still struggle with the literacy skills they need to make the most of their education. Simple steps like providing free glasses to those that need them so they can clearly see words on a page, for example, can help close the literacy gap and foster a love of learning. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said: This novel scheme focuses on young people whose learning is hampered by poor eyesight and whose circumstances mean they have either not been to see an optician or do not have the glasses they need. It is refreshing to see the Government reacting positively to a local initiative that has seen results in Bradford and extending it to a further five disadvantaged areas in the north of the country. It would be greatit could eventually be rolled out on a national basis to bring the same benefits to all young people. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leadersapos union NAHT, said: It is essential that the Government invests more in education and young people, and does so without delay. Programmes like this are encouraging but what the education sector is crying out for is a fully funded strategy for education recovery which meets the needs of all pupils in all areas of the country. Thereaposs no time to waste, particularly because the Comprehensive Spending Review will be delivered next month.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Paul WhitemanNadhim ZahawiEducationSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dozens of people who may be eligible to come to the UK under the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policywere mistakenly copied into an email earlier this month. Their email addresses were visible to all recipients, rather than being blind copied. Some  peopleaposs details were revealed, according to the BBC. The disastrous blunder comes after Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was forced to apologise for a separate breach that revealed the email addresses of around  Afghans. Terried interpreters have spoken of fears for their safety after the first data breach - and Tory MP Johnny Mercer has said Afghan allies are being hunted ruthlessly by the Taliban.  Mr Wallace told MPs this week that an official had been suspended for the first breach and expressed his fury at the blunder. It is an unacceptable level of service that has let down the thousands of members of the armed forces and veterans. On behalf of the Ministry of Defence, I apologise, Mr Wallace said. I offer the reassurances that the scheme will continue to operate and bring people back to the United Kingdom for however many are eligible and however long it takes. An MoD spokesperson said: We have been made aware of a data breach that occurred earlier this month by the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy team. This week, the Defence Secretary instigated an investigation into data handling within that team. Steps have now been taken to ensure this does not happen in the future. We apologise to those affected and extra support is being offered to them. Admiral Sir Ben Key, the commander of joint operations who led the planning and evacuation from Kabul, is leading the investigation and one person had been suspended. It also comes after documents identying Afghan workers and job applicants were abandoned in the embassy in Kabul. Mr Wallace said at the time: Clearly itaposs not good enough.

Today two power firms collapsed, leaving , customers facing higher bills. Other smaller providers are also expected to fail. The impact is not just being felt in domestic fuel bills. The sharp increase in energy prices is hurting business, disrupting supplies to stores and upping the cost of the weekly shop. It is no use ministers wringing their hands and blaming the global rise in wholesale prices. They were warned years ago that Britain required a more secure energy supply. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Other nations are weathering the storm as they invested in gas storage and ersied their sources of power. The Tories placed their faith in a broken system of market forces. We are now paying the price for their complacency. Millions of households are now set for a stark winter of soaring energy bills, higher taxes and rising inflation. The Government are blind to the economic hardship facing so many families. At least they could cancel cutting Universal Credit, which will put more people into poverty. PM all hot air Boris Johnson appealed to world leaders to join together to tackle global warming. His call comes as Britain prepares to host next month’s COP summit, where nations will be asked to commit to reducing emissions. It is crucial the meeting succeeds in its aims.

But he does himself no favours by lecturing other states about backing developing nations when his own Government has cut its ­international aid budget.

The Mirror understands there are “live discussions” inside the Department for Work and Pensionsabout changing the “taper rate” to let working families keep more money.A proposal under discussion would see the taper - which is the amount of Universal Credit withdrawn for every pound someone earns - cut from p to p. Sources say the DWP is lobbying the Treasury to improve the rate as part of Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs October  Budget. The Treasury is said to be exploring the idea.It would be the first taper change in five years, and would partially cushion the blow of the £-a-week cut - which kicks into payments between October  and November . Scroll down for an explanation of what this all means. Are you struggling on Universal Credit  E-mail webnews@mirror.  The £billion-a-year move would leave many working benefit claimants p better off, rather than the current p, for every pound they earn after tax. But sources are downbeat about whether Mr Sunak - who is demanding Whitehall cuts ahead of his Spending Review - will authorise the move. Mr Sunak has already stonewalled pleas to stop the £-a-week cut, which will save him £bn-a-year but throw hundreds of thousands of families into poverty. Evena p change in the taper is approved, it will not come close to making up for the £-a-week cut for most families. A -year-old single mum working  hours a week on minimum wage could be £. a week better offthe taper rate was cut from p to p.  But because UC is being cut by £ across the board, she would still be £. worse off than she is now. And those still covered by work allowances, or too sick to work, would not benefit at all from changes to the taper. Karl Handscomb of the Resolution Foundation think tank said: “Reducing the taper rate in Universal Credit would raise incentives for workers to earn more – and boost living standards by allowing them to keep more of their earnings. But while welcome, this is no alternative to maintaining the £ a week uplt to Universal Credit. The gains are far smaller than the £ a week cut, and would flow to better off families on UC while three million families would gain nothing at all. Virtually all households would still be signicantly worse off overall.” Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey was blasted for claiming families could work an extra two hours to make up for the £ cut. Experts said many would have to work six hours due to the taper - or nine hoursthey pay tax and national insurance. A person with knowledge of the talks told the Mirror there is now no hope of reversing the £-a-week cut. Focus is turning to the taper instead, they said, adding: “It may be that they say the cut is going ahead - but here’s a lollipop”.  A second source said cutting the taper would help push claimants towards working more hours - as Ms Coffey suggested. After job vacancies topped a million, the source said: “When the economy’s growing and there are lots of job vacancies, more money should go into the taper rate because when people start work they keep more of their money. It’s an incentive.” Every penny cut from the taper would cost £million a year once Universal Credit is fully rolled out, the IFS think tank says. Some .million out of .million claimants have a job, and could benefit from a cut in the taper. Not all would benefit as some are already spared the taper, due to having a work allowance and earnings under £ a month. UCaposs architect Iain Duncan Smith, who has demanded ministers halt the £ cut, originally wanted the taper to be p but was overruled by George Osborne.Mr Duncan Smith appeared to reveal talks about the taper were under way in a Commons debate this week. He urged Ms Coffey to use his bid to stop the cut “as justication for her negotiations with the Treasury to secure a better investment in the taper.” Labour announced last month it would cut the taper, but has not said what the new taper should be.Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the Mirror: Rising food costs, tax hikes, the energy crisis and cuts to Universal Credit are a perfect storm facing working families. Itaposs not too late for the Government to change course and cancel their cut. Labour is on the side of working people, thataposs why we would maintain the uplt and reduce the taper rate to allow people to keep more of the money they earn when we replace Universal Credit. The Lords Economic Committee called last year for a cut in the taper, saying the poorest in society were being hit with a “very high effective tax rate”. The committee, led by Tory former employment minister Lord Forsyth, said: “The principle of always making work pay has been undermined by cuts.”By buying a little bit extra with the weekly shop and putting it in the donation box located in-store, customers can help Lidl meet its target of donating million meals a year to those in need. Lidl is helping to tackle hunger in Britain’s communities through its Feed it Back scheme and has teamed up with partner Neighbourly to ensure any donated food will be put to good use every day.The key items to pop in the box are: Cereal Soup Pasta Rice Tinned tomatoes or pasta sauce Lentils, beans and pulses Tinned meat Tinned vegetables Tea and coffee Tinned fruit Biscuits UHT milk Fruit juice. Find out more about Lidlaposs Feed it Back scheme here. What is the taper rate in Universal Credit  Universal Credit allows people to keep claiming eventhey get a job, because some jobs pay so badly that the wage is not enough to sustain a family. If you earn money from a job while on UC, your benefits are tapered away by a set amount depending on how much youaposve earned after tax. For every £ you earn over a set threshold, your benefits are reduced by p. That means effectively youaposre only p better off for every £ you earn after tax. The taper is designed to aposmake work payapos - to smooth people off UC as they re-enter the world of work without abandoning them completely. But critics and charities have long said the taper is just too high. It leaves too little incentive to get a job because people need - hours just to make £. The taper doesnapost apply to earnings that you make under a work allowance - £ a monthyou get housing help, and £ a monthyou donapost. However, only some claimants are eligible for a work allowance - in other words,they have responsibility for a child or limited capability for work. Even those who are eligible will tip over the work allowance and into the taperthey work just eight hours a week at minimum wage.

Mr Johnson had previously insisted the UK would be first in line for a free trade deal - which was touted by some Brexiteers as one of the major benefits of leaving the EU.  But attempts to kickstart trade talks on his first trip to the US since becoming PM appeared to fizzle out. Government insiders suggested Britain would look at other options including asking to join the the existing US-Mexico-Canada agreementinstead. A diplomatic source said: There are a iety of dferent ways to do this. The question is whether the US administration is ready. The ball is in the USaposs court. It takes two to tango. But a spokesman for the PM dismissed the comments on Wednesday in a briefing for Westminster reporters. Thataposs not an approach we are currently taking, the spokesman said.Our focus is on trying to negotiate a bilateral deal with the US, which is in the interests of Britain.Ex-President Donald Trump, who oversaw the USMCA pact, was more enthusiastic over the prospect of a free trade deal with Britain which he said would be fantastic and big.But the PM has sought to dampen expectations of an imminent agreement with Mr Biden. Environment Secretary George Eustice struck a downbeat note over the hopes of an UK-UK trade deal. He said that the UK still very much hope to be able to put together an agreement with the United States but itaposs just not a priority for the Biden administration.Mr Eustice also risked a row with the US when he said Mr Biden was wrong over Brexit.The President, who is proud of his Irish roots, had raised concerns about the impact of part of Mr Johnsonaposs EU trade deal on peace on the island of Ireland.  The Northern Ireland protocol, a key part of the deal, has created a trade border in the Irish Sea by effectively keeping it in the EUaposs single market for goods. During his White House summit with the PM, Mr Biden said he felt very strongly about any issues to the peace process. And I would not at all like to see - nor, I might add, would many of my Republican colleagues like to see - a change in the Irish accords, the end result having a closed border in Ireland, he said. Mr Johnson said thataposs absolutely right, adding: On that point, Joe, weaposre completely at one, nobody wants to see anything that interrupts or unbalances the Belfast Good Friday Agreement. But back in the UK, Mr Eustice said the President is probably at the moment just reading the headlines. He told Sky News: We think he is wrong because the truth is that unless we have a sustainable solution that enables trade to continue between GB and Northern Ireland then we are going to have issues, and that itself would become a challenge to the Belfast Agreement. We will obviously explain to the United States effectively it is tantamount to saying that potatoes grown in one part of the United States canapost be sold in another part of the United States. When you explain some of those provisions in detail, it is understood by the US government that that clearly does not make any sense and therefore should be revisited. Mr Eustice said the protocol was very complicated and Iaposm not sure hedoes fully appreciate all of that.

news politics universal-credit-top-tory-links-\"Universal Credit: George Eustice discusses cutsByBen GlazeDeputy Political EditorDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep | commentsA top Cabinet Minister has claimed he is “comfortable” with hitting six million poor Brits with a £-a-week cut - despite the energy price crisis.Environment Secretary George Eustice, who is “a trustee of a family discretionary will trust which owns shares” in a -acre Cornish fruit and veg farm, backed stripping £, a year from households on Universal Credit.Asked by the BBChe felt “comfortable” with going ahead with the welfare cut, he admitted: “You have to look at all of these things in context and yes, the answer is I do. “Because we are seeing prices rise, yes, that is putting some pressure on household incomes. “But more importantly we are also seeing wages rise, particularly for the lowest paid. “It is a very tight labour market at the moment - there are over a million job vacancies at the moment, so those who want to work are finding it easy to find work.”  It comes despite more than million households on Universal Credit facing an energy bills hike of more than £ a year from October  - within weeks of the benefit being cut. Some .million of those households are estimated to be on the most expensive pre-payment meters and could end up paying £ more per year. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was due to be grilled by MPs this morning over the soaring gas prices that are set to hammer family budgets at the same time as benefit cut. The Cabinet Minister appears before the Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee amid mounting fears of blackouts and spiralling costs. Mr Kwarteng has ruled out nationalisation and is prepared to let dozens of smaller firms fail. But he has suggested taxpayer-backed loans could be offered to larger companies which take on customers of suppliers which go bust. Last night ministers handed over tens millions of pounds in taxpayersapos cash to resolve the carbon dioxideshortage that has hit food supplies. Industry figures had warned that shoppers could begin to see empty shelves within days due to a shortage of CO, which is used in the production process for meat and some frozen goods. The crisis was triggered when a major US-owned fertiliser firm - which produces CO as a by-product - halted UK production following a surge in wholesale gas prices. The Government has brokered a deal with CF Industries to restart production. Taxpayers will fund the firm’s operating costs for up to three weeks and the money won’t have to be repaid.  Environment Secretary George Eustice admitted there were still challenges in the food supply chain but insisted that Brits would not face shortages in the run up to the festive period. Despite the deal ending  weeks before Christmas he said today: “Christmas is safe, of course.” Universal Credit’s own architect, Baroness Philippa Stroud, has warned it will hit more than , people who are teetering on the poverty line. Yet Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey previously said she was “entirely happy” with slashing the benefit.Asked earlier this month are you entirely happy with this , Ms Coffey told Sky News: Yes. We made this decision earlier this year, the Chancellor announced it in the Budget.And thataposs why we’re building the update to the plan for jobs to make sure as we see the end of the furlough scheme, the support that’s happened there, as we see the end of the other support schemes... that we accelerate our plan for jobs.Comment MORE ON Conservative PartyCF Industries Inc.Universal Credit\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Professor Chris Whitty told MPs that young people between  and -years-old are currently driving Covid transmission, with infection rates highest in this age group. All children aged  to -years-old are now being offered a single dose of the Pfizer jab after the UKaposs Chief Medical Officers backed the move. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhad stopped short of recommending this on medical grounds alone, effectively handing the decision to the CMOs. At a hearing of the Education Committee, Prof Whitty explained that the UKaposs top medics decided to recommend mass vaccination of jabs for under-s partly to prevent disruption in schools.  Prof Whitty said the comparison was between a child being vaccinated against a near certainty that child will get Covid. He said fewer school days would be lost due to being vaccinated compared to children getting the virus, as pupils with Covid would be off school - and some will have signicant symptoms. Asked about modelling for days lost due to short-term disruption by Tory chairman Robert Halfon, Prof Whitty said: “Our view is firmly that people who have an infection are likely to be off school for longer than people who have a vaccine, on average. “Therefore since virtually any child, unvaccinated, is likely to get an infection at some point between  and , that is the correct comparison, not against nothing. Children currently have the highest transmission rates of any age group, he said. Prof Whitty told MPs: There is definitely substantial transmission happening in this age group. In fact, the age group weaposre talking about is the one in which the highest rate of transmission is currently occurring, as far as we can tell.  But he said that vaccination will reduce that risk. Asked what how many youngsters have already had Covid, Prof Whitty said: It ies by age and it does also y by setting, but I thinkwe go for roughly half I think that is a reasonable stab at this. Thataposs half over the period of the entire epidemic to date, and weaposve got quite a way to run. Weaposre running into winter so thereaposs still quite a lot of damage that could be done in terms of disruption. Deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam told MPs that the Delta iant is so infectious it was not a theoretical risk. He said: I think it is really quite inevitable that they will be so at some point. Prof Van-Tam said it would be extremely inconvenient to be laid low with a cough, fever, and respiratory symptoms for pupils sitting GCSEs and A-Levels. Pupils in England began being offered their Covid vaccine in schools this week. The rollout is being managed by the School Age Immunisation Service , which already does inoculations for flu and HPV in schools. Parents are being asked to give consent for their children to be vaccinated. But children can overrule their parentsthey are deemed competent to make the decision through a legal precedent known as a Gillick competence.

The snake was bleeding from its jaw and seen coughing up blood opposite a layby on the B near Roden on Friday. RSPCA were called to attend the scene after the constrictor was discovered with a broken jaw by two motorists. Officers were able to safely contain the reptile in a large duvet cover using a specialist pole with a hook. The snake was taken to a vets and given pain relief but died later that night. The body of another long-deceased snake of a similar size was then found nearby, prompting fears that the road is being used as a place to dump unwanted exotic pets. Following an investigation, the local RSPCA said it believed both reptiles were deliberately abandoned in the area.  A spokesperson for the organisation said: “Normally when we get a call like this we find the snake has been misidentied and itaposs actually a small native species, so we were very surprised when we arrived and saw a six-foot boa constrictor on the road. ”Itaposs very sad that this beautul creatureaposs le ended like this. Sadly we think this snake was probably abandoned as itaposs a very isolated location and there are no houses around for at least a mile. The discovery of the body of another snake close by also leads us to believe that someone has deliberately left them.” Locals have described the findings as the “stuff of nightmares” and expressed fears for the safety of the neighbourhood and their children and pets. One person wrote on social media: Is it just me or is this freaking anybody  out  I donapost want live ft snakes slithering around the village.” Another added: This is literally the stuff of my nightmares. My skin is crawling just thinking about it.” A third person added: “You’ve got to think about these poor reptiles too, they won’t last long in our weather without the proper care.”In response, someone wrote: “Exactly, they will be hungry. And that’s why I don’t want to let my pet out. These animals can be brutal killers and would target something small.” Although non-venomous, boa constrictors are said to “eat almost anything” they can catch in the wild and their jaws can stretch wide enough to swallow large prey whole.  The RSPCA inspector said these sorts of incidents were “not unusual”, adding: “We receive hundreds of calls every year relating to reptiles, and some of these have either escaped or may have been abandoned by their owners. “Sadly snakes and lizards often end up in our care as some owners don’t realise the commitment that is involved in meeting their needs.

He attempted to pay for his fare on board using a £ Scottish sterling note and claims to have been told the note was not a legal tender. It left him with no option but to walk the two mile journey to school which involved crossing the Conwy bridge and busy roads from Llandudno Junction.Speaking to North Wales Live, Kelly said: “I noticed The Arriva app wasn’t working earlier that morning when I tried buying Ashtonaposs bus ticket for him to get to school. “I gave him a five pound note, to get afor the day in hope that the app would work the following day so he could get his ‘M-Ticket’. “Unfortunately it happened to be a Scottish sterling note - which, regardless is a legal tender. “Ashton was waiting with friends on Victoria Drive for the bus and when it came the driver refused the payment, and told him the payment wasn’t a valid form of payment and refused to accept the note and making him exit the bus before it left. “He was left alone at one of Llandudno Junctions’ busiest points at half eight in the rush hour morning whilst the bus drove off with his friends on. “Having only been at the school two weeks, and turning  only six months ago, Ashton was left to walk to school which is just over two- miles from the bus stop in the freezing cold crying his eyes out that early in the morning. “He recently had stitches in his eyebrow from a head injury, and the stitches are noticeable, yet that driver still refused him, anything could have happened on that route to school.” She says she has contacted Arriva about what happened, but claims sheaposs had no apology, only a comment confirming that no child should be left alone at the side of the street. She added: Iaposm thankful that Ashton was so nervous about starting the school as this allowed me to drive the route with him several times before the term started, little did I know that would come into play for such silly reasons. ”You hand over your child to them. You expect that your child will be able to get to school safely. As a grown man, making a child walk two miles to school, that driver should feel ashamed of himself.” Arrivaaposs website states: Children aged under  and those people who, in the reasonable opinion of the driver, are vulnerable, at risk or in distress, and are unable to pay their fare will be carried at all times. They may be asked to provide their name and address in order that the fare due could be collected at a later date. In these circumstances, the driver will issue a single ticket for one journey allowing the inidual to travel to their home or the nearest stop thereto. Arriva have been contacted byfor comment.

Liz King from Abergavenny, south Wales, stepped forward to trial the Novavax vaccine last year saying she felt guilty as a retired nurse about not being there to help her colleagues during the first wave of the pandemicLiz was originally told thatany other approved vaccines came on the market she would be able to drop out of the study to take it up, reports Wales Online. She said: “I’m a retired nurse and felt incredibly guilty in the Spring of  that I wasn’t able to help my ex colleagues during the first wave of Covid-. So when I had the chance to volunteer for a vaccine trial I went for it.” “This was November before any vaccines were approved,” she said. “The saidan approved vaccine came on the market we could drop out of a trial, that was in the consent form but I also asked it verbally at my first appointment. “It was a blind trial and % of the participants had Novavax and % had saline [a placebo]. I thought I had had saline because I had no side effects at all, not even a sore arm. I had the first one in November and the second at the beginning of December.”  There Liz was asked to sign an updated consent for which was  pages long. She scanned through it and signed. Upon closer reading she realised that there was a small but signicant change. She said: “It said we would be discouraged from having an approved vaccine because using it with Pfizer or AstraZeneca hadn’t yet been tested. I wasnapost worried about it because we were being assured that because the vaccine had done well in phase one and phase two trials and that approval was imminent - in a couple of months at least. I was offered both Pfizer in January and AstraZeneca in April but I was happy to stay on the trial because I had been told by this point I knew I had had the vaccine not the placebo and it appeared it would be approved.” Fast forward to now and it seems likely thatthe Novavax vaccine is approved it won’t be until . Liz has tried to get another vaccine such as Pfizer but is now not allowed.  “I had been emailing the health board for a month trying to get a response and they never came back to me,” she said. “Then I rang and I was told they would call me back and they never called me back. So on Saturday I went to the walk-in centre in Newport and after waiting an hour while they had several discussions they eventually said no because I had been given the trial vaccine - when they said no I just burst into tears.” Liz is able to get a Covid pass because the NHS app acknowledges that she has had a vaccine. But because the vaccine is not approved she is facing the following problems: She cannot travel abroad anywhere which requires a vaccine. She has no ideathe vaccine she took actually offers her full protection because the final results are not out. Evenshe is protected she doesn’t knowthis immunity will wane. She is unable to get any booster jabs. “I am trapped,” she said. “It really is like something from Kafka. It is exactly what it is like. Itaposs not just me. There were , of us all across the UK but now some of them have jumped ship. I think some of them lied to get a dferent vaccine. Good on them, I wish I had. I donapost know how many of us are left but there must be thousands of us in this situation.” One of the frustrating things about this is that Liz took a risk to help develop the vaccines, but now is being affected to her detriment for doing so. She even volunteered at a vaccination centre this year. “Iaposve administered lots of other peopleaposs vaccines,” she said. “At the end of clinics sometimes we would have three or four doses left and we would be scrambling around to try and use up the remaining doses. I never once asked for one because I was committed to the trial I was doing.  “Now we are just stuck in this limbo. Last year they were all happy for us to take a jab and happy for us to do it. But now the nanny state is making decisions for me about whether or not Iaposm allowed a booster. “Iaposm not speaking out for me, Iaposm doing it for all of us who were on that trial. I want to have to approve vaccines and I want to be in the same position as the rest of the population. “I donapost want thanks butpeople like me hadn’t volunteered we wouldnapost have vaccines. At the very least I shouldnapost be inconvenienced after having volunteered. “I feel abandoned and so let down by the system. It is grossly unfair that people who volunteered to trial an experimental vaccine are at a disadvantage and have less rights and liberties than the general population. I will never volunteer again and will advise others not to.” Liz is very keen to point out that she has no problem with the Novavax vaccine itself and doesn’t want to do anything to suggest it isn’t effective. “I absolutely donapost want to cast any doubt on the Novavax vaccine,” she said. “The science will tell us how good it is or not and I donapost want to give any ammunition to anti-vaxxers. Iaposm not criticizing the vaccine in anyway - itaposs kept me safe for -  months.” A Health and Care Research Wales spokeswoman said: We really appreciate the hard work and involvement of all participants in Covid- vaccine clinical trials. Anyone participating in the Novavax trial should have had two active doses of vaccine and have protection against Covid-. We are aware of the issue affecting some participants having additional vaccinations and are awaiting the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationto advise further on this.” Comment MORE ON Newport CorporationAstraZeneca plcPfizer Inc.NHSNovavax Inc.Apps\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A lack of lorry drivers and Covid restrictions mean that the usual deliveries of the festive trees could be affected said Chris Bonnett, the founder of Gardening Express. He’s also expecting a surge in demand after last yearaposs muted celebrations, as families and friends celebrate the festivities together. Lorry driver shortages in Denmark are expected to impact imports to the UK with any Covid related restrictions further adding to the problems. Denmark is a major producer of live Christmas trees with around % of its crop exported to other European nations. Last year it faced problems after it halted exports in an attempt to control a Coronavirus mutation found on mink farms.Now the shortage of drivers in Denmark could affect the distribution of Christmas trees across Europe. With fewer than  days until Christmas, Bonnett is already seeing a jump in the number of customers searching for Christmas trees on his site despite the festive range not yet fully live. He’s urging customers to order early to ensure they’re able to secure a tree ahead of the big day. It comes as the public have also been warned to prepare for a shortage of turkeys due to a lack of available CO, while there could also be empty shelves in supermarkets due to other delivery problems. Chris said: “The last few years have played havoc with the Christmas tree market. Mild winters in Scandinavian countries have made it more complicated to fell trees. Add in the Covid restrictions in place last year and the current shortage of lorry drivers and you can see why we’re concerned that there could be a shortage of trees. “A Christmas tree is an essential part of the festivities, not just on Christmas Day but in the run up - picking the tree, squeezing it into the car and decorating ahead of the celebrations. “This year it’ll mean even more after the locked down restrictions of last year which is why we’re already seeing a surge in the number of customers searching for Christmas trees. “Hopefully between now and December, things will improve.” Bonnett added: “We are seeing issues with disruption across the retail sector, from food and drink to gts and clothing. “For Britons really wanting to go all out to celebrate this year, the best advice is to plan ahead and get all the essentials pre-ordered so you can enjoy the festivities without the stress.”Comment MORE ON ChristmasChristmas treesCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsSpread the cheer!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Under government plans unveiled last week, PCR swab tests are set to be replaced with lateral flows. While faster and cheaper, the tests do not need to be sent off to a lab for the results to come through, meaning they are open to fraud. Travel industry sources have said travellers might have to carry out a swab in sea or air terminals with officials watching to remove the chance of people cheating, thereports. Alternatively, they could be done via a video consultation.  A source told the publication: “You could have a simple mail-order system but the problem is that you have no verication whatsoever. “You only have to look at social media to see videos of people faking it.” It comes after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said yesterday the Government aimed to introduce the new testing regime for fully jabbed travellers “as quickly as possible”.  If the new regime comes into force before October half term, holidays will be signicantly cheaper for those looking to get away. Typically lateral flow tests cost a lot less than PCRs, which have added hundreds of pounds to holiday bills. Mr Shapps told the Transport Committee hearing on Wednesday that he did not have an exact date for when testing restrictions would be lted but said his colleagues at the Department of Health are aware of half term when families will be wishing to go on holiday. Itaposs clear the range of measures I introduced this week and last week are going to make a big dference and people will be able to travel much more freely, he said. Part of that is the removal of the PCR test on day two and replacing it with a much simpler lateral flow test. Theyare aware of half term and are working closely with the private-sector providers to ensure we can do this as quickly as possible.

Lauren, , and Bill Kenn, , from Kirkcaldy, Fe, in Scotland, have been together for eight years, but still endure cruel taunts whenever they go out. Despite the couple getting together when Lauren was , Bill was targeted online by close friends who called him Jimmy Savile, while strangers have accused him of liking children. But the couple have refused to let the comments affect them and insist theyaposre happier than ever. Lauren, a stay-at-home mum, says: Since Bill and I got together, we have dealt with a lot of judgement. But we have learned to laugh it off and it has only made us stronger.  Bill is the love of my le and I know weaposre made for each other. In September , Lauren met Bill, a retired crane operator, at a local karaoke night. Lauren says: Bill was wriggling his hips and dancing before he came over to introduce himself. I was only  and I guessed he was around .

I needed a place to stay and Bill kindly offered.  The morning after I moved in, he told me heaposd fallen for me and kissed me.

They all have so many clothes that Iaposve had to give them their own built in wardrobe!  I buy them new clothes every week because I canapost help myself - I always knew I would get outfits for them but didnapost expect to get them so many. Whatever you can get for kids, I try and get it for the dogs. Cupcake even has her own little pink toy Audi car and she loves sitting in there. If we hadnapost had dogs, we would have definitely had children.

When we go on holiday, we make sure we go on staycations so the dogs can come with us. If weaposre having a date night, theyaposll join us and eat whatever weaposre having like steak, chicken, or turkey.  We recently took them to a cafe and they turned their noses up at the bacon because it wasnapost smoked! They like their luxurious lestyle - they all sleep in our bed and love getting dressed up. I have no social le because when Iaposm not working, Iaposll take them to doggy friendly places. We have no plans of having kids because I treat my dogs like kids and love being a mum to them. Despite receiving a lot of backlash, Claire has no plans to get rid of their wardrobes and insists they love playing dress up. She added: When Iaposm working, Iaposll get home from work and put them in clothes straight away - they never go out naked. This morning, Cupcake ran into the dressing room and sat waiting for me to get her into her outfit because she loves being dressed up.  I get most of the clothes from an online boutique and theyaposre actually ambassadors for them now. I get negative comments all the time people think I shouldnapost dress them up but itaposs normal for us and the dogs love it. If the dogs are unhappy, Iaposd never do it but they love it and I get so much enjoyment out of it. They get a lot of attention on walks - I have a little bag, pram and buggy for them so we do get strange looks sometimes! The fluffy pooches have their own daily routine and are always tended to even when their parents are at work. Claire explained: We get up in the morning at am. They donapost like breakfast during the week but I cook them breakfast at the weekend. I clean their face, put their kibble out and Iaposll get them dressed.

After getting engaged in , Alex, a store supervisor, and -year-old Dan, a factory maintenance manager, wanted to marry on a budget while saving for a house renovation. But the parents to Samuel, four, reckon their clever hacks saved them around £, - and it was the perfect day. Alex said: People can pay thousands and thousands for their dream wedding but we couldnapost justy it. Doing everything ourselves was ten times the amount of stress but the end result was amazing. We were nervous but the end result better than we ever could have imagined. We managed to keep budgets low and still have the perfect day - I wouldnapost have changed a thing. Alex and Dan had shelved their wedding preparation for two years due to the pandemic - before they decided to take the leap and set a date in March. In order to juggle a pricey home renovation on their three-bed detached bungalow alongside their wedding, they decided to take a thrty approach wherever possible. With the date set for August , it was all hands on deck for the couple alongside their friends and family to bring everything together in the ultimate DIY mission.  But despite the odds stacked against them with a -person guest list, the coupleaposs spending totted up to just over £, - miles below what many couples choose to spend on their big day. Alex said: We just couldnapost justy using the money on the wedding when we knew it was needed on our house. I searched online and saw a lot of people saying their weddings cost upwards of £,, and we werenapost going to spend that. But at the same time, we really wanted to get married, so we aimed to do both. The couple had their service at a local church - totalling £ - before everyone took a five minute stroll back to their house, where they hosted the reception in the back garden.  They cut costs on music by taking their own sound system and using a seven-day free trial on YouTube to stream it - and dodged paying for a verger as their friend at the church offered to step in for free. The outfits worn by the couple, their son, and their bridesmaids were second hand from sites - with Alex getting her own dress, a Kenneth Winston originally worth over £, for a steal of just £ on Facebook Marketplace. Alex added: I did have to pay an extra £ to have the dress altered by a seamstress - but it was still a great deal. The enormous marquees erected in their back garden were borrowed from friends for free, with £ spent on strands of lights to give it a cosy feel. Their giant three-tier cake was made by a dedicated family member for free, as a wedding gt - while green-fingered Alex grew her bouquet in their own back garden using packets of seeds totalling a just handful of pounds. Her home-grown bouquet was made of an arrangement of cosmos, lavender, eucalyptus, gypsophilia and achillea. Food on offer was a buffet spread to feed their  hungry guests - prepared by their loyal bridesmaids the day before - and featured Mediterranean-style dishes including baked salmon, antipasti kebabs and a bean salad. Shopping at Aldi, they got the whole lot for £ - around £ a head - along with bottles of own-brand Pimms and prosecco totalling £. By buying most of their decorations from stores such as The Range and Dunelm, they kitted out the entire aposdo with candles, chalkboards, bunting and hay bales for under £. Entertainment included hiring a local musician for £, a photo booth for £ and a childrenaposs bouncy castle for £. The total cost of the wedding came to around £, thanks to their thrty approach - instead of the tens of thousands many spend on their perfect day. Alex said: It was ten times the stress doing it yourself rather than paying someone , but the end result was better than we imagined. Weaposre lucky to have such supportive friends and family. The couple got the best of both worlds by celebrating their wedding while still renovating their house - and Alex revealed the thousands of pounds they saved have already gone to good use. She explained: Earlier in the year we knocked down a wall in our home and made a new dining room. We also had a new patio fitted and re-turfed the lawn. Just six weeks ahead of the wedding, we had a new driveway installed too. The newlywed parents set off on a week-long honeymoon in Cornwall with four-year-old Samuel before ing to married le to continue their renovation work. Reflecting on their journey, Alex said: It was partly me being stubborn and refusing to pay for something we could do ourselves - but it paid off! It does feel fabulous to have had that level of creativity. We wouldnapost have changed a thing!

Mike Coles, who has lived in Woodwalton, Cambridgeshire, for  years, had been campaigning for  years after he first experienced flooding in the village.A decade later it flooded again in December , Cambridgeshire Live reports.This resulted in at least two properties suffering from flood damage, including the house where Mr Coles lives with his we Christine.The downstairs of their property was rendered unlivable and they were given the option to move to a hotel or to stay in their home upstairs. Unfortunately, the flooding happened during the height of the pandemic, and Mr Coles and his we did not feel comfortable staying in a hotel.Mr Coles said: “Instead, we just stayed upstairs for seven months. We managed, but it wasn’t the best situation, but we were safer here than we would be in a hotel.”  To push the campaigning further, Mike and Christine came up with the phrase the forgotten village” to help raise awareness of their situation and the need for something to be done. He said: “We stopped our house from being flooded once before,  years ago, that’s where the first campaign started because of the dyke.Mr Coles called and emailed the local authorities throughout the decade asking for help to reduce flooding in the area.Mr Coles said he would ask the authorities for the villageaposs gullies and dykes to be cleared to help prevent another flood from occurring. These dykes act as a type of barrier used to regulate and stop water from a river coming through, and a gully is a type of drain.  Explaining why his campaigning is important Mr Coles added: “I just think I owe this at least to my grandchildren. “I donapost want to leave this world feeling very sad and guilty about the fact that I didnapost do my best to help to leave a better place for my grandchildren than I lived it”. A Cambridgeshire County Council spokesperson said: “Three main risk areas have been identied: New Road, The Cross and village green, and Braefield. The council has undertaken visits to the affected areas and held meetings with residents, while our highways team has planned survey works to identy any obstructions within the watercourses. Gullies in Woodwalton are programmed to be cleansed between October and December .

The couple sat down for a tell-all chat with the talk show host in March and made several claims against the royal family. They alleged that there had been conversations about how dark son Archieaposs skin would be, and Meghan claimed she was denied help for her mental health despite having suicidal thoughts. The interview was nominated for a prestigious Emmy award in the Outstanding Hosted Nonfiction Series or Special category, but it was pipped to the post by the documentary Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy. Speaking to the Daily Star, royal expert and film critic Richard Fitzwilliams said he had originally thought it had a very good chance” of winning after it was screened in  countries and had Oprah fronting it.But he added: They were given too easy a le - there wasn’t a single point that Oprah pushed them on. You can see why an awards ceremony would see flaws that the average viewer would not pick up on.

Following the airing of the chat earlier in the year, Buckingham Palace issued a statement saying the Queen was saddened by the allegations made by Harry and Meghan, but added that some recollections may y. However, in Finding Freedom, an unauthorised biography of the couple, friends of Harry and Meghan claim the Queen has not taken full ownership of the issues they raised during the Oprah interview.The authors of the updated book also say the statement did not go unnoticed.Meanwhile, Harry is set to appear on TV tonight in a BBC documentary that pays tribute to his late grandfather Prince Philip.The special programme, which also features the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Andrew and Prince Charles, was originally arranged to mark the Dukeaposs th birthday in June, but he sadly died two months before his centenary. Interviews with the royals were recorded both before and after Philipaposs death, with Harryaposs tributes filmed in Calornia where he now lives after quitting the UK. In one clip, Harry talks about his grandfather and grandmotheraposs relationship, calling them the most adorable couple. He says: The two of them together were just the most adorable couple. To me knowing the cheekiness of him and knowing that behind what the world sees you have two iniduals who were very much in love and both, from a very young age, have dedicated their le to service... that is an incredible bond between two people.

But experts have revealed you should actually be waiting another month, when the clocks go back and the winter season really starts kicking in. As turning on your heating is a sure sign that winter has arrived central heating experts at PlumbNation have said you shouldnapost be switching it on any earlier than October . Expert Jordan Chance said: Turning on your central heating is notably one of the sure signs that winter has arrived.Although there is no single temperature at which you should turn your heating on, many aim for the time when clocks go back, falling this year on October st, he told the Daily Echo. “There are, however, a series of ways to delay putting your heating on, keeping you warmer for longer and saving you those extra pennies. Using a draught excluder is one of the quickest and cheapest ways to keep your home warm, preventing cold air from entering and warm air from leaving under your doors.What do you think of this   Let us know in the comments below “Keeping your curtains closed, or investing in a thermal curtain lining can likewise help to prevent warm air from escaping - this trick alone can reduce heat loss by up to %. Whilst a favourite saying of parents is to ‘put a jumper on’, this old age argument can certainly keep you warmer for longer, and save the big switch on for a later date. It is also important to note that leaving your heating on low all day does not reduce your heating bills. Having the heating on only as and when you need it, is the best way to save energy. Using a thermostat with a timer offers a simple and speedy solution to controlling your heating effectively.” Top  tips to help you save money on heating . Upgrade Your Thermostat Your thermostat controls your home’s temperature by communicating with your boiler. Thermostats, particularly in older homes with older heating systems, can degrade over time. Such degradation can lead to delays in your boiler switching on, or your home being heated at much higher temperatures than required. Upgrading your thermostat could provide for greater accuracy in thermostat to boiler communication, preventing energy from being wasted, and saving you money. . Stop Draughts!  Stopping heat from escaping through unwanted gaps is one of the cheapest and most effective ways to save energy and money. To draught-proof your home, you need to primarily identy the ‘problem areas’ where draughts are causing issues, these could include doors, windows, chimneys and floorboards. You can block unwanted gaps by using draught-proofing strips around your windows and doors, or flexible silicone-based filler to fill the gaps in your floorboards. . Add an Extra LayerInstead of heating your home to be warm enough to walk around in shorts and a t-shirt, why not turn your thermostat down and put on a jumper  Adding clothing layers will insulate your body and make it easier to regulate your body’s temperature. The more layers you wear, the less the heating will need to be on, reducing your heating bills. . Introduce Soft Furnishings Soft furnishings, such as curtains and rugs, can make all the dference in saving money on your heating. If you have a carpeted home then it will naturally help to boost insulation however,you have hard flooring investing in some good quality materials, such as a plush rug, will help to prevent heat from being lost. . Turn Your Thermostat Down By °C  An excessive heating bill can be easily rectied with the ‘step-down’ challenge. By turning your heating down by just °C, you can save up to % on your heating bill. The typical heating range is between - °C - so why don’t you see how low you can go  It is also important to avoid classic thermostat ‘faux pas’. Contrary to popular belief, turning up your thermostat does not heat up your room quicker. This method will only send your energy bills skyrocketing. . Clean Your Radiators If your radiators aren’t in your weekly cleaning routine, then it’s time to add them. A buildup of dust can affect your health, allergies and your heating bill. Layers of dust in your radiator can prevent heat from escaping effectively, meaning your radiators will have to work harder to warm your room. . Don’t Dry Your Clothes On Your Radiator We would recommend that you stop using your radiators to dry your clothes. The clothes that you place over the top of your radiators prevent the heat from escaping and heating your room, meaning that your boiler has to pick up the slack and work at a greater rate - increasing costs. Similarly, the increase in the air’s moisture can create condensation, leading to potential issues with mould and dampness. . Check Your Radiator Cover If you have a radiator cover make sure to check that it is a good conductor of heat. Radiator covers made from materials such as wood are poor conductors and can prevent heat from being dispersed effectively - wasting energy and money. If your radiator cover has a solid top then you may be losing even more heat, as it will be absorbed by the top of the cover. . Bleed Your Radiators Bleeding your radiator is essential in preventing the efficiency of your radiator from decreasing, as a result of air entering your heating system. The quickest way to checkair has entered your heating system is to turn your central heating on and feel your radiator. If the radiator is warm at the bottom but cold at the top this is generally a sign that air is present. . Get Your Boiler Serviced If your boiler is ageing and has seen better days, there’s a strong chance it won’t be working as efficiently as it once was. Defective boilers can increase your heating bill massively as they will need to work signicantly harder to bring your home up to the desired temperature. We recommend that you get your boiler serviced every  months , to ensure that your boiler is running efficiently and safely.

They are renting out their old home after buying and refurbishing the campervan at a cost of around £,. What do you think of their decision  Do you fancy an adventure like this  Have your say in the comments  The van also features a table which acts as a school desk. It has lots of storage for learning resources such as workbooks, Lego, journals, crafting kits, board games, maps and jigsaws and can be put away while they are driving. Kate, , said: Itaposs something we have been intending to do for quite a while. Itaposs still early days but so far itaposs what I expected really. There are highs and lows and niggles but equally it can be so serene at times. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter We now live very frugally but itaposs a very rewarding way to live. We had to de-clutter and get rid of a lot of things, but that process has been going on for a while now. With regards to toys, we have had a one in, one out system for some time, so for every new toy that comes in they donate an old one to charity.  Due to lockdowns people assume homeschooling means not mixing with other children but in my experience, it is actually more sociable than mainstream school. We have a really busy schedule, staying in campsites run by other home educators and doing activities and things with other children and families all the time.  It definitely gives the kids a deeper connection with themselves and also with nature and the community too. They arenapost learning about history from a text book, instead we go to visit the castle itself and learn that way. Cooking has become much more basic, itaposs all one pot meals really but we also have an outdoor fire pit which is useful. Of course, we miss our friends and family back home but they do come to visit. Edith sometimes says she misses her old bedroom, I think she probably had the biggest bedroom in the house, but they are enjoying this new adventure just as much as us and we canapost wait to see where it takes us.

I’ve lost count of the times he’s told me that school’s “boooorring” and he wants to go to video game school which would be way more fun. If I’m honest, it’s an ­ambition I’d half hoped he’d grow out of, but after attending a tech event this week, I realise he’s more clued up about the future of work than I am.London Tech Week brings together some of the biggest players in the digital field to discuss the state of the industry. The question that kept coming up again and again was what is the UK going to do about its chronic digital skills shortage Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  The industry agrees immediate and drastic attention is needed. And a recent report by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport revealed there are almost , UK jobs currently vacant that require data skills. There was also an unanimous plea for the education system to put technology at the heart of the curriculum. From where I’m sitting, that certainly doesn’t appear to be happening. My eldest son took and then quickly dropped out of GCSE computing while courses to teach my video game enthusiast to code or to get into tech are ludicrously expensive. If the pandemic taught us anything, it’s that the future will be all about the tech sector, and at the moment, we are woefully under preparing our children for what lies ahead. Tech has its own PR problem. Too many young people think tech is only for kids that are good at maths and science. The technologists I met on Monday assured me that is far from the truth. There are jobs for people with so many dferent skill sets and the sooner young people are introduced to the sector the easier it will be for them to land one. The UK is by no means the only country facing challenges in this area, but it’s lagging behind countries like the US, Singapore, Sweden and Denmark. Coincidentally Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the Swedish founder of tech firm Klarna, revealed he got his first computer from a government scheme. Before he was dumped as education secretary, Gavin Williamson decided one of his key ­objectives to help make society more equal for state school children was to learn Latin. He even sank £million into a pilot scheme for  UK schools. Doesn’t this show just how out of touch our education system is on this  There was certainly consensus from industry movers and shakers that schools and teachers must adapt to the needs of the tech industry. If not, the repercussions for future generations don’t bear thinking about.

And now the genius tot has impressed yet again by learning how to count up to  in Japanese in less than  hours. Proud mum Jazelle, , from South West London, tells the Mirror Isaiah has been able to grasp new information extraordinarily easily from the age of five months. The early years teacher explains: “One day Isaiah was watching a phonic video on my phone on YouTube, he scrolled to the videos at the bottom and clicked on a Japanese numeracy video. “He listened to it once and was fixated. He asked to watch it again, then before I knew it he would recite the numbers back to back. “I knew then he was keen on languages, so I showed him a video in Spanish. His eyes lit up, so I decided to buy him Spanish flashcards he absolutely loved these and would study them every day. “He loves that Japanese has a pattern. Once you learn numbers -, it’s very easy to learn the rest. Japanese numbers follow a logical pattern, with a few exceptions. “So, it’s a continuous repeat of the same word for dferent numbers. For example, number  is ‘ichi’ and number  is ‘juu’….. therefore, number  would be juu-ichi. “Because plus is . Simply place the  words together and you’ll have . There’s only a few exceptions. It’s so cool once you get the hang of it!” When Isaiah was just four-months old, Jazelle turned her living room into a numeracy and literacy environment so that Isaiah could benefit visually. When Isaiah was eight-months-old, Jazelle would ask him questions, ‘whereaposs the letter H  Or S  - then incredibly, Isaiah would point out the correct letters. Weeks after he would sound them out using phonics. Jazelle said: “I was first taken back and thought, did my eight-month-old just call out letters  I remember just laughing nervously but I was so excited and wanted to hear it again. “I thought maybe it sounded like he said the numbers and letters but he actually said something . But he continued to say it which confirmed what I thought. “I remember telling his dad when he got home from work I took Isaiah to the wall where the letter and number stickers were, when he called them out we both stood there just laughing. “We were first time parents and just felt so proud and excited.” The mum said she did think it was unusual but admitted she was overjoyed more than anything  - and noticed that her son was also excited. She added Isaiah enjoys having numbers in front of him and loves practising alone he has white boards, and pens to practise writing numbers every day. Jazelle said: “When I realised he was identying numbers and letters I bought him a pack of sight words. I actually placed them in a drawer and thought he wouldnapost be interested.  “But I started reading them to him, incorporating the phonics, and he showed interest in this and would flick through them “A while after this I thought to see how much he remembered, so I flashed a card and said “what does this say ”, to my surprise he got each one correct! “With multiplication, he would write numbers - on his board, he’d skip count by s, simply by missing out a number. This was and still is his favourite activity to do.” She added: “I recall one of his nursery teachers telling me that he sat with his friends and helped them learn their numbers. “She said his friends werenapost so confident, so Isaiah sat with them and would point out the numbers, asking them to repeat what he was saying. “She said how sweet it was to see, and how much he wanted everyone to learn with him. It was a moment I won’t forget. He was just over two at the time.” After turning one, Isaiah would air write letters before getting a doodle pad which he then wrote numbers on.Other parents didnapost believe Isaiah’s capabilities, so Jazelle began to document his learning through footage and share it on her popular Instagram page.Jazelle said you only have to see her son’s face when he is around numbers to realise that’s when he is at his happiest. The mum said: “I have had an amazing response from people. I’d say % of people have rooted for him and praised him along the way. “Some ask for tips and some just say how they find him amazing. However, I received a handful of people saying, ‘he’s just a kid, let him play, he shouldn’t be learning like this. “But what they don’t understand is, Isaiah wakes up and WANTS to learn. All of what you see is all child led. “He loves to ask so many questions and is so loving. He’s also very head strong and passionate about learning. It blows my mind because he is only two-years-old. “I have never had experience with a child like him, and I’m saying that with over  years experience in early years education. “We are currently on the hunt for an educational psychologist to assess Isaiah as we believe he is a child of high potential and upon research, could be gted. “It’s frustrating to know that some think I’m a pushy parent, but that can’t be further from the truth. Isaiah is unique, he finds learning extremely exciting, and perceives it as play. “He is happy and that’s all that matters to me!”Do you have a story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplc.Comment MORE ON Parenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Vet Ellie Chiswell spent three houses removing each and every pebbleEllie-May with the stones she ate Image: Stoke SentinelByBradley StokesChiara Fiorillo:,  Sep | commentsA greedy dog who wolfed down  rocks while on her daily walk is lucky to be alive, her owners said. Ellie-May, a one-year-old Labrador, was rushed to the vets for emergency surgery when her owners became worried she was ill. The family had gone for a walk in the woods near their home in Gnosall, Staffordshire, earlier this month when the dog gulped down the stones. The pooch was quickly transferred to Linnaeus-owned Shire Vets in Eccleshall, where she was promptly anaesthetised and examined. After undergoing an X-ray, the vets and owners were amazed to see Ellie-Mayaposs stomach was clogged with stones. Vet Ellie Chiswell spent three houses removing each and every pebble, and the dog has now made a full recovery.  She said: This was a pretty unique and remarkable case. We took a series of abdominal radiographs which demonstrated multiple stones within the stomach, with the size and number of stones making it a very unusual occurrence. Ellie-May promptly had an exploratory laparotomy , with an incision made into her small intestine to remove the large stones, and the rest of the intestine was checked to ensure no further stones.  The procedure was successful. All stones were removed and Ellie-May has now made a full and uneventful recovery. She spent a couple of weeks recuperating, with exercise on her lead only for the first week due to the size of her abdominal wound, with this exercise gradually increased as her recovery progressed and the wound healed.  Ellie-May has made a full recovery and has not swallowed anything but dog food since. Relieved owner Robert Price, , said: Ellie-Mayaposs as fit as a fiddle again now and weaposre hoping she has learned her lesson. She had swallowed  stones in total. I found seven when she vomited up her breakfast and she managed to pass one at the other end. I still took her straight to the vets, though, where they found a further three lodged in her stomach. Thankfully, we can look back on it now without any adverse effects but it could have been very serious, so weaposre grateful to Shires Vets for their expert help.

Annabel Wright, , was found dead in her bedroom just  minutes after chatting to her dad Simon Wright, with her family adamant she was not bothered by her skin condition and was happy before taking Roaccutane. Mum Helen Wright told the hearing on Wednesday she had not requested for her daughter to be switched from antibiotics and had read about two US teens who had died by suicide while on the acne medication. Annabel began taking the new prescription - in the form of Isotretinoin capsules - nine months before her death at the age of , after being referred by her GP to a dermatologist. Mrs Wright, , said her daughter was performing well at St Davidaposs School in Harrogate, Yorkshire, adding nothing ever bothered her.Have you been affected by this story  Let us know at webnews@mirror On July  , Mrs Wright and her daughter attended Church Lane Surgery in Boroughbridge for a routine review of her medication. She had suffered from acne since the age of  and had been on lymecycline antibiotics for a year. At the consultation, Mrs Wright said the GP, whom they had not seen before, referred Annabel to a dermatologist at Harrogate District Hospital, something the family had not asked for. The mum said they had not expected it as the teenaposs skin looked to be getting better, but they were pleased to be potentially coming off antibiotics. A letter from the GP - read out in the inquest - stated Annabelaposs skin was not improving, something her mum did not agree with but she took her for the hospital appointment on October   regardless. The consultant said she wanted the teenager on Roaccutane before she got any scarring, explained Mrs Wright. She was only  and it panicked her, she said. The family were given a leaflet which Annabel ticked boxes on and her mother signed. There was a warning that a number of side effects may occur but there are extremely rare. Mrs Wright said: There is nothing in there about suicide. Annabel was not depressed. I was told only children depressed about their skin might take their own lives.  When you sit opposite an expert in their field and they say aposYes, but it could be argued that these children were depressed about their acne - it sways you. I was not aware that sudden suicidal impulses could overcome a perfectly normal person. At the end of January , Mrs Wright noticed scratches on her daughteraposs wrists and she admitted she had begun self-harming. She said she just felt low. She could not explain why, her mum added. Mr Wright, , told the court he gave her a stern talking to about the risks of self-harming, followed by some love and affection. There were no other signs anything was wrong, the court heard. Mrs Wright agreed with the hospital reports that Annabelaposs treatment was progressing well and she hardly had any spots at all except while on monthly cycle. It was discussed that Annabel could switch to hyfication, a surgical procedure for removing lesions, but this never happened and her mother never asked why. On May , , at the final consultation before her death the same day, Annabel was told the treatment had been so successful her dosage would be reduced the next day. She was concerned this might cause the acne to , but she was reassured by her mum. The same evening, Annabel had a normal meal with her family before going up to her room to revise for a Spanish test. Her mother, grandmother, and  year old brother then went off to a young farmeraposs do. They asked Annabelshe wanted to come but she declined. Mr Wright came home later that evening and chatted to his daughter before she went to her room. He said: I would have noticedshe was crying or upset. It was just a nothing. When the rest of the family came home, Annabelaposs grandmother went upstairs to check on her and immediately called for Mr Wright. He said: I knew something was wrong. I ran upstairs. She was hanging there. I tried my best to resuscitate her. My son who was  at the time helped me. Askedthey believed there was a link between the acne medication and the daughteraposs death, both parents were convinced there was. Mrs Wright said: Absolutely. Normal, happy people do not just commit suicide without any sign or lead up to it. I have also been in touch with several other families who have lost children to this drug. There were no other injuries and toxicology tests for drugs and alcohol proved negative, the corners court in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, was told.

A home on the remote Isle of Eigg,  miles off the coast of Scotland, is a single room building needing a new occupant who is willing to fully immerse themselves in island le, alongside the  other residents. The converted shepherdaposs building, named Sandamhor Bothy, will need a lot of TLC and some extensive renovations, but is currently on the market for £, and comes with some land to boot. The island is owned by the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust who have managed it since a community buyout in . Ownership of Eigg was transferred to the islanders in a deal that saw £.m in funds raised.  The Trust has responsibility for stewardship of the island, its buildings and natural heritage, and for supporting future development. Prospective buyers have now been offered viewings of the bothy and a chance to live on Eigg on a full time basis. A sales brochure says: The plot enjoys easterly views across the seascape towards the Scottish mainland. Access is via a shared unsurfaced and rough access track. The building is stone built and contains a single room ided by a low wall. Water is supplied to an inside sink and outside toilet. There is currently a cast iron wood-burning stove installed in the property. The plot is subject to rules stopping it being used as a holiday or second home. Applications to buy the bothy will be closed on November . About five miles long by three miles wide, Eigg lies  miles off the Scottish west coast, south of the Isle of Skye. The island has a fascinating history, superb wildle and a vibrant community. The main industries on Eigg are tourism, agriculture, public services, construction and the creative industries. More than  years ago, every resident of Eigg, barring one elderly woman, was killed during a clan feud. Islanders, who were members of the Macdonald clan, were murdered by a raiding party of Macleods from Skye. The islanders had been hiding in a cave for three days when they were discovered.

As we continue to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, the NHS insist it is important for people to remain vigilant in the face of the disease and the booster is an important way of fighting it.

The NHS say currently that around four in five adults in England have received both doses of the vaccine, with  million doses administered overall since Maggie Keenan received the first dose outside a clinical trial in December . GP and deputy lead for the vaccination programme Dr Nikki Kanani, told NHS England : The vaccines are the best way to protect yourself, your family and friends as we head in to winter when we know Covid can present a bigger risk to our health.Now that the National Booking Service has opened to people eligible for a booster it’s time to book yourself in, it’s the quickest and most convenient way to book your jab in.

Over time, the young girl struck up a friendship with the petaposs -year-old owner, Keith, who began giving her lts to school and lavishing her with gts. With a dad who walked out on her while still young and a mum who worked around the clock to make ends meet, Jenny spent a lot of time alone and was grateful to know a friendly face. Aged , however, Keith started asking for sexual favours. It marked the beginning of a horric journey that saw the vulnerable teenager sold as a sex slave to forceful and violent men - and plied with booze and drugs. I realised it was wrong when he started to say Iaposve done this for you, what are you going to do for me  I said I didnapost want to, Jenny says now of her neighbouraposs sick abuse. He said it would only take a couple of seconds and I was special to him - and thathe was special to me and I appreciated what he did Iaposd have sex. I think from the first time thataposs when he felt he owned you or made his mark on you. Perv neighbour invited men to abuse young girl Horrendously abused for years, Jenny eventually reached out for help and called The Salvation Army, whose workers took her to a safe house within two hours and gave her invaluable support. Now, she is speaking out about her experience ahead of a skye with another survivor of modern slavery to raise money for the charitable organisation. Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersI got to know Keith when I went to primary school, she explains in a video. I was in Year Six, and he had a dog so on the way to school youaposd pet the dog. He was always around so it was just a good morning and a friendly face. It was just nice to have someone so interested. Heaposd invite you in the house for a drink and heaposd put his hand on your knee and it was uncomfortable, but it sort of progressed from there. Jenny explains she was afraid to tell her family about the abuse, and over time Keith demanded more and more aposfavoursapos.  One day, he told her he was in debt to other men, whom he began inviting over to his house to join in the vile abuse. Theyaposd offer you weed, theyaposd offer you drugs, theyaposd offer you alcohol, and they were a lot more forceful and violent, says Jenny. Theyaposd pass you around. The men would then bring their friends in and then the network got bigger. aposTrafficking steals your identityapos Addicted to the drug diazepam, Jenny left home aged  and stayed at a womenaposs refuge. However, after years of emotional abuse, she struggled to tear herself free from her tormentors.  I kept going back, she says. You can try and run away but trafficking almost steals your identity. So you become what theyaposve made you become. Thataposs all you feel worth so you go back because thataposs the only thing giving you purpose. Thankfully, after being put in touch with Victim Support by the police, she was told to ring The Salvation Army. The group provides specialist support for adult victims of modern slavery in England and Wales, working with a network of partners running safe houses and outreach support. If it wasnapost for that phone call, andit wasnapost for The Salvation Army, I wouldaposve been dead by now, says Jenny. They didnapost ask questions, they didnapost judge you, they didnapost put any pressure on you. You just felt free and safe.Have you been a victim of modern slavery and want to share your story  Get in touch by emailing alex.bellotti@reachplcJenny and Dan*, a fellow modern slavery survivor, are planning their jump on Sunday,  October, the day before Anti-Slavery Day – which aims to raise awareness of the plight of slavery survivors and the warning signs people can look out for.

Forced to sell drugs by aposthreateningapos bosses Dan was support by the organisation after bosses at a warehouse he was working at began forcing him to sell drugs - threatening his family and refusing to pay him for his long shts. When the police raided the warehouse, they realised he was a victim and took him to a safe house where The Salvation Army and its partners helped him to recover from his ordeal. Speaking about the groupaposs support, Dan says: “I was always treated with respect, honesty and integrity. I learned so much - from cooking skills to languages and other cultures - and their positive energy would instantly cheer me up whenever I felt down. They also helped me apply for work and my confidence grew under their care. Amazing people who deserve recognition. What an amazing service. I will forever be in their debt.”Kathy Betteridge, director of anti-trafficking and modern slavery for The Salvation Army, says: “We are so grateful to Jenny and Dan and in awe of their bravery in skying to raise vital funds for our work with modern slavery survivors.“Please do donate to support their jump via their Just Giving link, but you could consider taking the leap yourself to raise funds for The Salvation Army so that we can continue to help people who have gone through unimaginable experiences on their journey of recovery.” *Names have been changed To donate to the work of The Salvation Army support with modern slavery survivors and support Jenny and Dan in their skye click here.

An urban explorer, known as Urbex Muse, revealed her findings after wandering the home which she has dubbed “grandma’s house”.Items appear to be perfectly preserved despite being left to collect dust for decades, with books still left on the shelves and an old TV in seemingly perfect condition, according to the Daily Star. On the coffee table, there appears to be a tray with cutlery and a plate left out assomeone had just finished their dinner before the house was abandoned.A suitcase containing black and white photos of what appears to be weddings and servicemen from around World War One were also shown on Urbex Muse’s Instagram page. One photo appears to be of a triple wedding while another shows a handsome headshot of a man in a soldier’s unorm. The man in the unorm can also be seen in other pictures with a young woman, leading viewers to speculate he was the husband of the previous owner of the house. There also appears to be packets of unprocessed camera film left inside the suitcase.  This home was once bursting at the seams with memories of the old couple that resided here, Urbex Muse wrote in a caption alongside the images of the home. These reminders lingered in every corner, from the nicknacks they collected to the priceless antiques left behind. We even stumbled across grandmas original zucchini bread recipe, which I ended up making and can confirm is amazing.”  Social media users described the atmosphere of the home as “peaceful” and “heart-breaking”. One person commented: “The vibes in these abandoned granny houses is always so peaceful, you can feel the love and good memories tinged with the sadness that the family has left it all behind for whatever reason.” Another added: It kind of broke my heart to see everything left like that. Frozen in time. Like what happened  One event led up to them just leaving their home like that. Defiantly very cool. Thank you for respecting their home.”  A third said: It breaks my heart to think of the history and people that lived in these houses, home is something, like so intimate and full of personality, and then when the person is gone it turns into nothing, just a bunch of pieces in time and space.” Others askedthe explorer could try and find out what happened to the owners of the property. One person wrote: “Are you allowed to take things from abandoned places. like all those pics to find the right owner of them ” Another added: This is so sad, I have tons of pictures from my family even though I never met any of them, but we try to keep the stories that go to each picture so that it be passed down.

He explains why it’s such a good partnership for young farmers like himselfAdvertorialByLaura Tait:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep Tucked away in the Staffordshire hills is a -acre mixed beef, sheep and arable farm that has belonged to Richard Hopley and his family for the past  years. From their grass-fed cows and sheep, which are inspected annually by Red Tractor to ensure high farming standards, Richard is proud to supply Lidl with top-quality beef and lamb. And he knows that Lidl’s commitment to the best-quality produce will help him keep his own standards high. “We are on the same page – I feel that Lidl understands my farming business,” Richard says. “The company has a keen interest in how the produce is grown, with good feedback on what it wants to see in what it puts on its shelves. “We both want quality products, and Lidl is supporting British food that has been grown to high standards.”But as well as its focus on quality, Lidl also supports young farmers across the UK, and is committed to investing £billioninto British food and farming over the next five years. Through its Grassroots Dairy Partnership it is working with  young beef and dairy farmers across the UK to create sustainable businesses, with a particular focus on mitigating the impacts of climate change. One key goal, for example, is reducing the use of plastic across Lidl’s dairy range.“I like the fact that we have got a group of young farmers together,” says Richard. “It allows us to see how other people are operating and understand dferent ways of working. It feels like we’re part of something good.”  Richard’s farm has been in his family for three generations, and he still works with his father, Roger. He also hopes his young son, Matthew, will follow in his footsteps. By keeping it in the family, Richard is confident his farm will continue to keep the high farming standards they have always held. “Any cows housed in the winter are bedded on straw produced on the farm. That allows us to keep cosy beds for them,” Richard explains. “After winter the straw is used as fertiliser on the fields to feed next year’s crops and promote healthier soils. It’s all circular and balanced it’s why, in my opinion, mixed farming is the best way to farm sustainably.” The quality of Lidl’s beef reflects the care and attention that Richard and its other suppliers give to their cows. Indeed, one of the commitments of the Grassroots partnership is continual improvement of animal welfare, beyond national standards. “Our beef is not produced, it’s nurtured,” says Richard proudly. All of Lidl’s fresh chicken and beef is from British suppliers and is Red Tractor assured. “Red Tractor checks that we are doing everything to the highest possible standards, including animal welfare, environmental, quality, and health and safety aspects,” says Richard. “The inspector is there to check that we are doing everything right. “It’s great that they are coming out regularly to ensure we are doing things correctly.” FEED IT BACK IT’S not just British farmers that Lidl is supporting. Lidl has also been helping to tackle hunger in Britain’s communities through its Feed it Back scheme. Since , Lidl has been involved in donating food surplus to over , good causes such as food banks, community centres, and soup kitchens.Cereal - Soup - Pasta - Rice - Tinned tomatoes pasta sauce - Lentils, beans and pulses - Tinned meat - Tinned vegetables - Tea coffee - Tinned fruit - Biscuits - UHT milk - Fruit juice Lidl is working with its partner Neighbourly to ensure any donated food will be put to good use every day. Now customers can support the scheme. By buying a little bit extra with the weekly shop and putting it in the donation box found at the checkout in-store, they can help Lidl meet its target of donating  million meals a year to those in need.Find out more about how Lidl changes for the better."},{"url":null,"title":"junior doctor who worked covid","story":":root Junior doctor who worked on Covid frontline found dead after night swim with friendsThirushika Sathialingam, , was found dead on Margate seafront after a late-night swim with colleaguesTributes have been paid to Dr Thirushika SathialingamByLeonie Chao-Fong:,  Sep | commentsA junior doctor who worked on the Covid frontline died after going for a late-night swim with friends. Thirushika Sathialingam, known as Thiru to her friends, was found dead on Margate seafront in the early hours of Saturday September . She is understood to have gone swimming with colleagues, who sounded the alarm after noticing she was missing when they ed to their accommodation. A major search was launched at am involving leboat crews, police, firefighters and a coastguard rescue helicopter, and her body was discovered by RNLI volunteers a few hours later. Thiru, , had been working at the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospitalalongside her brother, Kaushaliyan, who is also a junior doctor. Kaushaliyan said: I donapost think many siblings were as close as we were. We did almost everything together.  She was a fantastic doctor. I donapost think she realised how good she was, but it came naturally to her. She was able to think outside the box to get things done for her patients, and she loved that medicine was such a complex subject. She was interested in anaesthetics because she enjoyed the scientic approach to it. She wanted to be able to do procedures that would make a real dference to people. Thiru was aspiring to follow in her father’s footsteps and become a consultant anaesthetist at the hospital.  Her father Sathialingam, who retired from the hospital in July, said she was “passionate” about her work and “always had time to listen to people”. He said: “During the second wave of Covid she was on a respiratory ward with people who had the virus and she would sit and talk to them, holding their hands to give them comfort.” She was also a talented dancer, performing classical Indian routines at charity events and teaching others. She loved travelling and would meticulously plan trips around the world and the UK. Her boyfriend, Peter Speilbichler, who she had met while studying medicine at Riga Stradins University in Latvia, said: I have had calls from my friendsapos parents who only met her once or twice, saying how amazing she was and how she lit up the room and made everyone welcome. If there was someone who was not part of a group, she would make sure she spoke to them and that they were included and felt comfortable. She could get on with everyone and she was always kind and smiling. I never heard anything malicious come out of her mouth, evenshe was angry. The time we spent together was amazing and I loved everything about her. East Kent Hospitalsapos chief executive Susan Acott said her death as a huge loss to the Trust, adding that she was a “real shining star” who was known for her “caring nature” and passion for her patients. She continued: “It is clear she would have had a bright future ahead of her and I have no doubt she had the potential to achieve anything she set her heart on.” Comment MORE ON IlfordQueen Elizabeth The Queen MotherHospitalsRoyal FamilyMental health\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

At that point non-essential businesses were required to keep their doors closed to the public.  The rule breaker hair trimmer was given  days to pay the fines and costs on August  after she was found guilty of ten charges relating to lockdown breaking activity in November . More than a month on she had not paid the fine, leading Kirkless Council to warn that bailfs may be sent in. A council spokesperson said: The court is responsible for recovering the fine and enforcementnecessary. Miss Quinn raised more than £, from supporters who donated to a Go Fund Me page after her battle with the authorities went public. On setting up the fund, she wrote: By no means do I think the council will be successful in trying to extort money from me.

Louise Carter, , from Gilberdyke, East Yorkshire, says she begged doctors to test her for sepsis after self-diagnosing her symptoms on Google.The mum-of-three had been experiencing back pain, which she dismissed as discomfort from sitting on the sofa to type during lockdown. But, in August last year she was rushed to Scunthorpe General Hospital when she could no longer handle the searing pain. She was unable to urinate and soon started vomiting, hallucinating, and running a high fever. After several days without answers, the social worker Googled her symptoms and became convinced she had sepsis. The le-threatening ailment is caused by the immune system damaging body tissue while trying to react to an infection. Despite crying and begging doctors to test her for blood poisoning, she claims they refused and denied any possibility of her having the illness. Fearing she survived a close call with death, Louise has spoken out to alert others to sepsis symptoms, and to urge people to follow their gutthey think they have it. She said: I had really bad back pain and thought it was because of working from home during the pandemic and sitting on the sofa typing all day. I could barely move because of the pain and couldnapost go to the toilet either so I rang my doctor and he told me to ring an ambulance. They took me to AE in Scunthorpe Hospital. I was really poorly and out of it. After a couple of days of being in hospital I started projectile vomiting, having hallucinations and was shivering but sweating at the same time. I told the doctor I think itaposs sepsis and she said itaposs not, she said my blood pressure was normal but I asked her to check my stats again.I was furious and crying because I knew something was wrong. I had to push for them to test me for sepsis and keep telling them that I had all the symptoms. They did more bloods and the next morning two doctors came to see me and said it was sepsis. The mum-of-three spent two and a half weeks in hospital fighting the deadly condition and dealing with terrying symptoms. Thinking she was on her death bed, she asked for her three children Connor, , Kiah, , and Kadi,  to be allowed to visit despite Covid- restrictions on visitors at the time.  Louise said: When I went to AE they just put a catheter in because they thought it was something wrong with my bladder as I couldnapost wee. I started being sick and didnapost eat or drink for a few days. Iaposm not ever sick even when Iaposve drank too much. I have an iron stomach, so I knew something wasnapost right. Then I started having hallucinations - I saw one of my dead friends and a nurse peeping round the curtains in the room but the healthcare worker kept telling me no one was there. It was really scary. I was crying and askingsomething was wrong with me. They shouldaposve recognised that I had the symptoms and done a blood culture test straight away.  When they told me I had sepsis I askedit was a good idea to get my family to visit me because I know how serious sepsis is and they said yes - I thought it must be badthey will let me have visitors during the pandemic. Louise made a full recovery after being treated with antibiotics but fears it could have turned out dferentlyshe hadnapost pushed doctors to test her. She had to use a Zimmer frame for a week after leaving hospital because of struggling to walk from the back pain she suffered but this soon passed once she fully recovered from her ordeal. The mum now hopes to raise awareness about the deadly condition and to encourage more people to speak up when they believe their symptoms arenapost being acknowledged. Louise said: I feel really lucky to have not even lost a fingertip or anything because people pass away or lose limbs from sepsis. Itaposs really important to raise awareness about sepsis because it affects so many people but thereaposs not much out there about it. Iaposm nearly  and I didnapost know the symptoms until I Googled them and realised I had it. If you believe you have sepsis you need to push to get blood cultures done. A spokesperson for the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust said: “Timely treatment of patients with Sepsis is vital so we make sure all patients showing symptoms are screened. In cases like this where patients are staying in hospital they are monitored regularly and,any changes are noted, our staff can take action quickly to start treatment so they can recover fully. We would invite this patient to contact our PALS teamthey have any concerns about their care and treatment so we can discuss it directly with them.

That’s why one mum has considered getting her children dressed for the day ahead before they go to bed, but she’s worried her thought process is “mad”.According to the Liverpool Echo, the mum posted to Mumsnet about her dilemma, where she explained she has four children – two of whom have additional needs – and that getting them all ready for school each morning is a nightmare.She wrote: “I have four children. Oldest two have additional needs, so need a lot of help with dressing in the mornings, which can take a long time. Younger two just need help due to their age.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. “The mornings are hectic, and between getting myself and the four of them ready, it can take a very long time to get out of the house! “We also need to get a bus, so we miss it sometimes when we haven’t got out on time .” To try and help with her plight, the woman referred to a news article she had read about another mum who dresses her children the night before, and said she considered following that woman’s advice. She added: “I read a news article a little while ago about a woman who says she dresses her children for school the night before! Now I know people will just say go to bed earlier, but my oldest doesn’t sleep at night so we are currently awaiting a referral for a paediatrician. “Am I being unreasonable to consider what this woman does  Would anyone do this  Or am I mad to consider it ” The mum was met with hundreds of responses from other Mumsnet users, many of whom told her it was “gross” to send her kids to school in clothes they had slept in. One person wrote: “No. Theyaposd be so uncomfortable to start with. They will also smell. Not washing in the morning or changing out of clothes they may have sweated in overnight. “It just isn’t a solution. You need to get up earlier.” While another said: No, normal people donapost do this. Iaposm afraid this is definitely not the solution to your morning problems . Someone  tried to be more helpful with their comment, as they wrote: What do you already do - what’s the routine  Posters can help troubleshoot. “I don’t think I could send my children to school in slept-in clothes and I think it doesn’t give them good habits to build off for the future - plusthey mentioned sleeping in their clothes I’m sure school would log that as a concern. And after reading through some comments, the mum insisted she wouldn’t be going through with the plan to send her kids to bed fully clothed. She said: I’m not going to do it, I was just desperate to make the mornings easier but I will try some of these ideas. “Thanks for the supportive comments I am reading them and taking the advice on board. “The oldest is  and she does not sleep till  or am most nights. She shouts, screams, gets out of bed and wonders around – my youngest cannot share a room with her because she is aggressive, so my four-year-old is still in my bed. “None of us get much sleep because she keeps the other ones up with her noise, so my other children aren’t going to bed till late either as they are repeatedly being woken up. She doesn’t struggle to get out of bed, she seems to cope fine on her limited sleep, but it’s the others who struggle where they have been kept up all night.

Since then, the problems in their home have only worsened. Trisha said: “We complained about sewage problems again on September , and were told someone would come and check the blockage, but they did not. “When the emergency contractor came out, he said the blockage appeared to be baby wipes which could be anyone on the street due to our drainage line.

The couple attempted to stop the flood of excrement from spreading too far into their house by using towels, but their efforts still saw it flood into their hallway and kitchen. Trisha added: “Our children were coming down from their bath when my partner saw it seeping into the hallway, the kitchen, the front room and on the stairs carpet. “We immediately tried to stop the flood of excrement with all our bath towels. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.“Our children were crying and upset because they didnapost understand why they couldn’t come downstairs and they had to be evacuated to their grandparents immediately because of bacteria. “I was physically sick down myself trying to stop the flow through the house. “Our children had to leave the house for three days after staying with family whilst we tried to sort the house.” Trisha claims she complained to Persimmon homes about the mess, who conducted a deep clean as a gesture of goodwill, but she claims there is faeces still on the floor. She claims the firm offered to replace the flooring in her bathroom, but not in any of the other faeces-soaked rooms. She added: I’m absolutely exhausted by the worry for our children, let alone the fact that you don’t expect to have to manage in unsanitary conditions when buying a new-build property. “Both kids were covered in a rash days after, I could not eat in the house because I felt so disgusted by the smell. “I have had to personally clean the floors, walls and skirting boards with alcohol fluid but as best as we have tried, it is still vile now.” A spokesperson for Persimmon Homes said: “We always aim to address our customers’ concerns in a timely manner. “Contractors have visited the property of the customer to find there was no problem with the street’s drainage. “The toilet blockage was caused by baby wipes and a large amount of tissue. “We are also satisfied that no drainage from other houses has entered the customer’s premises as the drainage run on the street was clear. “We will continue to liaise with the customer and we are committed to resolving any outstanding issues.” Comment MORE ON Maternity rightsFloods\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In these instances, I just nod at any question Iaposm asked, even though I donapost know what theyaposre about.  Being deaf has caused Margaret to have high levels of anxiety. She said: I try to avoid people I know as my anxiety will kick in ... knowing itaposs going to be a struggle to hear anyone. I also get embarrassedI donapost hear what people say and basically donapost go out unless I need to now. On top of that, I canapost use the phone to make or receive calls, I donapost hear the door and, frankly, I donapost sleep well at night because of it. Margaret has also had issues in the past with her home le because of her deafness. She said: Iaposve had neighbours report me for having my television on too loud at times. Being deaf is a very lonely, quiet le and itaposs not great, but it is what it is.She added: I am one of many who suffer with hidden disabilities. We all struggle, but itaposs even more frustrating that this is happening at doctors appointments. Margaret says her latest experience has left her scared to go to any medical appointment as sheaposs worried her anxiety will flare up and she will be unable to hear the doctors and nurses. Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has now reportedly apologised to Margaret. Chief Executive Dr Peter Reading said: “I would like to send my sincere apologies to this patient for her experience which really should not have happened. We offer support to hearing impaired patients in several ways, including clear masks and a range of communication and interpretation tools, including British Sign Languageinterpreters and live transcribing. We also have clear visors available as an option for staff too. We will be reminding our staff of what is available to them in these circumstances. I’m aware this patient has already contacted our Patient Advice and Liaison team about this and we are reviewing this case with the relevant department.” Comment MORE ON HospitalsMental health\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mum-of-two, from Quinton, who had tested positive for coronavirus, travelled the five-minute journey straight to Selly Oak hospital amid fears she could no longer feel the baby at am on July .When she was eventually brought in to the hospital at .pm she underwent an emergency C-section, but sadly her baby was stillborn. Mrs Nikolli claims a doctor said to her: If you had came in before, I could have saved the baby.  Almost three months later, the mum of two boys said she has heard nothing from the hospital - and is still awaiting answers on the tragedy. But after being approached by BirminghamLive, the Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS Foundation Trust apologised to Mrs Nikolli and said a probe is underway. The Trust also said it had made immediate changes and improvements to how they manage pregnant women with Covid-. But that is small comfort to Mrs Nikolli, who claims her doctor had examined her the day before the death and had said her baby was healthy. She said: If they had taken me in hospital before, maybe the baby would still be alive. I went with Covid, I called the hospital, I said: aposI want to come because I donapost feel the babyapos. They said: aposYes comeapos and when I got to the hospital, they left me two and a half hours in the car park. Despite pleading with medics that it was an aposemergencyapos, she claims she was told to wait until the hospital had found a separate room, isolated from other patients. She recalled: I said to them aposI canapost feel the baby, you need to bring me inside the hospital straight away and donapost leave me in car parkapos. Iaposd stayed in the car park because they said I could not come inside as I waspositive. They said they needed to find one room for me. I waited outside the hospital two hours and a half and when I got inside, I waited for minutes. She continued: When the doctor came to visit, he said: aposHeaposs still alive but the heart is too slowapos. The doctor said he would do the Caesarean in  minutes but aposit is too late to save the baby,you came inside before, I could save the baby, but itaposs too late nowapos. And I did lose my baby. She continued: When I gave birth, when I lost the baby and I came out from the surgery, they said: aposYour baby is stillbornapos.  They told me I should come see the baby. I told them I didnapost want to, I wasnapost prepared for this. The mum says she had a normal pregnancy up until the tragedy, with her GP saying the baby was healthy just the day before. All my pregnancy was fine, she said. On July  I visited with the GP and they said your baby is very healthy, you are very well, his heart is very, very well. I canapost understand why this happened... just in one day  After the stillbirth, the mum was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital next door to be cared for as the oxygen in her blood was too low due to Covid-. She is now awaiting answers as to what caused the tragedy. I asked the hospital to do the autopsy and they said we need to wait three months, she said.I donapost know anything at the moment, Iaposm waiting. Iaposve called them many times, to know something. Maybe it was because I was positive for coronavirus, I donapost know. Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS Foundation Trust said a full investigation was underway and apologised to the mum. Dr Fiona Reynolds, the Chief Medical Officer at Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, said: “We offer our sincere apologies and condolences to Fationa and her family. We were not able to be there for her in the way we would want or expect. “We have made a number of immediate changes and improvements to how we manage COVID positive women should we experience an increase or surge in attendances to ensure all women and babies are cared for safely. A full investigation into what happened is progressing to enable us to understand why Fationa’s baby died andanything could have been done dferently to avoid this devastating outcome. “We aim for all investigations to involve the family at the centre of care to ensure their voices are heard.

A summary of the case outlines the timeline of ‘Miss A’s’ pregnancy, from when she found out she was pregnant whilst in police custody, in February of  to when she was remanded to HMP Bronzefield, on  August . Shortly after her arrival in the cells a midwe in prison determined that Ms A was  weeks pregnant, which would make her expected delivery date from  September to  October.  While this was earlier than originally expected, the midwe did not recalculate this. Ms A was said to have engaged “minimally or not at all” with the midwe team and all antenatal care, including refusing to attend appointments for scans. In September, Ms A told a nurse that she would kill herself or someone her baby was taken away from her after birth a comment that prompted the nurse to discuss with an officer on duty whether it would be necessary to begin Prison Service suicide and self-harm monitoring. While they decided against this, Ms A was put on ‘extended observationsapos by the deputy head of healthcare on September . This meant she should have been checked by a nurse a minimum of twice during the day and twice at night. However, this did not happen. Ms A rang her cell bell shortly after pm that evening and asked for a nurse, though she did not say why. The officer who took the call handed over the information to a colleague, who spoke to Ms A on the phone but cannot remember the conversation.  “No nurse was called for Ms A. . Ms A pressed her cell bell again at .pm. The call was not answered on the house block and was erted to the permanently staffed communications room,” the report continued. “At .pm the call was connected and immediately disconnected. Ms A did not press her cell bell again.” Ms A’s cell was checked twice over the course of the night, but neither of the officers who carried out these checks noticed anything untoward, including blood, in her cell. It wasn’t until .am the next morning that an officer investigated and discovered Ms A had given birth during the night. Shortly after am paramedics confirmed her baby had died. Ms A was taken by ambulance to ASPH and ed to the prison that evening, where she was placed in the prison’s inpatient unit. The pathologist was unable to determine whether Baby A was born alive or was stillborn. The report outlined how the teenager “appeared to have been regarded as dficult and having a ‘bad attitude’ rather than as a vulnerable -year-old, frightened that her baby would be taken away”. Prisons and Probation ombudsman Sue McAllister told thethat Ms A should never have been left in a position where she was forced to give birth alone without medical assistance. The director of HMP Bronzefield called the incident “tragic and extremely sad”. “We are deeply sorry that this happened and our thoughts throughout have been with the family. In the two years which have passed, we have cooperated fully with the PPO investigation,” she said.Dr Kate Paradine, CEO of the charity Women in Prison,in  pleaded thatall mothers should have the right to give birth in dignity.She said: “But time and time again, we hear of situations where this isn’t happening, with mothers regularly being denied access to the vital health and maternity care necessary to give birth safely. This has devastating consequences not only for the baby and mother, but also for the rest of the family they are separated from. She added: Many mothers are imprisoned for being homeless, not having money to pay their bills and not having access to adequate mental health care and substance misuse support. Instead of sending these women to prison, the government needs to urgently prioritise investment in community support services like women’s centres, housing and health care.  Deputy prime minister and justice secretary, Dominic Raab also commented on the incident, which he said was “harrowing and unacceptable”. “We have already implemented the recommendation in the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman’s report. We have put in place important improvements to the care received by women in custody, and across government we must make sure that expectant mothers in prison get the same support as those in the community,” he said.Publication of the report has prompted the organisation of apetitionby organisations Level Up, Women In Prison and Birth Companions, calling for an end to the imprisonment of pregnant women. The groups’ calls have been echoed by the Royal College of Midwives and academics in the field.

The Duke of York now officially has  days to respond to legal documents which accuse him of having sex with Virginia Giuffre. The alleged sexual assaults took place at the behest of infamous billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein at properties in London, New York, and the US Virgin Islands. Ms Giuffreaposs lawyer, David Boies, says the prince - who is the Queenaposs second son - has accepted he is in possession of the papers.  The next legal step for the Duke is to ask for a reasonable extension of time to respond to Ms Giuffreaposs complaint. Mr Boies told the Daily Mail: Andrewaposs counsel have agreed that service has been made. Theoretically the clock is now ticking. However, it would be normal for them to ask for, and for us to agree to, a reasonable extension of time to respond to the complaint. A legal filing seen by the US publication also confirmed the documents had been served to the princeaposs lawyer, Andrew Brettler in Los Angeles.A source close to Andrew has claimed that despite his inner circle’s “deep reservations” that his “wall of silence” legal strategy was not working, he has decided to “keep faith and stay loyal” to his UK lawyer Gary Bloxsome of Blackfords.Royal insiders claimed that although the Duke has been stressed and worried over his predicament after Ms Giuffre accused him of sexually assaulting her three times in , the serving of legal papers effectively meant he had run out of time to change course. However, his newly appointed US attorney Andrew Brettler has now taken over the Duke’s case after being appointed just weeks ago. A source claimed the US team were “astonished” at the long held strategy of “no comment” employed by the Duke and his team as he became engulfed in sex abuse allegations by alleged former Jeffrey Epstein sex slave Virginia Giuffre. Another source close to Andrew said: “The Duke remains confident in his legal team and its strategy and is perfectly content to continue to follow their advice.”Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He now has  days to file a response, or risk a judgement by defaultJudge Kaplan considers the evidence brought by Giuffre compels him to do so in the absence of the princeaposs own evidence.As the case is now live, the massive immediate impact of the prince’s acceptance of the suit is not on the prince himself, however. If he contests the suit - which now seems very likely given his army of legal retainers - some experts have said the suit may take five years to reach a conclusion. That’s a long way off, and Andrew has already been living for almost two years behind palace gates with his spoiled dog.Its real weight now bears on the Palace, and particularly the long shadow of five years of legal skirmishes in the headlines. Is it proper for a member of the Royal Family to continue to retain their HRH title while a lawsuit proceeds against them  This is uncharted territory at best, as the prince is adamant that he has no case to answer and has consistently and strenuously denied Giuffreaposs accusations for as long as she has made them. Even so, appearing in court to contest an allegation is a grave matter in its own right. The Queen as head of state must surely rise above any reproach, and doubtless so should all HRHs in the Royal Family. Now that both sides in the suit agree papers have been served, it is dficult to see how the Palace can fail to insist that the prince relinquishes his HRH title to avoid any appearance of the monarchyaposs entanglement with a private matter that affects the prince only.

She added she disliked how the Duke of Sussex is has continued to speak about his family despite leaving the institution. Ms Widdecombe did not hold her feelings back about the royal couple.She told Express : On a more serious note, I think Harry is very damaging to the royals, he must be personally very hurtful to the Queen.And I think they should keep quiet, I mean they are privileged beyond belief and they moan that they were cut off financially.

They are privileged, they are professional victims, they are professional whingers and having said that they wanted privacy theyaposve done nothing except publicise every last detail of le.It comes as reports have suggested the Sussexes are keen to visit the UK after quitting as senior royals and moving to Calornia early last year.Harry has only ed to the UK twice since the move, while Meghan and two-year-old Archie have not been back so far.Meanwhile, Harry and Meghanaposs newborn daughter Lilibet has not been to the UK after being born in Calornia in June and is yet to meet her great-grandmother the Queen or her grandfather Prince Charles.And according to Katie Nicholl, a royal expert and author of Harry And Meghan: Le, Loss, And Love told Closer magazine : Christmas is being looked at as an opportunity. There may be a softening, which could pave the way for a healing of the family rt.It’s certainly what the Queen wants. Prince Charles would like to see his grandchildren. A meet-up suggests they hope to move on and sort things out. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex spoke to Oprah Winfrey in March and made a series of claims about the family - including one member reportedly speculating about what colour Archieaposs skin would be and how the palace allegedly failed to support Meghan when she struggled with her mental health. Since then, Harry has done his own interviews where he has spoken about his struggles growing up as a member of the Royal Family.

Musician Fred Sweenie, who has previously played for the Queen, is struggling with his mental health as a result of the issue.The Royal musician from Burntwood once had his property valued by an agent, but was told that the next door house would knock off at least £, from the value of his home.The semi-detached house next door is so overgrown that sunlight is blocked out and the giant trees mean his family cannot enjoy their garden, Staffordshire Live reports.He says that he has spotted rats running around his garden, and that he will never be able to sell his house as potential buyers will be put off by the state of the property next door.  These issues have left him feeling that his country is letting me down, and he is frustrated that for twelve years, nothing has been done to help his situation. Mr Sweenie played in the RAF Central band for  years and has performed at events including garden parties for the Queen and the Cenotaph in London. He has also toured with former Yes keyboardist, Rick Wakeman. The musician and his we Janet, , and son Guy, , have been complaining about the property to Lichfield council for over a decade, and state that no one has occupied the property for  years.  He said: Every time we try to do something it gets blocked. We donapost know why. We first moved into the property in Rugeley Road in . At the time, next door was well kept and well maintained. This really started to go wrong around  years ago. Our first complaint was around  years ago. It came about after we heard a humming noise coming from next door. We enquired and it turned out the wiring was archaic which led us to be worried about a possible fire hazard. Mr Sweenie added: By , the garden next door was having a serious impact on our health and wellbeing.  Rats had started to appear in our garden and we could see the holes where they were coming in. We reported it to environmental health. No response there. So we went to Mr Fabricantwho was fantastic. He wrote numerous times to the council requesting a full investigation into the property. When they did undergo a full investigation, they said that the property was occupied and that, apart from one shed that was full of food waste that had to be knocked down, there was no need to do anything . It made me very ill and we dropped the inquiries in . I was getting nightmares. That was the worst time I think. The house combined with the rats and the fact that we get no light in our garden because of the towering trees really made me ill. All of these issues have meant thathe ever chooses to sell the property, it will be listed for £, less than it is actually worth because of the nightmare garden next door. Head of corporate services at Lichfield District Council Tracey Tudor said: When investigating this type of neighbourhood complaint we need to establish that the condition of land or buildings is harmful to the area, which is not straightforward.  Having visited the garden on Rugeley Road a number of times, we have found that, although is overgrown, it has a clear path from either end, has plants rather than weeds, and is not covered in litter or dumped items. The owner has told us that he likes his plants and trees to attract wildle. While the garden may not be to everyone’s taste, we do not believe it breaches any planning laws that govern complaints of this nature, and when comparing it to similar cases. While some of the neighbours may not like the garden, others do as it does as it attracts birds. Although there is a dference of opinion about how back gardens should be presented, there are insufficient grounds for us to serve a notice. According to Lichfield council, the next door neighbour has agreed to cut back on some vegetation this month as a compromise.

Claire Stephanie Riley, , spent just £ to complete the magical look. The Royal Mail cleaner had help from her partner Jamie, , as they embarked on the project to make the home they bought two years ago about the things we love. Just like Hogwarts, the tiny bathroom features magical knick-knacks from top-to-bottom. It showcases the Marauderaposs Map on the walls to ensure occupants get their mischief managed. Claire, who also owns a dog grooming business, also displays her collection of wands, newspaper clippings from the movie franchise and miniature buildings from the fantasy world.  Even the soap and hand towels are Harry Potter-themed, with cuddly Harry and Hedwig toys looking back at you from the heated towel rail. Claire, from Wigan, said: I have always loved Harry Potter from the beginning. Itaposs just so magical it takes you to another world. Bogwarts came about when I found the Harry Potter wallpaper in BM. Not only is our downstairs loo done in Harry Potter but also our hallway that leads to it.  “My partner Jamie and I moved in around two years ago and we decided to make our home about things we love. “We donapost have any children, this is all for us... but when my friends come they love it… say itaposs their favourite place to go to the loo in. “We were having the house completely done up and we just thought for the downstairs loo and hallway it would be fun and we just came up with the name Bogwarts. “Lots more have been added over the months, more wands and other bits... itaposs something you can add on to as you go along.”  Claire also decoupaged her toilet roll holder with a dferent Harry Potter wallpaper and playing cards that she had lying around the home. Additionally, she put together a D collage of film memorabilia, including a Howler and a dark mark sign from hama beads, which is glued to the sink unit. Those with arachnophobia may want to avoid Bogwarts though, as thereaposs also a giant model of the filmaposs spider Aragog.  Claire added: “I made the toilet roll holder from bits of wallpaper we had left and Harry Potter playing cards and a few Harry Potter bits I had collected along the way. “I also made the D Harry Potter collage that hangs in the bathroom. The shelves are from IKEA and are great for putting things on and hanging other bits off. “The rest of the bits are what I have picked up and found along the way.” It isnapost the only room in the house with a theme.

Nikky Afo claims she was horried when the grey blob flopped out the plant-based product. She shared the vile discovery on TikTok leading some viewers to promise they will never become vegan. The video, which has gone viral with .million views and counting, started with the caption: Aldi can you explain this  The womanaposs family can be heard howling in the background as cuts the almond milk carton to show the oyster-looking contents. A voiceover says: Aldi UK, we need answers. You will never believe what we found inside this almond milk carton. She then points out the use-by date, which is February , . The woman says: Look at this, holding the cartonaposs lid which is covered with gross-looking grey and blue mould. She continues: I just opened this and I could tell that there is something lumpy inside it. The woman explains how she can feel the blob sloshing in the packaging, before taking a pair of kitchen scissors to cut the carton open. She adds: Honestly, I always buy this milk but now I feel like throwing up everything I have had in the last year. Her family then bursts into nervous giggles as she tells them: Itaposs not funny honestly! As the grotesque blob emerges, another woman shrieks and runs back from the now-open carton. Nikky Afo also posted another video, showing the rank blob up close as she prods it with scissors. In the video, a voiceover explains: Aldi UK, we need answers. We bought this almond milk from the store and when my daughter wanted to make oats this is what she saw. It is still within the expiry date.

Sarah Cardwell, , went in for an opticians appointment in November , after suffering with blurred vision. The mum-of-two, who is working with the charity Brain Tumour Research, is now speaking out about her le-threatening ordeal in aid of National Eye Health Awareness Week. Sarah, who works at Leeds Beckett University, said she noticed in the summer of  that her vision was blurred - so thought she probably needed new prescription glasses.I only wore glasses for driving at the time,” she told Leeds Live.  “I kept telling myself to make an optician’s appointment but with a busy job and two young daughters, le got in the way and I kept putting it off. Finally, in November that year, Sarah booked an appointment at Specsavers in Guiseley, where an optometrist did a series of tests and tried, to no avail, to seeher sight was improved with ious dferent strengths of corrective lenses. Sarah was then told she was being referred to eye casualty at the hospital. Accompanied by her husband, Sarah went to the hospital the same day, where an ophthalmologist took a photo of the back of her eye and carried out a colour-blindness test. Sarah, who is mum to Lucy,  and Ellie, seven, said: “I didn’t get a single one right. He then asked lots of questions about whether I got tired easily and whether I had noticed any other unusual symptoms. When I thought about it, I had been prescribed iron tablets for anaemia and had also suffered some sickness and dizziness.  I had also been to the doctors with severe headaches but I thought they were probably due to being tired and over-stretched with a busy work and home le.Sarah was referred for an MRI scan that took place on  December . The scan revealed a ‘cyst’ on her brain and she was asked to go back the following day for another MRI.The following week, Sarah met a neurosurgeon who said he thought the mass was a craniopharyngioma, sitting on her optic nerve. She was advised that the surgeon wanted to operate the following day.She broke the news to her children that they wouldn’t see their mum for the next couple of days, as she would be in hospital undergoing surgery. “Luckily, they weren’t fazed at all. I, on the other hand, broke down,” Sarah said. The thought of possibly not seeing them again was just too much. I didn’t want to go to bed that night and I think I only managed about one hour’s sleep.” The operation lasted five hours and they went in through the sinus, meaning it was less invasive than conventional brain surgery. She was discharged on  December, in time to spend Christmas with her family. Sarah said: “The results of my first post-op MRI scan were in February and showed that things were stable. My next routine scan was due in December . However, in June, fate stepped in and I woke up one weekend with a tingling sensation in my eye. It felt all too familiar. Deep down I knew the tumour was back but I didn’t want to believe it.” Devastatingly, Sarah’s instinct was right and doctors confirmed she’d suffered a relapse of her tumour. On  July , she underwent a second brain surgery to treat the regrowth.Sarah said: “The operation seemed to go well and once again I stayed in hospital for five nights. This time, however, after being discharged from hospital, I suffered a cerebrospinal fluidleak and I contracted meningitis.I had to be re-admitted and have two further surgeries to fix the leak, which was a really gruelling experience.” Sarah is now having annual MRI scans and her tumour remains stable. She’s now sharing her brain tumour experience, to help encourage people to be aware of their eye health and to get checked upsomething seems wrong.  She said: “I put off going to the optician for ages. Now, I’m much more aware that a problem with your eyesight might be an indication of something serious. With hindsight, I wish I’d gone to Specsavers sooner. I’ve no doubt that that routine check-up saved my le. “Without my urgent appointment, my brain tumour diagnosis may have come too late and the consequences don’t bear thinking about. National Eye Health Awareness week takes place from  to  September and aims to inspire and educate people on the importance of eye health and why they should go for regular sight tests. Brain Tumour Research funds sustainable research at dedicated centres in the UK. It also campaigns for the Government and the larger cancer charities to invest more in research into brain tumours in order to speed up new treatments for patients and, ultimately, to find a cure.To make a donation to Brain Tumour Research, click here Comment MORE ON SpecsaversPrescriptions\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Leighane Redmond, , had been suffering from psychosis when she and Melsadie Parris died at Taplow Station, on  February .British Transport Police said at the time they were treating the case as murder-suicide and the results of their investigations were expected to be revealed when the full inquest takes place,Bucks Free Press reports.At a pre-inquest review hearing held at Beaconsfield Coroners’ Court today, Buckinghamshire Senior Coroner Crispin Butler agreed to requests from lawyers for Melsadie’s father Leroy Parris and her mother Yvette Redmond to adjourn the full inquest hearing. The hearing was due to last four weeks from November . No new date for the full inquest was set, but there will be a pre-trial review on November .  The court today heard of how the death of Ms Redmond and her daughter could have been the result of inadequate fencing and hoardings at Taplow Station. Ms Redmond’s mother wants to invite a rail expert to help establish whether her daughter was let down by rail and contractor firms that were operating at the station on the day of her death. Yvette Redmond’s lawyer, Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, told the court she was concerned the other parties would “mark their own homework” when assessing what happened on the day of the tragedy. “It is essential to have an expert,” Ms Gallagher said.  “There are ious standards on the railway. Without expert assistance, it will not be possible to knowthe interested parties adhered to their responsibilities.” The lawyer said it was crucial to have an independent assessment. The comments come after the family of the victims raised concerns over the fencing and hoardings at Taplow Station, which was undergoing construction works when the incident took place. Questions were also raised at a previous pre-inquest review as to why station staff did not interfere when Ms Redmond, who had struggled with mental health issues, had been standing with her daughter on the  for more than an hour. Ben Compton QC, representing MTR Elizabeth Line raised questioned over whether there was a need for a rail expert in the matter. “I just question how much a pure rail expert can really help in this case. The question is how Leighane and Melisade were able to access the high-speed  in Taplow Station,” he said. The hearing had been adjourned after around two hours. Another pre-inquest review was expected to take place ahead of the full four-week inquest later this year.  The Samaritans is available  you need to talk.

Victoria said: “It was always my dream to create my own wedding dress, I got to make it to my own specications, and it was super comfortable.  I was inspired by a few dferent crochet artists but I made the dress entirely by hand, I didn’t have a pattern for it. “With the off-cuts left over from the yarn, I managed to make myself some barefoot sandals for the day, my husband’s tie and pocket square.

The town of Rockport in Utah, US, disappeared completely in  - five years after the White House green lit the construction of the Wanship Dam.At the time, a total of  families still lived in the once thriving little town, located in a narrow part of Weber Valley at the mouth of Three Mile Canyon, reports the Daily Star. The remaining residents protested against the development but the government went ahead and purchased the entire valley, and in preparation for the dam, created the Rockport Reservoir, quickly submerging the whole community.Last week, drone test pilot Devon Dewey shared incredible snaps on Twitter following a serious drought which revealed the foundations of the old town. Do you have any drone images to rival Devonaposs  Let us know at webnews@mirrorHe told KSL News : It was really interesting to be standing at an overlook for the reservoir and to see faint traces of foundations of old homes and a road all below where the water would normally be. The whole area is pretty flat and unorm, so even though the foundations are old and mostly gone, you can still see them clearlyyou know where to look.Using a drone to get a higher perspective helped to see where structures once stood over  years ago.  The town was first settled in . After the government purchased the land nearly a hundred years later, some of the buildings were removed so that they could be preserved for history. They were moved to Pioneer Village at Lagoon Amusement Park in Farmington. Following this year’s drought, only small boats and personal watercraft are allowed to launch, although officials have advised people to do so “at your own risk”. Even though water levels have declined, the ground may be muddy from years of being underwater, so officials have advised people to be cautious and use dronesthey want to see the remnants of the ‘ghost town’.

A poor little Golden Retriever puppy, called Millie, only wanted to be included in her big sisters’ fun and games, but the little tyke struggled to get their attention due to her small stature.The clip, which was posted by the TikTok user @missygoldenretrievers, begins with Millie trying to get the attention of her much bigger sisters, who are busy play fighting, by jumping all over one of them.The puppy then attempts to get involved by biting at her sister’s leg, but this proves to not be enough to distract the larger dogs from their ongoing battle with one another.  Eventually, Millie resorts to jamming her face right into the middle of where her big sisters are attempting to bite at each other, before ing to her early tactic of leg nibbling. Sadly, Millie is unable to get the inclusion she is after this time, as her tiny frame simply doesn’t yet have the necessary size to get the attention she wants from her sisters. Viewers clearly felt sorry for the little pup, with one user commenting: “Poor Millie is being ignored.” TeamDogs is a community for dog lovers who want to get the most out of their relationship with their best pal.

It also received countless comments, mostly from people urging Sam to quit - saying she should have practised more before committing to tattooing someone.What do you think about the tattoo  Let us know in the comments...In the video, Sam unveils the tattoo which is a minimalist outline of a womanaposs face with a rose over one eye, which was inked onto a red-haired womanaposs back. Captioning the video, Sam wrote: I have to say itaposs not bad for my first time tattooing on someone other than myself. I was nervous. But it appears that other TikTok users didnapost agree with her, as many were not impressed. One wrote: Did you do it blindfolded while jumping on a trampoline For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. And another said: Why do something so massive for your first time  You gotta start from somewhere, but bro, added a third user. You shouldaposve practised more. It is bad and thataposs just a fact. And another user had creative feedback, and wrote: Sausage fingers, wonky everything, bad line quality, lashes are - ooft. Please donapost tell me thataposs an infinity symbol, oh Lord. Sam then replied askingthe user had anything  to say, to which they wrote: Yeah, do not tattoo anyone until youaposre actually ready. In the clip, Sam reveals her artwork by wiping her clientaposs back with a paper towel - but that angered TikTok viewers too as people noticed she wasnapost wearing protective gloves. One user said: If you actually want a future in tattooing, take this down. No decent tattoo shop would hire someone blatantly ignoring biohazard safety like this. And another commented: No gloves  Did you close your eyes during the bloodborne pathogens training Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Known only as LJ, the woman said that often she will talk to other members of the cabin crew about passengers that she finds attractive, but she does it in secret.She said that the code she uses is universally understood, and others in the know will reply in kind to comment their opinion - and all the while the passengers are in the dark, as the Daily Star reports.LJ said she will refer to passengers as food, asking others aposwhat do you want to have for dinner tonightapos, and the other member of the cabin crew will say whether they would eat that food too. Speaking on the Confessions on the Fly podcast, flight attendant LJ said: I’ve picked up a dude on an aircraft, on my way to Austin four years ago. He was really cute. We had a couple of fun dates.My co-worker and I had this code ‘what do you want to have for dinner tonight ’ And you would say Italian or this or that. But we were really talking about the dudes coming on the aircraft. So we would have a code of like ‘no, I’m not really hungry for that’ or when somebody hot was coming on I’d be like, ‘oh yeah I’ll definitely go out for that tonight’. When somebody came on who was really really cute, I was like ‘oh yeah I definitely want whatever it was – Italian – for the night’. LJ then explained in further detail how she and her flight attendant friend Tony had employed their secret code to successfully get a passengers’ number. I bought him a drink on the aircraft and then when he came to the back of the aircraft to go to the restroom, my co-worker started talking to him, just warming him up or whatever, she continued. And then I jumped in and Tony casually walks to the front of the aircraft and gives us time to chat… and then I got his number. On the podcast episode, LJ also shared some tips for passengers who might want to make a move on cabin crew. Her main piece of advice, she noted, was that passengers should not try it on while attendants are doing service. That’s very awkward... If you want to grab our attention, being nice and courteous is rule number one, she added. Saying please and thank yous…you ask me how my day is or anything like that, I am so totally thrown off guard, because nobody talks to me other than to ask for a diet coke or whatever. So that, number one, perks me up and makes me actually look at you and pay attention.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Maxaposs favourite song is the iconic romantic tune ‘I Will Always Love You’, and even he simply can’t resist the urge to join in the famous long note that begins at the ballad’s chorus.The funny clip, which was posted by the TikTok user @nautiescape, begins with Max and his owner cruising on a boat together, as his human counterpart explains just how much his dog loves the song.He says that any time it comes on, Max can’t help but start howling and singing along. He then presses play and shows us just how talented his dog is.  As soon as the chorus of the track begins, Max instantly begins to howl along, really stretching his vocal chords as he threatens to give Whitney a run for her money. Viewers were clearly impressed by Max’s songbird abilities, with one commenting: “So much soul coming through that whooooo! Love it.” Another commenter wrote: “This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all day! Adorable!” A third added: “Whitney channelling through him… adorable.” Comment MORE ON Whitney HoustonLoveViralTeamDogsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old had already been gted an ornamental elephant and a bottle of gin from two of her daughters, Sophea and Kaytlyn. When she got to the third, from her -year-old daughter Jesyka, she tore off the paper to find a candle in her favourite scent, vanilla. It smelled amazing and seemed like the perfect present - until Hayleigh caught sight of what was written on the glass jar. Her daughter sheepishly apologised that the candle didnapost say aposmumapos on it, which is when the PA support worker took a closer look at the text. She read a heartfelt message designed for remembering aposa le so beautully lived, a heart so deeply lovedapos and realised the candle was intended as a memorial ornament, to mark a death - despite her being very much alive.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Stunned Hayleigh burst out laughing at the birthday blunder and joked sheaposd be sleeping aposwith one eye openapos in future. Despite the candle being for someone whoaposs dearly departed, Hayleigh said sheaposs not apostoo superstitiousapos to light it at some point - providing the words are facing away from her. The parent, from Great Bardfield, Essex, said: I guess Iaposll be sleeping with one eye open [from now on]. I think there was an ulterior motive - they were going to get me drunk, hit me over the head with the elephant, bury me and light the candle in memory. The candle is currently sitting on my bedroom side with the words facing the wall. Jesyka did say I could turn the bow round and not look at the words. I feel safe enough lighting it at some point, Iaposm not too superstitious.  The mum shared the hilarious mishap on social media where it quickly went viral, racking up more than , likes, shares and comments. Her post reads: Today is my birthday and my wonderful husband took our kids out to let them choose their own present which was super sweet. Three-year-old chose an elephant ornament as she said it matched my bedroom. Six-year-old chose gin coz in her words aposyouaposre always drinking ginapos. And -year-old bought me my favourite scent of candle which I thought smelt amazing until I read the words on the front. Guess Iaposll be sleeping with one eye open tonight and the husband learnt the valuable lesson of always checking the kidsapos choice of presents. What funny gts have you randomly received   Hayleigh continued to say that her -year-old electrical engineer hubby Ricky Austin, took the girls shopping for the gts Rickyaposs in charge of taking them out every year for my birthday presents and they each get to pick a present.Theyaposre normally quite good, he does have a little bit of influence sometimes for the younger ones because otherwise, I would end up with a Peppa Pig toy.Ricky had no idea until it came to wrapping it up the night before my birthday. Heaposs last-minute so by the time he did notice it, it was too late then. Jesyka was so determined to give me the candle because she knows that I love vanilla, so he wrapped it up. Weaposre quite a jokey, light-hearted family so he knew Iaposd see the funny side of it. I could smell it from the bag and I said aposah it smells amazingapos and she looked at me and said aposIaposm really sorry about the candleapos. I asked why she was sorry and she said aposbecause it doesnapost say mum on itapos. When I read it and saw it was an aposin loving memory candleapos I was in hysterics. My husband was laughing, Jesyka was laughing, it was very funny. After the present blunder, Hayleigh said Ricky had learned a valuable lesson and will check future purchases more closely. The mum added: The candle is currently sitting on my bedroom side with the words facing the wall. We had a good laugh about it.

You’ve got Harry Potter’s stag, Luna Lovegood’s hare, Albus Dumbledore’s phoenix and Ron Weasley’s...well...terrier. For those not in the know, a patronus is a defensive spell that produces a glowing silveranimal. Each wizard has their own unique creature although these can change in certain cases such as during bereavement or falling in love. For as long as Harry Potter has been in our lives, there has always been debate surrounding what Ron Weasley’s patronus actually is with the majority believing that it is a Jack Russell.A quick Google will even point you to a multitude of fan-run wiki pages and websites, many detailing this particular breed of dog as Ron’sso it’s no surprise that so many of us have simply accepted this to be the truth.But Ron’s actual patronus is, in fact, a Crup.  Ron is pure bloodand lives in a magical community so when you think about it, he wouldn’t have a domestic muggle animal as his patronus, he would have a magical one. So what is a Crup  In J.K Rowling’s world, a Crup is a wizarding breed of dog that looks deceptively similar to a Jack Russell, apart from one defining feature - a forked tail.According to the Fantastic Beasts website : “The Crup originated in the southeast of England. It closely resembles a Jack Russell terrier, except for the forked tail.“The Crup is almost certainly a wizard-created dog, as it is intensely loyal to wizards and ferocious towards Muggles. It is a great scavenger, eating anything from gnomes to old tyres. Crup licences may be obtained from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures on completion of a simple test to prove the applicant wizard is capable of controlling the Crup in Muggle-inhabited areas. “Crup owners are legally obliged to remove the Crup’s tail with a painless Severing Charm while the Crup is six to eight weeks old, lest Muggles notice it.” TeamDogs is a community for dog lovers who want to get the most out of their relationship with their best pal. Make sharing the cutest photos of your dog your first job on the website and after youaposve done that, leave a tip to help fellow dog owners live their best lives as a proud pooch parent. Search through hundreds of recommended walks, treats, toys and places to stay when youaposre on an adventure together. From dog-friendly pubs to product reviews and the latest news, you can snf it all out at TeamDogs. So, you can see where the confusion lies - for what is the dference between a Crup with a snipped tail and a run of the mill Jack Russell. To add to the uncertainty, in the film adaption of the Order of the Phoenix, Ron’s patronus is portrayed as a Jack Russell Terrier. In the books it is only mentioned as ‘a terrier’. While J.K Rowling herself described Ron’s patronus as being ‘like a Jack Russell’ - notice the ‘like’. This leaves us with one outstanding dilemma, just how would a wizard be able to tell the dference between a Crup and a Jack Russell  It turns out, without the forked tail there is no dference. When shown in Hagridaposs Care of Magical Creatures class, the narrator describes it as aposindistinguishable from a Jack Russell terrier except for its forked tailapos.

Appearing on Monday in front of a courtroom in the Swiss town of Lugano, in the Ticino region, Dirk W. told the court of how he was having sex with -year-old Anna Florence Reed on their bathroom floor when he put a hand towel around her neck. “Then I pressed on it with my hands, as we had done a hundred times before. Suddenly she stopped moving, her tongue was sticking out. I tried to resuscitate her,” he said. Ms Reed, from North Yorkshire, was found dead at Hotel La Palma au Lac, a four-star lakeside hotel in the southern Swiss municipality of Muralto on April  .The defendant, who has also been named as Marc Schatzle, or Marc S during some coverage of the case, maintains her death was the result of a sex game gone wrong.The prosecution believes he murdered the young woman to appropriate her fortune.  Her credit card, which was missing at the time of her death, was found in the ceiling of the hotel lt four months after the alleged crime. The defendant told the court he placed it there as a prank after his girlfriend complained about always paying for everything. The court heard how the pair had consumed alcohol and cocaine and had argued on the night before her death. During the court case, he was asked detailed questions by the judge, about their sex le on the date Ms Reed died and how did it come to pass that they played the strangulation game.  However, the defendant was unable to answer many of the questions because of the time distance involved, and also because he was very drunk on that date. His lack of recall over the events of the night, paired with his lestyle sleeping with hundreds of women over the years and living a VIP lestyle without worrying about his obligations to his two children, were key points considered in the case. However, the court also criticised the prosecutoraposs case in particular over failures of the investigators to ascertain the precise time of death of the young woman when called to the crime scene.

this day  years ago, marking one of the most important occasions in the history of the Granite City.Tens of thousands of people lined the streets leading to Foresterhill for miles, and all Aberdeen schoolchildren were given a half day to participate in the celebrations.Aberdonians jostled to get a view of the Duke of York#s cavalcade as it slowly made its way up Anderson Drive, and Grammar School boys clambered up their playing field railings to wave.The jovial ceremony was the culmination of years of fundraising in Aberdeen to pay for a new hospital, and the public happily waited for hours for the big unveiling.Join us on a step back in time as we look at a seminal moment in Aberdeen#s social history.Costing around £,, the new facilities were described by then Lord Provost Watt as #an epoch in the medical history of the city#.It was said rich and poor united in their efforts for the cause of the sick.The new infirmary was to replace the outdated one at Woolmanhill # at one time the outskirts of the city # but had been swallowed up during expansion.The rural lands of Foresterhill on the outskirts of the city were chosen for the state-of-the-art hospital complex and the foundation stone was laid in .ARI was the vision of doctor and champion of public health Professor Matthew Hay, who was known as the father of the Aberdeen Joint Hospitals Scheme.It was his ambition to have the city#s hospitals and medical teaching facilities together on one site.But it would be September  , after Prof Hay#s death, that the dream was realised, when the new buildings were unveiled by the Duke and Duchess of York Albert and Elizabeth # the future King and Queen.King Edward VIII, although staying at nearby Balmoral, was said to be too preoccupied with his orcee mistress Wallis Simpson to attend.The above photo shows the Duke in Highland dress accompanied by the Duchess arriving at the ceremony.The Duke said: #In carrying out this great project, Aberdeen is engaged in pioneer work.#Your city has been quick to realise the centering in one area of those facilities for the treatment of the sick by the most efficient methods of modern medicine.#When the maternity hospital is completed and the university buildings erected, Foresterhill will be indeed a Mecca of healing and medical learning.#I wish the doctors and nurses Godspeed in their great work of healing.#He ended his speech by unlocking the infirmary door with a large golden key.The crowd cheered as legions of nurses #made their way in detachments from the nurses# home down the hill# to their new workplace.Marching smartly to the infirmary and standing in rows of four, the Woolmanhill nurses had a place of honour at the ceremony.And the hospital chaplain said he hoped that they might #not only heal, but bless and shine as lamps of hope in the darkest hours of distress and fear#.The photo above shows the grand entrance hall that greeted the Royals who toured the new building and its mile-and-a-half of corridors, #expressing wonderment and admiration at everything they saw#.The #sunshine was streaming through the windows on the gleaming new equipment# as they were taken to the blue-tiled and air-conditioned operating theatres, the wards, kitchens and other departments.Innovative new apparatus included a new surgical screen designed by one of the hospital#s own medics Dr Knox.The new ones were made from steel and much more robust, and unlike ones on castors couldn#t be easily knocked over.But it was the X-Ray machine, above, that really captured the Duke#s imagination.Walking along the rubber carpet to the radium department the Royals #looked around in amazement at the gigantic X-Ray and therapy machines in the lead-lined room#.The Duke exclaimed that it #looked like a gun# as they were given a live demonstration.After the tour of the site, a tea party was organised in the nurses# home for the Royals and  guests.The Duke and Duchess were due to drive to the afterparty, but to the delight of onlookers, decided to walk down by the crowds of Aberdonians instead, below.The day was hailed as a triumph for Aberdeen and a triumph for modern medicine, and the innovation of the city#s forefathers has ensured the city has been at the forefront of pioneering medicine many times over the decades.For as little as £. a month you can access all

programme now under way, we#ve put together a collection of Covid vaccine tracker charts to monitor the progress of the Covid- vaccine rollout across the UK.How many people have been vaccinated How many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine What is the uptake like during pregnancy The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range as well as the percentage of that population covered.There is limited data available on vaccinations in pregnancy, however we do have monthly data on the number of people vaccinated by pregnancy trimester.Coronavirus in Scotland # track the spread with these charts\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland # track the spread with these charts# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials coronavirus-in-scotland-track-the-spread-in-these-charts-and-maps embed # secretanuYMBbtv\" data-secret\"anuYMBbtv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Coronavirus in Scotland – here are the key demographics\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland – here are the key demographics# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials coronavirus-in-scotland-here-are-the-key-demographics embed # secretbLHWrhpUp\" data-secret\"bLHWrhpUp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Let us knowthere is something  you think we should be tracking by emailing lkelly@dctmediaFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor august 27 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Sir,Last Sunday I was burning some garden waste in a garden incinerator when the fire brigade arrived at my home in Lochgilphead.I have done this almost weekly for many years and it has never caused any problems. The incinerator is metal, sitting on a stone base with a lid and I am always in attendance. There#s even a hose nearby.Anyone could see what it was.If the person who called the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service did so by mistake, that#s fine.Butit was a joke, it failed miserably. Andit was done with malicious intent as a hoax call, that#s another thing entirely.What would have happenedour firefighters were needed for an actual emergency while attending my bonfire of weeds Name and address suppliedSir,Scotland must seize the opportunity to rapidly increase planting of productive forestry to offset the full impact of future timber supply stocks.The UK as a whole # which currently imports  per cent of its annual timber requirement # is far too vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market.Home-grown timber makes up only around  per cent of the UK market and while we are largely self-sufficient in fencing, there is signicant unmet domestic demand for more structural timber and also pallet wood.Scottish-based timber manufacturers could potentially triple production to meet current and anticipated future demand and produce a greater share of the remaining  per cent of the market which is currently imported, predominantly from Scandinavia, Latvia and Germany.There is also signicant potential to expand Scotland’s one fth of forested land area so that we can be more self-reliant in our requirements for timber.Sawmills in Scotland and UK produce high quantities of pallet and fencing products but mainly produce construction timber # kiln dried carcassing that is used for roof battens, floor joists and studwork for partitioned walls.Already this year prices have risen  per cent as house builders and related industries struggle to secure supplies due to a huge increase in building activity, post lockdown.This is even noticeable in the DIY stores when trying to get timber for home projects.Transport and energy costs will increase emerging economies around the world will demand more timber and timber-producing countries may be required to use more of their own timber at home as they seek to meet stricter climate protocols and net zero targets.Sweden is recording the lowest stock levels in  years and this trend is likely to be further exacerbated as current issues like wildfires, tree diseases and pests, exert additional worldwide pressures on the supply of timber.The UK can attempt to compete for diminishing supplies on the world market against growing economies such as China and India or do something to mitigate its exposure to these forces, by planting more commercial forestry now so that we are more self-sufficient in the future.Mick Bottomley, head of marketing and sales, Forestry and Land ScotlandSir,Anyone turning  years old in the near future shouldn#t hold their breath for much of a state pension increase.As I approach my big birthday, I have been informed I will receive just p more per week. That won#t buy me a couple of slices of bread or a pint of milk. I couldn#t even buy half a second class stamp with it.I have worked all my le, including more than  years for the NHS, until  years ago and this is my reward.I#ve never felt more insulted it#s worse than a slap in the face.Quite frankly, it#s a disgrace.Rachel S Grant, CarradaleSir,As part of their newly announced agreement with the SNP government, the Scottish Greens have sold out the Highlands and Islands in their quest for power.Within the new agreement, announced last week, the Scottish Greens have managed to retain their ability to disagree with their SNP colleagues on certain issues, however have specically said that with regard to Highlands and Islands aviation and HIAL they will follow the SNP’s lead.Given the ongoing issues with Air Traffic Control management proposals in the Highlands and Islands this exemption would appear to be aimed at ensuring the Scottish Government can force through controversial changes that would see jobs centralised in Inverness and a signicant loss of local knowledge.The fact that this issue is specied in the document not only indicates that the SNP is very aware of the anger, resentment and damage that HIAL’s proposals are causing to the affected communities, but that they don’t care and have every intention of forcing through the proposals no matter what engagement they get from stakeholders.By allowing this as an exemption, the Scottish Greens have indicated that they too are now aware but aren’t particularly concerned with issues affecting the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, but are willing to sell out a huge swathe of the countryit means they can get the SNP’s scraps.Of further concern is what this indicates about the Scottish Government’s level of respect for parliamentary process.A petition from local communities asking the Air Traffic Management Scheme to be halted while independent assessments are undertaken is currently before the petitions committee.By including the Highlands and Islands as an exemption whereby the Greens must fall in line, Scottish Government are indicating that they know a contentious decision is on the horizon and want to be able to shepherd it through despite any and all logical and well-informed protests.It is clear that the Scottish Greens have no intention of properly vetting policies in relation to the Highlands and Islands and are happy to allow the SNP to run roughshod over the communities there.Rhoda Grant, Labour MSP for the Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 3 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.The response from the Scottish Ambulance to Councillor Philand#s earlier approach has encouraging aspects, and others which leave room for concern.The recruitment of more ambulance personnel is good news, and let#s hope they are trained and on the front line before too long.

Many of these are linked to previous and devastating trauma and are only made worse by the circumstances they are forced to live in.Part of our work at Crisis is to ensure our clients have the psychological support they need to establish a le away from homelessness. Keeping this going through the pandemic has been a real challenge and Crisis staff have been finding all sorts of creative solutions.In the early days of the pandemic our coaches worked rapidly to provide phones, tablets, laptops and data to our clients who needed it and adapted our services, including our psychological support, so we could provide a continued leline over the phone and online.With lockdown and restrictions now eased, it is a relief for our clients to feel less of the added mental pressure that we#ve had from the circumstances of the last year and for face-to-face support to be more of an option again.Whether in person or online, all our work is only made possible by the fantastic people and organisations who support us, meaning we can continue to help people across the country to leave homelessness behind for good.On behalf of Crisis and the thousands of people we support each year, we would particularly like to thank the players of People’s Postcode Lottery, across Scotland and where, who have helped fund the vital work of our clinical psychologists in such dficult times.Peter Oakes, lead clinical psychologist at CrisisSir,Recent disruptions with our ferry service from Islay to the mainland have once again shown us just how much we depend on a fit-for-purpose service with reliable, newer vessels in operation.Unfortunately this is currently not the case as our ferry fleet has been underfunded for many years,not decades, as a result of decisions made by urban-centric central government.Our frontline CalMac ferry crews and port staff are hard-working and an asset to our island and mainland communities, however they can only work with the tools they have at hand.The -year-old MV Hebridean Isles is one of the oldest in the state-owned fleet and while it was no doubt good in its day that day has passed a long time ago. Problems with our Islay ferry service have also been exacerbated with the continued poaching of one of our ferries in the summer months for other areas that CalMac operates in.On numerous occasions, distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.The feeling amongst many of my constituents is that it is we on Islay, Jura and Colonsay who always end up getting a raw deal.This simply cannot be allowed to continue.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,Thanks to funding from the Scottish Power Foundation, an Argyll and Bute scheme is offering young people a new route to gaining employment and skills in heritage.Heritage Horizons, run by the Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles , and Argyll and Bute Heritage and Museums Forum, aims to address the issue of an ageing workforce in the heritage and museums sectors by offering skill-building opportunities for young people.The project will work with Argyll heritage venues in areas of high unemployment, developing  accredited placements for young people.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

We donrsquot see that in any other ankylosaur and in fact we donrsquot see that in any other vertebra that we know of, living or dead, she said.The specimen is so unusual that at first the researchers wonderedit could be a fake.Dr Maidment acquired the rib from a fossil dealer in Cambridge in , and has named the species Spicomellus afer: Spicomellusmeaning collar of spikes, and afer meaning lsquoof Africarsquo.She had earlier led the study on a new species of stegosaurian dinosaur ndash the oldest definite stegosaur ever found ndash which had been found at the same site.ldquoWe thought itwas a stegosaur because it was from a site in Morocco where we named a stegosaur last year and we saw that this fossil comprised a series of spines, and stegosaurs do have some spines on their body, she said.vw,vw,px, px\"A specimen of the oldest ankylosaur ever discovered Further inspection of the fossil showed a particular texture of the bone, which forms a cross-hatch type pattern, that is unique to ankylosaurs.Dr Maidment, honorary senior lecturer at the University of Birmingham,hopes to visit the site in the future and learn more about why there has only been one ankylosaur fossil found in Africa so far.She added: ldquoPrior to this find wersquove had no ankylosaur fossils from Africa at all from any time period in the Mesozoic and we donrsquot know why that is.ldquoIt could be because they werenrsquot a very common part of ecosystems in Africa or it could be that we just havenrsquot found their fossils yet.ldquoThis is a new site where these dinosaurs are coming from so perhapswe keep looking there wersquoll be able to find more of this skeleton because it is rather fragmented at the moment.The findings are published in Nature Ecology and Evolution..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Spiky fossil of new species of ankylosaur found in Morocco"},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-get-free-cheeseburger-mayo-chicken-mcflurry-delivery","story":"As September draws to a close, universities and colleges are back in full swing as studentsto campus.It means that there are lots of free deals around to save you some money, with McDonalds the latest chain to get in on the action.A valid student card has been enough to get you a free item in restaurant for a while, but now this deal has been extended to deliveries.Heres how to claim your free McDonalds Cheeseburger, Mayo Chicken or McFlurry...How to claim a free Chicken Mayo, Cheeseburger or McFlurry from McDonaldsThere are three ways to claim your free McDonalds item alongside your meal when ordering after am..

One must also consider the neighbouring island of Jura, which has its own whisky and gin distilleries whose only vehicle link is from Islay. It has separately been suggested that Islay has the largest per capita carbon footprint in ScotlandDuring this period of disruption ndash which commenced on September  ndash there has been a single additional sailing by the MV Isle of Mull , and all sailings ndash bar one ndash to Port Askaig, so rendering the south of the island effectively more than one hour further off-shore.During this time an announcement has been made by CMAL regarding which companies have passed the first assessment to build new ferries for Islay ndash but a great deal of emphasis has been on this not including Fergusons rather than the acute need for enhanced services. But nor has there been mention of how the local infrastructure also needs upgrading and investment.The MV Clansman may be  years old but is too large to fit either of the ports on Islay or the mainland pier at Kennacraig despite major works having been done at all three sites since the millennium ndash but it is able to use the pier at Colonsay, which has a population of around .Inter-changeability of vessels and co-ordination of services was a principle behind the successful tender by Calmac for Clyde and Hebrides ferry services but often there seems to be little evidence of joined-up thinking ndash and this also applies to CMAL.The two-organisations approach emulates the discredited and abandoned \"purchaser-provider split\" the NHS was formerly subject to, and whilst management of both should be scrutinised, the whole issue of management structure merits urgent parliamentary review.Jean Knowles, Laphroaig, Islay.UNDERSTANDING BREAST SCREENINGHAPPILY, Alasdair Stevenrsquos obituary of Pat Forrest, emeritus professor of surgery at the University of Edinburgh, recorded a long, well-lived, illustrious le and service .Pat was my fatherrsquos generation and I first encountered him as lecturer and rather forbidding questioner of fourth-year medical students round a patientrsquos bed in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in . My next substantive encounter was some  years later as a junior member of akirk session of which he was a senior. He was wise, friendly and delightful ndash but pithy with it.One signicant contribution among many was as mentioned, to chair the group which recommended beginning a UK-wide breast screening programme.As a scientist and clinician he would have understood the more recent evidence which has put in doubt the benefits versus risks of that programme. As such, it is really important women know both the potential advantages and disadvantages of breast screening before deciding whether to attend their appointment or not.Obviously itrsquos a major worry for many women and just getting the invitation letter can be stressful. Most women just want to know what they should do. But it is important that women understand both the pros and cons involved in breast screening and how it might impact on them. The literature sent out by post reflects this tension in words and illustration which should assist inidual decisions.Dr Philip Gaskell, Drymen.DEBUNKING THE ACCENTS MYTHANYONE who seriously believes that we, or any of the schools we represent, either support or display \"accentism\"needs to spend five minutes in our office or one of our schools.Debunking myths from the far side of world is not the same thing as promoting them, and cheap shots are cheap whoever they are levelled at.

My work is hugely erse in nature, and I work collaboratively across the University, but also across the city and region to identy, influence and deploy climate solutions and make change happen.I am already an experienced sustainability practitioner with more than  yearsrsquo experience in the implementation of sustainability solutions and climate action however,I was immediately attracted to the Royal Scottish Geographical SocietyrsquosClimate Solutions Professional course because it offers refreshing and informative course content.It has enabled me to update my understanding of current climate science and policy and engage with a group of peers across a range of sectors and to share insights on the need and urgency of climate action.Most importantly, the course has enabled me to reinforce my own climate work on behalf of the University, to think about how I should be approaching the climate issue in the work that I do and to think about how best to communicate climate and sustainability effectively.I particularly valued the workshops where I could share ideas with colleagues and peers working in the same area and obtaining feedback. After the course content and the workshops, I have undertaken several elements of work to translate what I have learnt into meaningful action.I have taken that immediate knowledge from the course and used it to very and secure constructive feedback on my vision and plan to create a series of lsquoClimate Neutral Districtsrsquo across all operational University assets.The Climate Neutral Districts vision adopts a whole systems approach that seeks to deliver % renewable heat, power, transport, adaptation and well-being solutions that are also socially inclusive. The work seeks to identy and understand the best engineering and socially inclusive climate solutions available to the University.The potential of these solutions has been framed within criteria of scale of investment emissions reduction potential community inclusion commercial viability and deliverability.This vision and plan will enable the University to proactively respond to the need for climate action in a manner that not only delivers emissions reductions, but also seeks to enable climate resilience where possible and in a manner that is collaborative, innovative, bold, and ambitious, and importantly, people oriented.It also seeks to signpost net zero investments that stimulate a green recovery. In addition, I have encouraged academic and professional colleagues to take part in the training in order to build capacity across the University in this area.Several senior colleagues are now taking part in the course.Thirdly, in a much wider application, I have used the findings from the course to work with colleagues at the University and to commence the roll out of Carbon Literacy training for all staff and students.It is important that we are all able to understand how to address and engage with the changing climate and to think about how we can take action.As a result, the whole University community is now offered climate training at several levels and this is so important given the nature of the climate emergency.The Climate Solutions Professional course has given me new insight into practical application and capacity building.I would thoroughly recommend the course to people seeking to influence change in private and public organisations and groups.www.climatesolutionsnetwork---------------------------------------Get an onlineintroductionto solutions in sustainabilityTHE Herald is determined to play its full part in the climate change debate, having recently launched a pioneering new initiative in conjunction with Climate Solutions Network.This unique online programme has been developed by the Royal Scottish Geographical Societyin association with the Universities of Stirling and Edinburgh and the Institute of Directors .Climate Solutions Accelerator provides a quick, simple and rounded introduction to the fundamentals of climate change, helping to explain how everyone and every organisation can play a vital role to reduce their emissions, and informing businesses and organisations so they can better plan and predict future trends, legislation, and change.It focuses on the need-to-know information and most importantly outlines the key solutions managers can implement to respond to climate change and is already being used by other forward-thinking major organisations.www.climatesolutionsnetwork"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-records-highest-number-centenarians","story":"Data released by National Records of Scotlandon Thursday shows  centenarians currently live in Scotland.The figure is a % rise from last year, and part of a consistent rise as elderly people in Scotland are living longer.Women make up four times more of those over  than men, with  females and just  males.Esther Roughsedge, the head of population and migration at NRS said: ldquoThe number of people in the oldest age groups has been steadily increasing.ldquoThe latest figures show that as at June  there were  people aged  and over in Scotland.ldquoThis is the highest ever figure, and is  higher than the previous yearrsquos figure.ldquoThe rise is linked to the increase in the number of births that followed the end of the First World War."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September ,  at : pmOne of the last surviving veterans to serve in Scapa Flow during the Second World War made avisit, this week,  years on from when he first landed in Orkney.

It also provides guidance for mums and dads on testing, self-isolation, and vaccination.Read the letter in full, below. Dear parents and carers,With schools having been back for nearly four weeks, I want to commend the care, commitment and courage shown by everyone in playing their part in keeping our communities safe. The number of cases of COVID- across Orkney have been rising of late and have affected a small proportion of adults and young people who attend at some of our schools.On Monday this week, there were  positive cases linked to Stromness Academy and we now also see six positive cases at Kirkwall Grammar School.We have worked closely with Public Health colleagues in Orkney and, together, we have managed local clusters very effectively. This was only successful thanks to the diligence of parents, pupils and staff in following the mitigations in place and for managing these situations positively but cautiously.Whilst so much has changed over the past  months, the fundamentals within our schools have remained the same. Children and young people still come to school to learn, play and socialise with their friends.The easing of restrictions has left some relieved and others anxious. I want to reassure you all that staff are doing everything they can to make your child’s experience a positive one, in particular by implementing Scottish Government guidance to keep us all as safe as possible.I do understand that there will be a level of nervousness among some of you with regard to the recent transmission rates, on this basis, the Education team felt it may be helpful to share the following information with you: Mitigating measures include:• Distancing between adults and between pupils when required.A detailed list of the mitigations is published below.There has also been some confusion around testing and the dference between PCR and LFD tests. Only request a PCR test :• You are contacted by Test  ProtectLateral Flow Device Tests:• Please ensure that you log the results of your Lateral Flow Devicetest onlineyou test positive or negative, this helps give an indication of whether or not the virus is spreading. Parents who are concerned their children might have contracted Covid can complete a self-help guide on NHS Inform that will help them determinethis is the case.If you develop symptoms or you have a positive LFD test, then you must request a PCR test through the COVID Assessment Centre . To request a vaccination call:   . The COVID Assessment Centre opens at .am and closes at pm . After a positive LFD you must isolate until your PCR test confirms you are negative. If your PCR is positive there will be isolation protocols that you will have to follow the NHS Orkney team will help folk every step of the way.Unless exempt, current mitigations are:•Hygiene, Ventilation and Face Coverings • All hand and respiratory hygiene mitigations will continue to be encouraged, and an enhanced cleaning regime will continue to apply in buildings and vehicles.• Windows should continue to be opened regularly to maximise ventilation.• Face coverings will continue to be a requirement at all times for all staff and learners in secondary schools.• In primary school, all other establishments, adults will be expected to wear a face covering whenever they cannot maintain physical distance from other adults, children or young people.• In nurseries, adults will be expected to wear a face covering whenever they cannot maintain physical distance from other adults, including parents.• In primary schools, adults will also need to wear a face covering whenever they are moving around communal areas of the school, including corridors.• Only pupils aged  and over will be required to wear a face covering when travelling on dedicated school transport. Groupings and Distancing• The grouping of pupils and adults into discrete bubbles will no longer be required, but assemblies and other large gatherings will continue to be kept on hold for the time being.• There will be no requirement for children and young people to maintain physical distancing between each other, although this will continue to be encouraged in secondary schools.• The distance that adults are required to maintain from other adults, children and young people has formally been reduced to one metre, however schools will continue to encourage pupils and staff to maintain two metre distancing wherever possible. Nursery children are not required to keep a distance from adults or children in the setting.• Pupils using dedicated school transport will not be expected to maintain distancing between each other, but there will remain an expectation that drivers remain at least one metre distance from all passengers.• Parents and carers will continue to be discouraged from attending school premises except in cases where this is agreed with the school as being absolutely necessary. Vaccination, Testing and Self-Isolation• Adults and secondary pupils will be encouraged to take twice-weekly LFD tests and to record their results online.• Any adult, child or young person who develops the symptoms of COVID-, or who test positive must self-isolate immediately in line with NHS Guidance, and noty their school.• Anyone who is fully vaccinated identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant.• Any young person aged between  years and  years four months, who is not yet fully vaccinated and who is identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant.• Any adult aged over  years four months, who is not fully vaccinated and who is identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and seek a PCR test.  They should continue to self-isolate for ten days from onset of symptoms eventhe test result is negative. • Children and young people aged from five to  will no longer be subject to a blanket requirement to self-isolate for ten daysthey are identied as a close contact by Test and Protect. Instead, they should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant. Children aged under  will be exempt from this testing.• Schools and Early Learning Childcare settings will not be required to stand down classes in the event of a positive case being identied.  They will, instead, send parents and staff a #warn and inform# letter advising them of the facts and reminding them that there is no need to self-isolate unless contacted by Test and Protect and advised otherwise.• The Chief Medical Officer advises that children and young people on the highest risk list can now follow that same advice as the rest of the population.

Initially, they said to us, just come through whenever you can.#The training is run by a PE teacher from Invergordon, and on the same night you have under-s, under-s, and under-s.“They train in Invergordon as they were previously Invergordon girls — but they came under the umbrella of Ross County around Christmas time.”Earlier this month Beth was part of the Ross County under- girls team that competed in an international youth football tournament for the Edinburgh Cup.Ross County finished top of their group with wins over more seasoned clubs # East Fe, Spartans and Hibernian.They then played Northern Irish side Linfield in the quarter-finals which ended in a - draw in normal time but County prevailed - on penalties — with Beth converting one of the spot-kicks which earned their victory.The Staggies’ adventure came to an end in the last four against a strong Irish select, but the team surpassed expectations with their performances.As well as travelling through to Invergordon to play, Beth has also been involved with the local set-up with Portree’s under-s.Youth coach Phil McCaherty said: “We#ve had Beth in our under-s set-up for a good few years now.#She is a very talented player with a high skill level and she guarantees  per cent in all that we ask her to do on a football pitch.#We are delighted to see Beth progress with Ross County and wish her well.#At present Beth is playing for County in the North Under- Rachel McLachlan League which also features Strathspey, Thistle Girls, and Brora Rangers.County#s most recent fixture against Strathspey was postponed due to Covid concerns, but the team have already made a strong start to the campaign having recorded a - victory against Brora in their opening game.Beth scored five goals in that win including an excellent strike from a free-kick.Commenting on her time so far with the club, she told the Free Press: #They are really nice, and have been very welcoming.Touching on her style as a player she said: #Whenever I have a chance for a shot on goal I#ll take it, unless someone has a better chance then I#ll pass it to them.#I like watching Erin Cuthbert at Cha, but I would like to play for Rangers and Scotland one day.#Shona added: #I don#t care which team she plays for, as long as she#s happy wherever she goes.#It is about taking part, the girls are really good fun and she#s really enjoying it.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HOUSING-LACHIE-MACDONALD-1.jpg","title":"from four homes to 800 lochalsh and skye housing chief calls time after 35","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineMr MacDonald officially retired on st September having overseen the growth of the organisation from a minute quota of just four houses in Glendale to a portfolio approaching  affordable rental properties across the Lochalsh and Skye area. this week, Lachie spoke passionately about the development of the association, praised his colleagues and the board for their innovative approach, and expressed his desire to spend a lot more time with his family following his departure from the CEO position..#You know within yourself when it is time to move on and hand over the reins to fresh blood — because we always need new ideas and experiences from people to move the organisation forward.#The Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association was established on st March . On st April , Lachie was appointed as the first member of staff and director and went on to become the chief executive officer.: #At that time, the association had built four houses for affordable rent in Glendale. It now has a housing portfolio of  affordable rent and  shared equity properties.#In addition to the affordable housing stock, Lachie has expanded the association’s range of services beyond our tenants to the wider community by taking over the responsibility of the care and repair service from Shelter and establishing the handyperson service — the first in Scotland # to assist our elderly folk in Lochalsh and Skye remain at home for as long as is reasonably possible.#He also established our innovative energy advice service for the wider community to reduce household fuel costs.#He added: ”Through Lachie’s leadership, the association has grown from one to  members of staff who all have the highest regard and respect for this man.“I have never heard a bad word said about Lachie, either from the staff, the board or within the community in which he serves.#While unaware of Mr McIvor#s praise, Lachie was quick to commend his colleagues for their important contributions to those achievements.#We have a fantastic staff team # we really are blessed. None of this is down to me, it is down to working as a team.“In that I include the board which over the years has been absolutely fantastic in supporting ideas.#If the board didn#t think that taking on a handy person project or setting up care and repair, or energy advice service was good, these things wouldn#t have happened — they have been very open about the role that the association could play as a community anchor.”He added: #Some of the things that we do I think are fantastic and have been copied where in Scotland # because the notion that we would have handyperson employees installing telecom devices in people#s homes throughout the whole of the Highlands just wouldn#t have been thought of.#I have been really lucky with the quality and flexibility of the people I have worked with # both the board and the staff members.#Commenting on his successor, he went on to say: #Neil Clapperton was until recently the chief executive of Grampian Housing Association through in Aberdeen # so it is a relief to be able to hand over to an experienced person rather than someone from another discipline to be trained up by the existing staff and board.#I think with the senior management now led by Neil and with keeping the same people such as Iain McIvor as director of investment, and our new director of finance services, Graeme Coull, and of course Angus MacLennan as our technical manager — that#s a really powerful team to take the organisation forward.#I#ll miss the people, they are absolutely splendid.#Reflecting on his time, Lachie said: #The housing system in the Highlands and Islands has never been in a better position.“My ambition was to wipe out homelessness in Skye and Lochalsh before I retired, and while I have not quite achieved that we have made huge strides towards dealing with that dficult issue.#I am quite optimistic that I am leaving the sector in a good position and ready to meet the challenges that they have ahead.#Looking ahead to retired le, Lachie said:#My three children and my grandchildren are all resident in and around Glasgow, they are all busy people but I want to spend signicantly more time with them, and also my family from Uist # I have sisters and lots of relatives over there so I#ll have a lot more time to visit them.“And I want to carry on my work as a board member with Am Fasgadh .#The only bit of advice I#ve had about retirement that someone said to me was #When you retire do nothing, and then do something’. I will take a rest and recharge my batteries but then I will have a look at what the future holds.”Mr McIvor added: #On a personal note, I am proud to have known Lachie for over  years as my director and then chief executive officer.#He is also a true friend, as are his family, and through his guidance, support and good humour, I am a better person for knowing Lachie MacDonald.#I have no doubt in my mind that this could be said by anyone who has met this remarkable and modest man.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flora-Mac-Innes-with-husband-Norman-and-other-family-members.jpg","title":"hebridean history families reunited by the sound of a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIn one astonishing example, that happened just after the launch of Tobar an Dualchais, a man whose father had died in the Second World War before he was born was able to hear his father’s voice for the first time.For most of us, we can only imagine what that must have been like: strangely recognisable phrases and subtle mannerisms or turns of phrase, along with deeper thoughts of how things might have been dferent…Whatever the case, we can be sure that for those who are able to reconnect or gain greater insight through the recordings of friends and family members long after they have passed is truly extraordinary and deeply personal.My mother, IsabelMacKenzie, had one of these experiences when she attended an event hosted by TAD in Lochboisdale in ..She of course immediately recognised her voice, although it had been some  years since her mother’s death.I never got to meet my grandmother. She died on Good Friday in  in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Daliburgh, South Uist. I was born six months later in the same hospital.I’ve always felt a special connection to her because I was named after her, although this almost didn’t happen.My motherthought she would name me ‘Fiona’. However, when our doctor, the highly regarded Dr Alasdair MacLean , asked what I was to be called and was told, he replied abruptly and conclusively declared that I was instead to be named after my grandmother. And that was that!It is a joy for me to be able to listen to my grandmother’s recordings. Her singing voice is quite similar to my mother’s, and through listening, I get a sense of the person she was..!Flòraidh was certainly hardy, like many women in those days.She gave birth to  children and my mother was the youngest of the ten that survived. She described her eleventh child as “gille mòr snog” . He was stillborn, and very little mention was made of him after his birth. until he was carried out by my grandfather who, with the other children in the family, took him to the cemetery in Baile, Eriskay.Already grateful for the opportunity to hear these recordings of my grandmother, I was truly amazed when I found recordings of her mother – my great grandmother, Mary Johnston.Although attempts had been made by family members over the years to locate these recordings of her, no one had succeeded until I happened upon them quite by accident.She was recorded in , shortly before she died, by Father Angus John MacQueen who was collaborating with John Lorne Campbell at the time and helping to build what now constitutes the ‘Canna Collection’.Mary Johnstonor ‘a Nì’ as she was known to her family, was born in Barra in  and was the daughter of Michael MacNeil of Castlebay and Anne Steele of Boisdale, South Uist.At the age of around four her mother passed away and she was taken to Uist to live with her auntie, whilst her father worked at sea..She tells how after her grandfather’s death her father was given an ultimatum:home to the family croft on Bernerayor it would be handed over to someone .Michael ed, promptly re-married, and Nì was sent back to live with him and her new stepmother..What isn’t mentioned in the recordings is that she was sent to the recently founded Orphanage for Roman Catholic Children in Bute where she trained as a cook.On herto Barra she met Ronald Johnston from Eriskay who was working in a shop in Castlebay and soon after they eloped to Glasgow. The fact that they were of a similar age to one another was considered undesirable at the time more conventionally, women tended to marry men a fair bit older than them.They had eight children together four girls and four boys – two of whom were killed in the Great War.The German aristocrat and photographer Werner Kissling took two marvellous photos of Nì during his famous filming trip to Eriskay in . The photos somehow manage to at once capture conflicting expressions of happiness, sadness, restlessness and contentment. A neat and handsome lady, she nevertheless seems considerably older than the  years she had already lived when Kissling visited.She is remembered as a kind woman who spoke often of le in Barra and the Barra Head islands, though she never set foot on any of them again after her marriage.It means a lot to me that I can listen to recordings of these two women on Tobar an Dualchais. Hearing their voices and listening to them sing songs and give descriptions of the places they lived gives me a stronger sense of who I am.are women, women’s voices are so proportionately under-represented. No one is to blame for this it is just a reflection of the time in history when so much of this material was collected.Looking at the present and to the future, I can see that there is a precious opportunity to speak with my own mother about her le, about themes more related to women, and to motherhood in particular.She herself gave birth to seven children in the s whilst working part-time as a physiotherapist. She was straddling a very traditional world while also trying meet the growing, and often conflicting, expectations of a modern professional woman.She, like so many other women of her generation, has an important story to tell and important insights to give."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-20210918-WA0002-1.jpg","title":"glory game kinlochshiel lift shintys camanachd cup for the first","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineKeith MacRae struck a hat-trick to seal a deserved victory in front of a bumper crowd # the bulk of whom had made the journey from the west.It might have been Shiel#s first Camanachd final in  years, but their players rose to the challenge in all areas of the pitch to edge out a Lovat team who were making their fourth appearance in the sport#s showcase in six years.After a cagey opening the west-coasters seized the initiative in the th minute # MacRae lashing home on the backhand from  yards after his brother John had pounced on a shanked hit-in from Lovat#s Drew Howie.Shiel grew in confidence after the opener and it took a magnicent ing save from goalkeeper Stuart Macdonald to deny John MacRae a second before Lovat rallied towards the end of the half.And with the interval fast approaching Greg Matheson found space on the left to send a rasping finish high beyond Josh Grant, the Shiel keeper, to square the match.The Kiltarlity side pressed hard in the early stages of the second period, but Shiel#s defence stood firm.And on the hour mark they broke swtly to restore the advantage. MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter. And deep into injury-time MacRae completed the fairy tale with another adroit finish for the hat-trick.There were no shortage of contenders for the Albert Smith medal for man of the match # but the award, now in its th year, went to defensive lynchpin Conor Cormack.After the match the -year-old hat-trick-hero, who previously feared he might have to quit the game after a succession of knee injuries, said: #It#s not really sunk it yet # at the final whistle we had people running to us and crying. It will take a while and maybe it will be a few days before it all hits home.#It#s something we all hoped hadn#t passed us by # you need a good run of games, and fortunately it has worked out for us this year. It#s an amazing feeling.#Kinlochshiel manager Johnston Gill, who has now led the club to the Premier League, MacAulay Cup and Camanachd Cup, added: #Lovat gave us a hard time of it, but we had Keith MacRae on fire today # the whole team were brilliant. #It was nip and tuck after they came back to - but I think we shaded the game as a whole.#We knew the threat they carried, but Fraser Heath was well marked by Finlay MacRae and Conor did a great job against Greg Matheson. #We got our tactics right and used our subs well # they were all outstanding.#It#s a fantastic day # most of the community is here with us in Oban # they are great for us, and give us fantastic backing. We will all enjoy it!#Meanwhile, earlier in the day Skye Camanachd also had a victory to savour as their under- team lted the Ken MacMaster Cup.Goals from Seonaidh MacLeod and Alasdair Stewart sealed a - win over Fort William."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4097188.jpg--.jpg?1632220580000\n","title":"ni businesses showcase their produce and services at london exhibition","story":"DOZENS of Northern Ireland businesses have showcased their products and services at an exhibition in London.The Westminster event is part of the Northern Ireland Offices centenary programme.Business leaders also attended a reception at Downing Street last Wednesday hosted by the prime minister.The government said it would provide businesses with an opportunity to network with international companies and investors.The exhibitors represented a cross-section of sectors within the Northern Ireland economy and included  start-ups.

Led by musical Director, Maebh McKeon, the week-long course offered an eclectic mix of creative, cultural and educational activities. As well as fiddle lessons, brains were put to the test with a music theory course, toes were pointed for ceilidh dancing lessons, and an African drum workshop created some wonderful vibes. A small socially distanced concert celebrated the end of the week and marked the beginning of business as usual with the Fiddle School reopening at the weekend.Maebh, a musician and teacher for over  years, is delighted to be back. “I’ve been running CADCFA for many years now and Covid, more than anything, shows how important music groups are to the community,” outlined Maebh.“Young people have been isolated for so long. CADCFA is as much about preserving the social aspect of traditional music, as it is about the music itself. It’s about social connections, making music together at community events, and of course, having some good old-fashioned fun.”CADCFA is a cross community charity which serves the local community through concerts, and affordable group lessons by experienced teachers.

That’s the simplest way of looking at the proposals for a single transfer test across all grammars. The plan would see the end of the dual running of tests by the AQE and the PPTC.In some respects, it’s a breaching of the religious ide, with the PPTC used mainly by Catholic grammars and the AQE by others. But it can also be looked at as a circling of the wagons to protect the future of academic selection — one of the most hotly contested debates in Northern Ireland education over the past  years.

Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      The plan would see a new company, the Schools’ Entrance Assessment Group, established to run the transfer test, carrying on a tradition for the selection of pupils to post-primary schools that was started in .The proposals have been drawn up by a group of  current and former grammar principals, referred to as “the implementation and the negotiating teams.”In a week’s time, we’ll know whether all grammar schools have bought in to the concept, though the early indications are that the majority are in favour of taking matters into their own hands.The removal of the -plus in  by the Education Minister muddied the waters. It was expected to herald a new dawn in education, but instead grammar schools remained defiant and went their own separate ways, mainly along religious lines.Where there was a single test, two replaced it. And for the full range of choice, pupils were left to sit up to five test papers.The conversation happening now between grammar schools should probably have been had more than a decade ago.In April this year, the DUP — strong defenders of the right to academic selection and parental choice — accused Sinn Fein and the SDLP of trying to destroy grammar schools following a heated Assembly debate on the transfer test.While the Sinn Fein motion — featuring an SDLP amendment calling on the Education Minister to end the transfer test system — was passed  votes to , that didn’t really change things. What it did do, however, was earmark a direction of future travelthe political landscape changes in Stormont.If opinion polls are correct about the future make-up of the Assembly, change might not be too far down the road.What the proposal won’t do is change the opinion of many who believe academic selection is wrong, labels a child with failure at an early age and is a barrier to those who are socially disadvantaged.What it will do is cement the belief of grammar schools that academic selection is the best format for selection, whether that plays into the hands of anti-elitism campaigners or not.United, grammar schools will be in a much stronger position to protect what they believe in.It’s a bold move. To be successful, it will need a complete buy-in from all grammars, lest the dual transfer test system that has been struggling along these past dozen years morphs into a multiverse of confusing selection processes any Marvel movie would be proud of.Otherwise, what may have been intended as a circling of the wagons could quickly turn into Custer’s Last Stand..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsDepartment of EducationSDLPSinn FéinMore On Department of Education PremiumViewpointOpinionDivisive transfer test process fails so many pupils Premium‘Plan for new transfer test cannot be a revamp of archaic -plus’ PremiumMale teachers more likely to progress to principal rolesParents of pupils put pressure on Education Minister to act over Covid failures in schools PremiumViewpointOpinionMore men needed in the classroomMost ReadCheers!

Credit: Liam McBurney PASuzanne BreenTwitterEmailSeptember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe SDLP has cancelled its annual conference next month due to the continuing high Covid- infection rates in Northern Ireland.The party said its first priority was the “health and well-being” of its members and the wider community.Some other parties are going ahead with their conferences. The Ulster Unionists will gather on October - in Belfast, and the Sinn Fein ard fheis will be held in Dublin three weeks later.The DUP and TUV have no current plans to hold a conference but haven’t ruled one out before the end of the year. Alliance is holding its annual gathering in the spring.Amidst increasing speculation about the DUP collapsing power-sharing and a January Assembly election being called, the annual conference is potentially more important to the parties now in terms of rallying their supporters and motivating their grassroots to canvass.But with over , Covid cases reported in Northern Ireland every day, and the health service under unprecedented pressure, the SDLP said it had decided to postpone its conference until next year.“We had hoped to hold our annual conference in Derry in the autumn,” a spokesman said.“But in light of the consistently high numbers of Covid- cases, and the pressure on frontline health services, the SDLP has taken the decision to delay the event until the New Year.“Our first responsibility is to the health and well-being of our members as well as exhibitors and guests who attend our conference and we take that very seriously.“We are continuing to encourage everyone to get both doses of their vaccine to help our health service cope during a dficult winter and protect all those around us.”Asked about their ard fheis plans, Sinn Fein said it would be “a mixture of people attending in person at a venue in Dublin and online” on October .Alliance said: “We are aiming to hold a conference in the spring. With the ongoing pandemic and Covid-related restrictions, we believe it would not be viable to hold an in-person event this year.”A TUV spokesman said: “We have had dficulties sourcing a venue that would be comfortable in hosting our conference in line with Covid restrictions.So we have no current plans for a party conference, but that might change.”The DUP said: “We are holding an event to mark the th anniversary of the party next week.We intend to hold a conference in coming months but will be reviewing in line with developments.”The UUP will gather on Friday fortnight with Doug Beattie due to address his first ever annual conference as leader on Saturday afternoon. The party said delegates will have to pre-register online. Along with journalists and exhibitors, they will have to provide proof of being double jabbed. Without evidence of vaccination, they will be asked to show a negative lateral flow test taken no more than  hours earlier.Iniduals could also gain entry by showing proof of natural Covid antibodies based upon a positive PCR test within  days of the conference, the UUP said.The party explained that it was asking everyone attending to take a lateral flow test and report the result two days after the conference. It said face masks will be mandatory and numbers at the conference will be “limited based on the latest Covid- regulations and guidance, and the event risk assessment.”In Britain, the parties have gone ahead with their annual conferences, although the Liberal Democrats opted for a virtual event which has just ended. Labour’s conference opens in Brighton on Saturday with the Tories annual gathering in Manchester on October -. Physical annual conferences were cancelled last year with the parties hosting virtual gatherings.There would be serious repercussions for a partytheir conference became a ‘super spreader’ event.Related topicsColum EastwoodSDLPAlliance PartySinn FéinUlster Unionist PartyTraditional Unionist VoiceDoug BeattieMore On Colum EastwoodHospitality Ulster claims no consultation on SDLP vaccine passport plan, as Eastwood says he spoke to we and others PremiumMy friend Pat Hume played a crucial role in peace process, says Daphne Trimble PremiumTD calls for cross-border ‘John Hume University’ in north west but Department says ‘no need’ for it PremiumAlban MaginnessOpinionOmbudsman report shows why a light must stay on the past… Murder of innocent people cannot be wiped away by Troubles amnestyArdoyne murder probe: Womanremains under arrest, police confirmMost ReadCheers!

Credit: Kevin Scott Belfast John BreslinSeptember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMillionaire broadcaster Stephen Nolan believes he is not a success in le because of a failure to manage his weight — and not having any children.In a candid interview, the television and radio presenter said he hated when people suggest he is a success because of his millionaire status.“I hate people suggesting I’m successful because I’m not,” the -year-old told the Sunday Times.“Being a millionaire is not a success to me. The two things I would consider successful would be to have a normal weight and children. I don’t have either.”As he ages, Nolan revealed he is more and more worried about his health. Several years ago, the presenter managed to reduce his weight from  stone to , but has since put most of it back on.“I’m a complete failure with my health. Weight has defeated me and continues to defeat me,” he said.“No matter how hard I drive myself in other things, I’m a total and absolute failure with my weight. It gets me down, it worries me. Now I’m getting older, it worries me even more. I can’t beat it. I cannot do it.” Daily Headlines Newsletter  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      The presenter, who fronts The Nolan Show on BBC Radio Ulster, Stephen Nolan on BBC Radio  Live and Nolan Live, which s to BBC on Wednesday, defended his more than £, salary, among the broadcaster’s highest. “I like earning money. I don’t think people in London should just be on the BBC’s Top Ten earning list. You should be able to sit in Northern Ireland, or in any of the nations, and punch in big figures,” he said.He also revealed libel suits have been filed against two more iniduals he claims abused him online.Nolan, recently awarded large sums totalling more than £, after successful actions against two other internet “trolls”, vowed he will spend money going after people he believes are trying to destroy him.A writ has been issued in the High Court in Belfast against a Northern Ireland-based businesswoman, while the second claim will be in the High Court in Dublin against an estate agent based in the Republic of Ireland, Paul Tweed, his solicitor, told the Sunday Times.Mr Tweed also represented former First Minister Arlene Foster, who was awarded £, damages over a tweet by Christian Jessen, the presenter of Channel ’s Embarrassing Bodies“I don’t want to hurt people. I don’t want to be this rich guy going after people, but I’m as vulnerable as anyone ,” he said. “Rather than buy a new car I will spend my money going after somebody who has set out to destroy me.”He added: “I get a lot of abuse about my presentation style. That’s acceptable. I get a lot of abuse about my weight. I talk about it, so there we go.“But when someone threatens to put a bullet in your head ... I let that go for a while, then I thought, ‘No’. When there are people setting out to destroy me, and that is their sole aim ... In the past I would have turned a blind eye to that. I’m proactively going after them now.”His vow comes ahead of the second reading of a bill to update the law to bring it more into line with England, where reforms were introduced in  amid concerns London had become a libel destination for plaintfs from ious parts of the world. Nolan also made a revealing comment about the regularity of crises happening here.“For those of us who live in Northern Ireland it seems as though we’re always at a critical juncture.

The event has been organised by Concern Worldwide which has experienced a very dficult year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Covid- has restricted the activities of many voluntary groups and Concern is no exception. Mick Conway, from Concern, said: “We had to cancel last year’s walk due to the Covid restrictions. This was a big blow as the walk is our major fund raising event. Fortunately, our bookshop in Ferryquay Street has reopened and is being very well supported.” googletag.cmd.push The decision by the British Government to reduce its contribution to development aid from .% to .%. was a hammer blow to many of Concern’s programmes in the  countries in which they work. Local contributions have, therefore, gained greater signicance. Mr Conway added: “News bulletins make dficult to avoid the problems throughout the world. Afghanistan is just the latest example. Unimaginable problems quickly fade from our consciousness: earth- quakes and hurricanes in Haiti, war in Syria, religious persecution of the Rohingya in Bangladesh. “For the vast majority of people in these situations these disasters are beyond their control. In our more fortunate circumstances they are beyond our experience or imagination. With our help Concern can continue to support a wide iety of programmes helping many people throughout the world. “Concern prides itself on the efficient transfer of the money they raise to those in most need around the world. Concern has always placed huge emphasis on relieeing hunger. Hunger is an immediate problems but its long term affects have letime consequences for iniduals and whole societies. “In Chad, Niger and Bangladesh, food programmes tackle food insecurity. In Somalia, there is special emphasis in health education. Research is being funded in Sierra Leaone to improve the delivery of educaction in schools. In Kenya Concern is supporting a scheme to produce medical equipment suitable for local needs.     “Afghanistan is currently top of the news agenda. Concern has being working there for many years and continues with its work in spite of the dficulties. Donations to the current Afghanistan appeal can be made through the website: concern.org. uk or in our bookshop in Ferryquay Street. Urging support for Sundays walk, Mr Conway said: “You can make your own contribution by supporting our walk on September . The walk begins at the foot of Scalp Mountain above Burnfoot. Signposts will direct those taking part. Starting times are from . noon to .pm. Car parking is available. “Given the nature, of the event there should be minimum risk of Covid-. There is a good road to the summit and although steep the walk should take no more than an hour-and-a-half. There are spectacular views of Derry and Donegal all the way . “There is no guarantee as to the weather so suitable clothing is advised. Family groups are very welcome. There will be a voluntary collection of donations.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Mickey attended St Columbs College, as did many from the south Derry area in those days.Like his siblings, he had a keen interest in all things GAA but his playing career was cut short following a serious motorcycle accident at the age of  years leaving him in a coma for six weeks. On his recovery, he worked as a shop man in Ballinascreen and later in Dunloy so was well known to many in those areas. Mickey and his we Nan later ran the shop in Moydamlaght, Moneyneana.After a number of years living in Magherafelt, to facilitate work in Enkalon in Antrim, Mickey ed to his beloved we Nans roots in Tamnaherin where they continued to raise their family. At his funeral, Fr McDermott noted that the gospel message of modesty was very apt with how much pride and love he had for his family.He was the loving father of Marie, Brian, Martin and Carmel, father-in-law of Fiona and Bronagh, the much loved grandfather of Lorcan, Darragh, Conor, Kian and Shea, son of the late Thomas and Mary and dear brother of Patsy, Margaretand the late Tommy and John.Mickeys other love of GAA continued throughout his long le and he travelled the country to watch Ballinascreen, Slaughtmanus and his beloved Doire, often accompanied by family and friends. On hearing of his passing, a friend said Mickey was a wonderful character. A true Gael. He never forgot his Ballinascreen roots. We will all miss him.Like all Derry Gaels, his best memory was the countys  All-Ireland triumph.Slaughtmanus paid tribute to him saying Mickey was a letime member and stalwart supporter of the Slaughtmanus GAC club, he was very knowledgeable about all things Gaelic football. He would always stop to talk to any fellow Gael about weekly results and news from teams and clubs around the countyMickey is my wes uncle and I can vividly remember our first conversation, a Sunday evening call to check the days results, performances and talking points. It didnt take long to realise he had a photographic memory. No detail was ever missed.“What Mickey didnt know was not worth knowing. a great and interesting conversationalist,” commented local GAA writer Bernie Mullan to me.In his later years Mickey worked in the car parks in Derry City, a role that allowed him to chat to many people, often leading to a few queues at the exit.When Derry released a yearbook in the mid-eighties Mickey penned an article on his memory of attending the final in Dublin, entitled: ...and they even came from Tobermore. The detailed account of before and during the match captured the emotions of the day with even a horse and cart forming part of the journey. googletag.cmd.push An clipping of an article written by Mickey about the  All-Ireland Final.Coming out of Owenbeg on Sunday night, Ballinderry stalwart Pat McGuckin spoke of Mickeys memory and knowledge for GAA, informing me of how he could recite – by heart – the dates of birth of Derrys  team who reached the All-Ireland final.Mickeys self built garden sheds were a treasure trove of newspaper clippings, photos and video tapes of matches, encapsulating his love and passion of all things GAA.Mickey also had a love of gardening with the family home always in pristine condition, with lawns and hedges manicured to the last detail.His gardening skills were well utilised during his time working with Martin Dolan laying lawns and gardens on many new housing developments in the Eglinton area where his legacy will live on.His family will miss him dearly, but the memories and esteem in which he was held is a hand of comfort.A gentleman. A le well-lived, who is now, as Fr McDermott pointed out, walking through the garden of heaven.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Counties are currently instructed to provide team sheets to the relevant organising body for match programme purposes no later than am on the Thursday before a weekend fixture. However, several counties communicate their line-ups with the proviso that they are not to be issued to the public until they themselves publish them. When they do, a number don’t include their  substitutes. googletag.cmd.push The GAA are to release the team and substitute lists more than  hours before the first matches as a means of promoting the games as well as cutting out the possibility of leaks. It is envisaged the move might prompt counties to announce their line-ups before Friday. The Thursday morning registration, which prevents counties from making th-hour changes to their squad unless in an emergency, was voted in at Congress in Paacuteraic Duffy’s time as director-general as a way of combatting dummy teams. Penalties for not providing the -man list included the withdrawal of sideline privileges for the manager for one match and a fine of up to €, for the county board. Forfeiture is the punishment for fielding a player who has not been registered on the list provided to the referee. The lack of consideration in the rules for late injuries and sickness has been regularly condemned by managers and there have been some instances where less than  players have been available as the deadline for personnel changes had passed and injured men have togged out with no intention of being used.     Match regulations state for non senior inter-county championship games the teams are to be issued to the committee in charge for the official programme and media four days before the game although it is rarely respected, while for league games, the home county must receive team selection from the visitors no later than Wednesday prior to the fixture. For Saturday games, several of the leading counties in both codes make their team disclosures the night previous.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Cllr Heaney, who represents the Foyleside ward, hailed the decision as “an important move” in helping motorists to transition from traditional fossil fuels – such as petrol and diesel – towards electric power. googletag.cmd.push The Parking Strategy for Derry City and Strabane District identied the need to review the current electric charging infrastructure and quanty the council’s future needs as one of its proposed strategic options. It is hoped that by changing the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in its off-street car-parks, the council is removing any potential barrier to visit and stay in the city Cllr Heaney said: “At the council meeting, we agreed to explore further the possibility of getting new and improved electric charging points for electric motor vehicles into all council car-parks throughout our city and district. “It is an important move as the council plays its part in tackling the climate crisis as we encourage and incentivise as many motorists as possible to move away from fossil-fuelled cars and into electric cars. We want to see this progressing soon. “I was delighted to support this proposal at the council’s Business and Culture committee. Recent figures have revealed that only . per cent of electric vehicles in the north are owned by residents of our council area. “The lack of modern and efficient electric vehicle charging points within our council boundaries is clearly a factor influencing this low figure.     “Council officers have now been tasked with scoping out how charging points can be installed in all council car parks which will massively increase the charging infrastructure, encourage the purchase of more electric vehicles and further decrease the carbon footprint within our city and district.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has notied MLAs of her intention to approve the long-awaited major new development. The news has been welcomed by Foyle SDLP MLA, Sinead McLaughlin who said: “I am delighted that we are now making progress at Fort George. googletag.cmd.push “I have been engaged in extensive discussions to enable planning approval to be given for new developments at the site. “These discussions have involved the council, government departments, Catalyst and others.  “The Fort George location is one of the most important in Derry, with a commanding and beautul view of the River Foyle. It has long been intended to be one of the transformative development sites in the city, but has been held back by a series of dficulties over the last two decades. “We are now on the journey to realising important regeneration schemes on the site. “As well as the construction of a second Catalyst business innovation centre, there is to be a major health facility at Fort George. Additional private sector proposals will be considered for other parts of the site. These developments will be supported by new road infrastructure. I hope and expect we will see signicant job creation flow from the projects.” Ms McLaughlin concluded: “Getting approval across the line has been very challenging, and I would like to thank Minister Mallon, other parts of government and the council for working together and with myself to resolve dficulties.”     In a letter to MLAs, seen by the Derry News, Ms Mallon said: “I have considered the report and advice from my officials and I have decided that reserved matters consent should be approved for the proposed development. It is my intention to announce that a Notice of Opinion to approve will be prepared and issued in the near future.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The news has been welcomed by Foyle SDLP MLA, Sinead McLaughlin who said: “I am delighted that we are now making progress at Fort George. googletag.cmd.push “I have been engaged in extensive discussions to enable planning approval to be given for new developments at the site. “These discussions have involved the council, government departments, Catalyst and others.  “The Fort George location is one of the most important in Derry, with a commanding and beautul view of the River Foyle. It has long been intended to be one of the transformative development sites in the city, but has been held back by a series of dficulties over the last two decades. “We are now on the journey to realising important regeneration schemes on the site. “As well as the construction of a second Catalyst business innovation centre, there is to be a major health facility at Fort George. Additional private sector proposals will be considered for other parts of the site. These developments will be supported by new road infrastructure. I hope and expect we will see signicant job creation flow from the projects.” Ms McLaughlin concluded: “Getting approval across the line has been very challenging, and I would like to thank Minister Mallon, other parts of government and the council for working together and with myself to resolve dficulties.”     In a letter to MLAs, seen by the Derry News, Ms Mallon said: “I have considered the report and advice from my officials and I have decided that reserved matters consent should be approved for the proposed development. It is my intention to announce that a Notice of Opinion to approve will be prepared and issued in the near future.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Dermot Nicholl,Chair of the Causeway Coast and Glens Local Action Group said they were delighted with the works at all eight locations. “The origin of this project stems from Estonia, where similar Picture Frames have been used for several years to attract tourists to the area of South Estonia, he said. This has proved to be very successful for our friends there and has seen tourism soar in rural areas.” The Picture This trail will be featured in out of home advertising at key sites throughout Northern Ireland while a digital promotional campaign will target both domestic and international visitors.

Across the north of Ireland, , applicants were still waiting for new accommodation as of June . Mr Durkan, who is the SDLPs Social Justice Spokesperson as well as an MLA for Foyle, said that action was needed now to get people into homes. He said: “These figures are startling but somewhat expected given the economic consequences of the pandemic resulting in more and more people experiencing housing stress. “It is staggering that in the Foyle constituency alone there are nearing five thousand applications for social housing. “The housing crisis pre-existed Covid although it’s clear that the crisis has deepened signicantly in the interim, as evidenced by the  per cent increase in applications in just  months. “It’s important to take stock of the lives behind these statistics to consider that behind each application are iniduals, families and many children waiting in anguish. The time for robust and honest conversations about tackling housing shortages has long past. “It is unforgivable that Foyle consistently top of the leagues it wants to be the bottom of and vice versa.     “Housing is an historic issue in Derry and it remains the case that so many families and their children are left without a place to call home or find themselves stuck in overcrowded properties, wholly unsuitable to their needs. “Housing is yet another example of the deprivation people in Derry have had to endure and while I welcome the incoming Housing Supply Strategy addressing housing need goes far beyond just building homes. “Regulation of the Private Sector under the Private Tenancies Bill again is welcome however affordability issues which have become more profound in recent months must be tackled to prevent homelessness in the time ahead. “Urgent action must be taken before more and more iniduals end up on the streets.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Opel’s ground-breaking powertrain technology and architecture means that the low, flat battery gives the Vio-e a stable centre of gravity and maximum cabin space. Designed from the ground up with both diesel and electric powertrains in mind, the Vio-e is based heavily on the Opel Corsa-e and its driveline fits comfortably between the chassis rails of the new Vio-e.     Power comes from a kW motor producing Nm of torque for smooth, swt and linear acceleration. The kWh battery is made up of  modules consisting of  inidual cells, while the larger kWh battery has  cells split over  modules.Cooling for the batteries comes from the van’s own in-cab cooling system, which Opel says helps to increase their range and letime. All Vio-e models come with three driving modes and switchable regenerative braking as standard.The standard on-board charger is a .kW single phase unit, while DC charging of up to kW is also supported.Trim and Body Options         Trim levels in the new Vio-e  van consist of Edition and Sportive models, both of which come with standard features such as driver and passenger airbags, electric parking brake, cruise control, full size spare wheel, .” colour dashboard display, remote central deadlocking, two side loading doors, electric front windows, electrically adjustable and heated door mirrors, -speaker audio with a USB inlet, Bluetooth, steering-column remote audio controls, and a DAB radio.Top-spec Sportive trim brings with it air-conditioning, ” colour touchscreen with smartphone projection, body coloured bumpers , LED daytime running lights, front fog lights, rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, electrically folding door mirrors, acoustic windscreen and full-size wheel covers.Available with two body s and two roof heights, the Vio-e is just as flexible as a diesel van with a load volume of up to .m. Because the batteries are between the chassis rails, the total capacity of the load space is completely unchanged, allowing ,mm s in the L model and up to ,mm in the L when using the load-through bulkhead.Otherwise, the standard maximumcapacity of the van is ,mm for the L and ,mm for the L.Payloads are equally impressive, as replacing the engine and transmission with batteries and a motor doesn’t signicantly harm it’s capacities.All Vio-e vans have a gross vehicle weightof .-tonne, and depending on spec you can get a maximum ,kg payload out of a L standard roof height van with the kWh battery.Specying the larger kWh unit brings that figure down to ,kg.Those figures are just kg less than a diesel-engine Vio — a far cry from the disadvantage that battery electric vehicles used to have when compared to diesel-powered vans in the past.Test VanMy test van was a new Vio-e SportivekWh finished in stylish Moonstone Grey metallic paint. The three-seater Vio-e has storage under the passenger bench, while the driver’s seat comes with an adjustable armrest and -way seat adjustment. Being an electric van where the full amount of torque is available from just rpm all the way up to ,rpm, it is exceptionally quick off the mark.Unladen, the Vio-e accelerates with impressive urgency, and I have no doubt it would still prove fast even with a full payload on board.The top speed is limited to km h in order to preserve the battery range, but this is something that should not be of any concern to Vio-e drivers, as the van is more than capable of overtaking slower moving traffic with great ease.The regenerative braking system in the Vio-e is selected by pressing the ‘B mode’ button beside the gear selector, and this applies enough braking to activate the brake lights and slow the vehicle down before the driver presses the brake pedal.I loved the fact that the Vio-e is very car-like to drive, and the selectable Eco, Normal and Power driving modes ensure that there is a mode to suit every type of driver and every type of load. The Vio-e remains composed and comfortable when driven over rutted road surfaces, while body lean through bends is very well controlled.The Vio-e pulls away in silence, with just a hum from the on-board sound generator that is designed to warn others of your presence at low speeds, with just minimal levels of tyre and wind noise noticeable at higher speeds.Charging TimesCharging the Vio-efrom a domestic socket can take up to  hours, but this drops dramatically to . hours when charged from a .KW wall box charger .However, DC rapid charging from a kW sourcetakes just half an hour for the kWh battery and  minutes for the kWh version.Verdict  PricingOverall, the new Opel Vio-e is a genuinely impressive van to drive, easy to live with on a daily basis, offers fast-charging options and it is a good looking van too.In my opinion, this is the class-leading  van in the all-electric light commercial vehiclemarket right now, and deservedly so too.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Mega Draw excitement is building ahead of Friday night’s extra special EuroMillions promotional event which has a guaranteed jackpot of € million. Since the EuroMillions game launched in Ireland in , there have been  Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners. If tomorrow night’s staggering € million jackpot is won in Ireland, we could see a new Irish winner added to the roll call of jackpot wins. googletag.cmd.push The National Lottery has advised players dreaming of winning big in the th September draw to continue to follow public health guidelines andplaying in retail, to buy their tickets early to avoid queues which will inevitably build in the hours leading up to the cut-off for ticket sales at .pm on Friday evening. Meanwhile, the Lotto jackpot roll continues and is now set to hit an estimated € million. The current Lotto jackpot has been rolling for over three months since Wednesday th June. So far this year, there have been five Lotto jackpot wins by players in Limerick, Kilkenny, Westmeath, Cork and Galway. In the history of the Lotto game in Ireland, only one jackpot in excess of € million has ever been won which was in June  when the Dan Morrissey syndicate from Carlow scooped a whooping €,,. A single winner of Saturday night’s le-changing € millionjackpot would find themselves at number two on the list of all-time highest wins since the game launched in Ireland in .     A National Lottery spokesperson said:“What a weekend we have ahead of us! We could potentially see two hugely le-altering amounts being won by National Lottery players in Ireland. Tomorrow night’s Mega Draw EuroMillions event with a guaranteed € million jackpot is creating incredible excitement amongst our players. If a player in Ireland scoops this astonishing amount, it would bring to , the number of Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners since the game launched in Ireland in . And of course, there is a huge buzz around this weekend’s Lotto draw with the jackpot heading towards an estimated € million, the spokersperon said. The current Lotto jackpot has been on an unprecedented roll without a winner since June and is now edging very close to reaching the current jackpot cap. The Lotto jackpot is currently capped at €. million and this represents the record breaking Lotto jackpot win by the Dan Morrissey syndicate in Carlow in June . Once the jackpot exceeds the cap, no more money will be added to the jackpot prize until it is won. The funds that would normally go to the jackpot will be distributed to the next lower prize tier at which there are winners. If the jackpot is won at an amount higher than €. million, that amount will become the game’s new jackpot cap. “With two incredible jackpots in both EuroMillions and Lotto just a day apart, we are encouraging players to purchase their tickets early as we expect there to be a big uptake in sales ahead of the draw times. We are reminding players that the cut-off time for sales for EuroMillions tickets is at .pm on Friday evening while the cut-off time for sales for Lotto tickets is at .pm on Saturday evening. Tickets can be purchased in-store, on the National Lottery app or atwww.lottery.ie, the spokesperson said.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Taacutenaiste’s comments were later claried with a spokesman saying he is not opposed to % redress. googletag.cmd.push Meeting Mr McHugh said on Wednesday that he was expecting the meeting between himself, Clare TD Joe Carey, Mayo TD Alan Dillon and the party leader to take place before the end of the week.He said it was important “as we get closer to decision day to reiterate and ensure” that commentary is claried as “it can impact on the process”.“Those comments weren’t helpful as they create vulnerability where there is already massive vulnerability at a personal and a family level. “I think it is really important now that the process goes through the channels that it is supposed to go through and we need to be very careful about public commentary at this stage,” he told the Donegal Democrat.“Things can be misinterpreted and because we are coming to the end of the process, it is important that people know who exactly, and how, we will be bringing the process through Cabinet and who is exactly working on this particular item. And that is the minister in charge.”Negotiators on behalf of Donegal homeowners affected by mica made their final submissions to the working group assigned to report on the issue last Friday. A report is due to be delivered to housing minister Darragh O’Brien at the end of the month. He will then bring recommendations to the Cabinet.Mr Varadkar said on Tuesday the Government will have to control the cost of any mica redress scheme as well as other compensation packages that may come down the line.“We do have to bear in mind the impact on the general taxpayer as well.“Behind this issue, theres also the issue of defective apartments, many of them in my constituency.”“Ultimately its not the Government that pays for this, its the taxpayer, the average working person who pays for this, even though they werent responsible in any way for the problems that happen,” Mr Varadkar said.A spokesman for Mr Varadkar told the Irish Examiner that the Taacutenaiste is not opposed to - nor is he ruling out - % redress.“The Taacutenaiste and the Government are conscious of the impact that mica damage has had on people and families across the Northwest,” he said.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Sept   addthis, A player who never let his team mates down, Kevin ‘Crack’ McKeever remained well known and well thought of throughout the city long after he stopped wearing the red and white of Derry City. Long-term City fans have been remembering ‘Crack’ this week following his sudden death at just  years of age, remembering a player who played in numerous positions for his team, with never a complaint. googletag.cmd.push A lelong civil servant, Kevin also worked for many years in Derry Crown Buildings and had two spells with his home town club during his playing days. He was part of the team which played in the club’s first ever league game in the League of Ireland, against EMFA in  at Buckley Park in October , and he ed to the Brandywell in  for a much longer spell. He made  appearances for Derry City overall, scoring  goals, and he has remained a popular figure locally since. With Portadown, Kevin spent just over four and a half seasons at Shamrock Park, scoring  goals in  appearances. He made  appearances scoring  times during the clubs’ first title winning season in   and a further  appearances scoring twice in the   double winning season. A minute’s silence will be held at the Brandywell tomorrow night in memory of the midfielder, ahead of the game between Derry City and Longford. Peter Hutton, who played alongside ‘Crack’ for two years at Derry, still remembers his first encounter of a man Portadown fans called ‘Big Tree’. “He was a lovely big fella,” he said. “My first recollection of Big Crack was when I made my debut for Coleraine when I was  or  in the Bass Irish Cup semi-final. We played an unbelievable Portadown team and Crack was playing in the middle of the park with Roy McCreadie and boys like Joey Cunningham and Alfie Stewart and boys like that.     “They beat us - and I remember this boy in the middle of the park with the long hair. He asked me afterwards was I from Derry and only then did I realise that he was from Derry himself.” Hutton and ‘Crack’ eventually became team mates a few years later, and while he was never the star of the team, he was someone everyone could rely on when needed. “He would have dropped into defence or midfield or just play wherever he was asked,” Hutton recalls. “It was the same at Portadown as well. He was held in high regard up there by the supporters and the players who thought the word of him. It was exactly the same at Derry, he was versatile and he would have just gone in and done a job anywhere. “Week in and week out he would have given you a seven or right out of ten he would never have let you down anywhere he was asked to play. He would just have got on with it and was low maintenance for managers he wouldn’t have been a fella demanding to be playing or causing ructionshe wasn’t picked.” FAI Cup memories ‘Crack’ was left frustrated when it came to the FAI Cup during his time at Derry. He played in the  - loss to Sligo Rovers, and was then an unused substitute in the  success against Shelbourne. He was never allowed to forget that loss against Sligo by team mates who needed little excuse for a bit of fun. “He loved the craic and the banter and the camaraderie in the changing rooms,” Hutton recalled. “He played in the final where we were beaten by Sligo. We always slagged him because it seemed that any chance we had in that game fell to Crack and he obviously didn’t score because we were beaten -. He got dog’s abuse off the players for it, but it was just in jest. “Obviously he didn’t get blamed for it but he did get dog’s abuse from the boys in the changing room for the chances he did miss. He scored in the next game we played against Sligo after that and he just got more abuse because he couldn’t do that in the final. He was just a lovely big fella who loved his football and he was just a nice fella to be around.” Funeral arrangements Kevin’s funeral will take place from his home,  Templegrove, tomorrowat .am to Holy Family Church, Ballymagroarty for Requiem Mass at .am. Interment afterwards in the City Cemetery.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Sept   addthis, A player who never let his team mates down, Kevin ‘Crack’ McKeever remained well known and well thought of throughout the city long after he stopped wearing the red and white of Derry City. Long-term City fans have been remembering ‘Crack’ this week following his sudden death at just  years of age, remembering a player who played in numerous positions for his team, with never a complaint. googletag.cmd.push A lelong civil servant, Kevin also worked for many years in Derry Crown Buildings and had two spells with his home town club during his playing days. He was part of the team which played in the club’s first ever league game in the League of Ireland, against EMFA in  at Buckley Park in October , and he ed to the Brandywell in  for a much longer spell. He made  appearances for Derry City overall, scoring  goals, and he has remained a popular figure locally since. With Portadown, Kevin spent just over four and a half seasons at Shamrock Park, scoring  goals in  appearances. He made  appearances scoring  times during the clubs’ first title winning season in   and a further  appearances scoring twice in the   double winning season. A minute’s silence will be held at the Brandywell tomorrow night in memory of the midfielder, ahead of the game between Derry City and Longford. Peter Hutton, who played alongside ‘Crack’ for two years at Derry, still remembers his first encounter of a man Portadown fans called ‘Big Tree’. “He was a lovely big fella,” he said. “My first recollection of Big Crack was when I made my debut for Coleraine when I was  or  in the Bass Irish Cup semi-final. We played an unbelievable Portadown team and Crack was playing in the middle of the park with Roy McCreadie and boys like Joey Cunningham and Alfie Stewart and boys like that.     “They beat us - and I remember this boy in the middle of the park with the long hair. He asked me afterwards was I from Derry and only then did I realise that he was from Derry himself.” Hutton and ‘Crack’ eventually became team mates a few years later, and while he was never the star of the team, he was someone everyone could rely on when needed. “He would have dropped into defence or midfield or just play wherever he was asked,” Hutton recalls. “It was the same at Portadown as well. He was held in high regard up there by the supporters and the players who thought the word of him. It was exactly the same at Derry, he was versatile and he would have just gone in and done a job anywhere. “Week in and week out he would have given you a seven or right out of ten he would never have let you down anywhere he was asked to play. He would just have got on with it and was low maintenance for managers he wouldn’t have been a fella demanding to be playing or causing ructionshe wasn’t picked.” FAI Cup memories ‘Crack’ was left frustrated when it came to the FAI Cup during his time at Derry. He played in the  - loss to Sligo Rovers, and was then an unused substitute in the  success against Shelbourne. He was never allowed to forget that loss against Sligo by team mates who needed little excuse for a bit of fun. “He loved the craic and the banter and the camaraderie in the changing rooms,” Hutton recalled. “He played in the final where we were beaten by Sligo. We always slagged him because it seemed that any chance we had in that game fell to Crack and he obviously didn’t score because we were beaten -. He got dog’s abuse off the players for it, but it was just in jest. “Obviously he didn’t get blamed for it but he did get dog’s abuse from the boys in the changing room for the chances he did miss. He scored in the next game we played against Sligo after that and he just got more abuse because he couldn’t do that in the final. He was just a lovely big fella who loved his football and he was just a nice fella to be around.” Funeral arrangements Kevin’s funeral will take place from his home,  Templegrove, tomorrowat .am to Holy Family Church, Ballymagroarty for Requiem Mass at .am. Interment afterwards in the City Cemetery.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmette Dillon.Sadness as body of missing Derry man Emmette Dillon recovered overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Broken glass placed across County Derry road was ‘extremely dangerous’ overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Wednesday, nd September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans to develop the Fort George site are set to get the green light.Green light for Derrys Fort George site overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick OKane pictured inside his shop on New Row, Coleraine.Young butcher keeping the tradition going on County Derry street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes paid to well-known County Derry car dealer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police seize drugs worth pound, in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lyra McKee shot dead in Derry in April .Two men arrested in Derry in Lyra McKee murder probe overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Fteen men in court charged with taking part in illegal Derry parades overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About in Walshs Hotel, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Immediately alarm bells would be ringing butyou choose to look beyond the art rock band bit you really are in for a treat. They were assembled in Derry in  by Adam Leonard, who is from Manchester, Chris McConaghy, who is from Our Krypton Son, Gavin McCartney and his brother, Rio, from most of the bands you’ve ever seen, and they play post-punk songs. See post punk would’ve done Adam, Art-Rock  googletag.cmd.push They released their debut album in  and their new one Peter Gabriel is out this week. Oh, and Gavin and Rio are now James Cunningham and Tom Doherty. James is a kopite so we won’t be talking to him, but I did ask Tomwhat he thought ofInvaderband’s first album  “Excellent that was why I decided to join up.” Do you think youll ever be able to play in a band with a bass player that enjoys football  “It’s good to have a bit of banter with him especially when we beat ‘Pool at Anfield.” What was it like making a record during lockdown  “Strange more so with not being in studio for  years.” Apart from the Nerve Centre online gig, how much do you want to get out and play live  “Can’t wait for album launch on  October first live gig with Jamsie in band”. They’re playing Bennigans on October th and you should head down.     I suppose the most important question and the one on everybody’s lips isare you a better drummer than others because you support Everton  “Obviously.” I recently asked Adam he feltInvaderband have improved since bringing an Everton fan in to play drums  “I do, yes. Tom is a brilliant drummer and he’s really enjoying it which has kind of reinvigorated the rest of us. Re: Everton. I asked him about this, and he said something about toffees. I’ve no idea. Football is for morons.” About his writing songs for a while,do you have a pile from the s you can just use, or do you still write away  “Yeah, I don’t need to write anymore because I have such an archive of ones from the s. That’s why they’re so good.“ The Beatles were recording I Want You ’ the day I was born, so it’s in my Northern English blood.” It’s almost like he’s lording it over us that the English colonised Ireland back when Adam was young, but while we’re on the subjecthow awful were the Beatles  “Only a moron would ask that question.” I know what you’re thinking, does Adam know what the word moron means  Probably not but as we’respeaking of terrible,you really like the Darkness  “The word you’re looking for is love. The Darkness are easily the most exciting band on Earth. No-one  comes close”. At this point I expect loads of people to have fired the paper in the bin, but I can’t stress strongly enough that this is not what we should judge Adam on.” We once enjoyed a fizzy pop at the Northern Ireland Music Prize in  when both Invaderband and Our Krypton Son were up for album of the year. It’s become a total nonsense but Invaderbands single I Wont Remember You is up for Best Single at this year’s NI Music Prize!  Invaderband drummer Tom Doherty  And they’re thankful for the recognition and have posted “please” vote for us here:shorturl.at ajzDLMany thanks!#nimpon their socials, which isn’t as cringeworthy as saying nothing and giving the impression that you’re entitled to it. Adam claims to be a Pavement fan and put me to the test and asked what my favourite song is…Stereo, for those that are interested… anyway he ridiculed me for not picking a more obscure one. At least I think that’s what he was doing but coming from a Beatles fan the point was lost, after all this is a man who once said Joy Division were hopeless. New Order even worse.

Any chemistry student is automatically tutored in such hazards, the campaignersrsquo letter continues.ldquoThis is not a new subject and CIL , had it been so worried about it, should have acted decades ago on the mercury issue. Your concerns now ring hollow and you are using the issue to pursue your own interests in the modernisation of lighthouses.Campaigners have asked CIL to provide evidence of what training was given to lighthouse keepers in mercury usage and what so-called Material Safety Data Sheets on mercury were and are supplied to lighthouses in its jurisdiction.They say they are not impressed with CILrsquos progress when it comes to environmental heritage matters, pointing to the many changes which have taken place at St Johnrsquos Point over the years, including a reduction in use of the borm Fresnel lens to single lens and the removal of the original mechanics that powered the rotating lens.Other changes highlighted by campaigners included the abolition of keepers and attendants and the planned reduction in maintenance of the Killough stationrsquos walls and outbuildings.The letter continues: ldquoWhilst several of these changes may be understandable, you go too far with the removal of the heritage rotation system and in the employment of LED as the light source. You must surely be aware of thegrowing concerns in the environmental community worldwide about LED lighting.ldquoThe Lecale Lightkeepers will further resist your plans for St Johnrsquos Point, but we urge you to take note of the facts and of the strong local opposition to your plan.Campaigners say they are prepared to cooperate with CIL and others in developing suitable preservation plans for the historic lighthouse, including the engine room, while the organisation maintain itrsquo important role as an Aid to Navigation.Their letter adds: ldquoKeeping the existing lens rotation system and a health and safety review of your LED plans are, however, prerequisites to our cooperation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Downe U3A members enjoy fun day out  ","story":"MEMBERS of Downe UA had a marvellous and unusual day out at Crawfordrsquos Rock, near Kilkeel, recently.Local businesswoman Michelle Wilson took them, armed with collecting bags, on a foraging trip along the shore.She pointed out the dferent types of seaweed, telling which of them are best for cooking, which are ingredients of skin care products and which she recommended for a healthy seaweed bath.With their collected seaweeds the group then retreated to a gazebo on the shore where they were served up some shlauch mdash or shlucht mdash seaweed with seaweed bread and cod roe.This was followed by many courses of local produce, langoustines, mussels, crab toes, haddock landed fresh in Kilkeel that morning, then steak, potatoes, seaweed and chilli chocolate, ending with Crawfords Rock Seaweed Companyrsquos award-winning peppermint and kombu tea.The group agreed that it had been a day to remember.

earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre has fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, councillors hope the complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.News of the shock decision to abort the Dunleath Park scheme was confirmed at a meeting in the town on Monday night when it was revealed that for legal and financial reasons, developing the facility at this location was simply not a viable option.If the council forged ahead with the plan for Dunleath Park, it would have to pay compensation to Dunleath Estates, based on the current commercial value of the land required to house the new cinema and associated parking.Alternatively,the existing lease is amended to allow the construction of the cinema, around one third of the income would have to be paid to Dunleath Estates with the remainder of the cash used specically for the playing fields, in keeping with stipulations laid down by the Charities Board when the lease was first drawn up.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A popular Ballynahinch newsagent has this week been forced out of business by burglars who ransacked his store.On Monday the shutters were pulled down on Ricersquos newsagents at High Street and are unlikely to be opened again by the current owner, Mr Eamonn Rice, who said the attack, the third in three years, has left him ldquomentally and physically wrecked.Thieves smashed their way into the store some time between Sunday night and the early hours of Monday morning and after stealing a large amount of property they completely destroyed anything in sight with crow bars and sledge hammers.Police believe the attack was carried out by professionals who are more than likely from outside the area, probably Belfast, and would have needed ready transport to escape with the goods.Yesterday Mr Rice as adamant that he did not want to have anything more to do with the shop saying that he could not go on working there after the heartless attack.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh pensioner, who has been stripped of his -minute-a-day home help, has accused health officials of abandoning him.Seventy eight year-old John Heaney, who can only walk with the aid of walking sticks, says he is ldquogutted his home help service has been axed and claims the decision came out of the blue.Mr Heaney, from Grove Park, said the first he knew about the decision to remove his daily home help cam when the woman who has been attending him for the past number of years informed him two weeks ago she would not be back.He said he now has no idea what the future hold and fears what may happen when winter sets in and he has no help to light his fire in the morning.Local community worker Billy Walker, who is fighting the decision to remove Mr Heaneyrsquos home help assistance, said the pensioner cannot believe he has been singled out for such unfair treatment.The community worker said he understand the Down Lisburn Trust is strapped for cash to provide a number of community care services, including those aimed at specically helping elderly people.STRANGFORD mdash Pensioners have finally been granted free travel across Strangford Lough following a drawn out campaign by local politicians.Regional Development Minister Gregory Campbell announced the decision to include the Strangford to Portaferry crossing in the free travel for the elderly scheme during a meeting with Strangford MP Iris Robinson.Down councillor Peter Craig and Strangford MLA Kieran McCarthy have been at the forefront of the free travel for pensioners campaign.Describing the ferry crossing as a ldquovital service, Mr Campbell said he ldquofirmly believed free fares should be offered to senior citizens, in keeping with the Department for Regional Developmentrsquos policy to target concessions at users of public transport.The travel scheme will only be available to passengers over  years-old who are travelling by foot and will not be put into effect until January.The Ministerrsquos announcement comes at the same time as confirmation that the pound.m ferry, the MV Portaferry II, will be delivered towards the end of

Fishermanrsquos Row and have already raised the issue with the Killough Community Association.Councillor Eamonn McConvey says he is concerned at what is happening and has asked Down Council to determinelegislation exists which prohibits sand and shingle being taken from the beach.NEWCASTLE mdash A telecommunications company which sparked controversy in Newcastle in recent weeks has taken steps towards healing damaged relations with local people.BT Cellnet representatives last week dismantled a mast at the Castlewellan Road in the town in an effort to appease the action group, Residents Against Masts , which was established to fight against the structure.The pressure group was formed last Monday night, just hours before the mast was erected against the wishes of local people who believe that it may put the health of children at risk.Following repeated calls by residents, BT Cellnet officials removed the -metre lamp post just two days later.The removal of the equipment has been hailed as a breakthrough by members of the RAM who have vowed to continue to fight against similar proposals in the town.A BT Cellnet spokesman this week confirmed that the mast had been taken down as a ldquogesture, but added that this was a ldquotemporary move.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Work to provide a new storm drain at a housing estate on the outskirts of Castlewellan is due to to start shortly.South Down MP Eddie McGrady has been lobbying the Housing Executive to ensure the drain is provided at the JFK estate in Burrendbridge as soon as possible.The MP said money for the scheme has been earmarked and revealed the drain will be provided at an alley-way at the rear of a number of houses.Mr McGrady said the drain is being installed in response to residentsrsquo complaints about flooding at their homes during exceptionally wet weather.ldquoThe contractor was due to start work last week and the scheme should take around one month to complete, he explained.ARDGLASS ndash Vandals who targeted a toilet block in Ardglass last week are doing nothing to help the image of the village.Councillor Dermot Curran said the people behind Sunday nightrsquos attack at the Quay have no understanding about the consequences their actions could have.The toilet block was badly damaged during the attack and an attempt was also made to set fire to the building which houses the only public toilet facility in the village.Describing the actions of the vandals as ldquodisgraceful and despicable, Mr Curran revealed the toilets will be closed for at least a week.He said at a time when a number of groups are aiming to raise the profile of Ardglass, along comes a group which targets a toilet block.ldquoThese people have no understanding about the impact their attacks will have on the village and the people who live in Ardglass, he declared.Mr Curran said in addition to the weekend vandal attack, litter was also thrown over the playing fields in the

Championship campaign with an impressive win over last yearrsquos runners-up Carryduff on a sun-drenched Saturday evening.Despite being considered slight underdogs before the contest, the green and white outfit proved they were anything but as they found the back of the net three times in the opening half.Goals from Oran Cunninghamand captain Conor McGrady put the Hoops too far in front at the interval, with the Carryduff men left frustrated at their missed chances.There was a notable turnout at the Darragh Cross venue, with waves of supporters from both sides allowing their voices to be heard throughout the duration of the match.Despite Carryduff winning the throw-in, it was Downpatrick who opened the scoring through a Jarlath Brannigan free after three minutes had been played.Brannigan doubled his tally just two minutes later in what was a determined start from the Hoops.However, this would be no stroll in the park as Josh Connery dummied his marker to send Carryduffrsquos first effort over the bar after some silky work from team-mate Owen McCabe.Downpatrick goalkeeper and joint captain James Deeny displayed pin-point accuracy with his kick-outs countless times throughout the match but perhaps needed the opening minutes to settle any nerves.A wayward punt upfield was gobbled up by Carryduffrsquos Pearse McCabe who relayed the ball quickly to Cian Clinton to level the scores.Caolan Mooney made his presence known with his usual rapid pace and precision. The former Rostrevor and current county player drew a foul before Conor McCarron calmly converted to put Downpatrick back in front.It was Carryduffrsquos turn to showcase their county talent as Daniel Guinness again levelled the tie with an emphatic point before captain Joe McFlynn swung the match back in their favour.However, with a minute to go to the first water-break Downpatrick got the reward for their relentless work in the middle of the park.McGrady and Mooney swarmed the Carryduff midfield with a barrage of tackles before some quick passing allowed the ball to enter into the hands of Downpatrickrsquos young forward Oran Cunningham.The Downpatrick number  made no mistake in blasting his effort past opposing lsquokeeper Mark Hynes to give his side a two-point lead.This advantage didnrsquot last until the quarter as Carryduff replied with two well-taken scores to bring the contest even.A few wides from both sides were observed after the water-break before Conor Doherty curled his left-footed free in-between the posts for Downpatrick.With  minutes played on the clock it was Cunningham again who would prove the major dference after his long-ranged effort looped over the head of Hynes and into the back of the net to double his tally.Hynes could be excused for this as Cunninghamrsquos effort struck most around the pitch as a cross rather than an attempt at goal.Nevertheless, Carryduff kept plugging away and answered with a James Guinness point.Conor McGrady saw his effort at goal crowded out by the determined opposing defenders before Gerdie Collins saw his effort drt over the bar to restore Downpatrickrsquos four-point lead.Mooney pointed again for the Hoops before McGrady added his sidersquos third goal of the half after the green and white forward line took advantage of a defensive mix-up.Daniel Guinness tried to rally his team as best as he could, soloing past three RGU shirts before registering the final point of the half. Half-time: Downpatrick - Carryduff -.Whatever the management team of Paddy Doherty, Shane OrsquoNeill and DJ Morgan told their Carryduff side during the interval must have struck a chord as they started the second half with clear intent.Despite a James Guinness wide, points from McCabe and McFlynn chipped away at the deficit for the purple, gold and black side.Cunningham was unlucky not to hit a hat-trick of goals after his lobbed effort was fantastically cleared of the line by Daniel Coogan.RGU followed this up with two efforts which both veered wide, before McFlynn again pointed for Carryduff leaving the score - to - in favour of the Downpatrick side at the second water-break.It was clear that legs were beginning to tire in the final quarter after a gruelling physical showing from both teams meant more and more chances went begging.Downpatrick finally registered their first point of the second half through another Doherty free.Carryduff refused to go quietly and were given added encouragement when RGUrsquos Tim Prenter was shown a black card with five minutes remaining.However, the frustration continued for both Carryduff and James Guinness as his effort veered wide of the target again.Deeny was rewarded for keeping his concentration after making an impressive save with his feet to deny Carryduff a certain goal in the dying moments of the game, although he could do nothing about the converted free a minute later.Mooney fisted over the bar in the next run of play for Downpatrick before Carryduff substitute Joe Tunney completed the scoring in the last passage of play.After the match, Downpatrick manager Aidan Robinson reflected on his sidersquos winning performance.ldquoIn the first half we worked incredibly hard, we turned the ball over a lot at the halfway line which we got a lot of scores from and we managed to get the goals, he said.ldquoWe built a good  for ourselves and spoke at half-time about kicking on from that, but we didnrsquot really manage to.ldquoI think in the third quarter of the game we were pretty flat and Carryduff got back into the tie, but we got over the line and we will learn from that.He added: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the result and very happy to be in the next round.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney, A Doherty, R Murphy, T Smyth, J Bell, C Doherty, D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter, G Collins, C McGrady, J Brannigan, P Turley, C Mooney.Subs: A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, O Cunningham, S Bell, T Loudon, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, R Quinn.Carryduff: M Hynes, D Coogan, C Cassidy, C McCullagh, L Toal, J Connery, D Guinness, B Cox, P McCabe, O McCabe, J McFlynn, C Clinton, S McGonigle, R Beatty, J Guinness.Subs: T Connery, M McGrath, P McConnell, C Sherry, R Reilly, C Cunningham, R Boyle, J Tunney, M Lawson, C Rooney, J Henry, D Connelly, D Connor.Downpatrick -Carryduff -MORGAN FUELS SFC ST ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Joanne.jpg","title":"Joanne organising event to thank Air Ambulance staff  ","story":"A LOCAL show jumper is organising a fund-raising campaign as her way of saying thank you to the Air Ambulance.Joanne Clough was airlted to hospital after suffering a serious head injury. A year on, she has launched the lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo campaign and competition to raise vital funds for Air Ambulance NI.On September  last year Joanne was competing in a show jumping competition at Ardnacashel Equestrian Centre near Comber, when a serious accident meant she needed urgent medical care.Joanne was warming up on her horse, Juno, when the horse seemed to become spooked and jolted, then began bucking uncontrollably, throwing her from the saddle. As she fell to the ground, Joanne hit her head on a brick wall.Joanne, who lives near Crossgar, said: ldquoI have no memory of the event and apparently lost consciousness. Having spoken to others, I know that the show at Ardnacashel was then stopped, and the organisers along with first aiders on site came to my side and called for an ambulance.ldquoEveryone was really supportive and helpful to ensure myself, my horse, my helper and my seven year-old daughter, Erin were looked after.The Air Ambulance carrying the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service Teamlanded in the fields beside Ardnacashel. The team treated Joanne at the scene before transferring her to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.Joanne remained in the hospital for the next  hours, having tests for potential brain injuries, which were even more pertinent as Joanne had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumour in August .Joanne sustained three fractures to her cheek, damaged the iris of her right eye, resulting in blurred vision, and lost her short-term memory for a couple of months due to severe concussion.It has been a long road to recovery, but now Joanne is starting to feel back to normal. She said: ldquoThe scars and fractures on my face have healed, along with the fatigue, weakness and confusion, but my balance remains something that I am continuing investigations for as my eyesight remains imperfect.ldquoMost importantly for a horsey girl, Juno has been treated for pre-existing injury in the sacroiliac joint in her back, which had caused her to react the way she did on the day. After a sincere apology from her, I am slowly gaining trust and confidence in her again in the saddle.Joanne continued: ldquoThere are no words to describe the gratitude I feel for the assistance of the Air Ambulance NI team and crew that day. Had they not acted so quickly, treated me with such level-headed efficiency and taken me to the hospital so swtly, I have no idea how I might have ended up.ldquoA head injury cannot be underestimated and to have been saved from potential disaster by the medical team in this way is a miraculous success. I owe them my everything and to demonstrate my gratitude, I am running a nationwide equestrian campaign and competition to raise awareness and funds for Air Ambulance NI. Thank you so much to the Air Ambulance team mdash you are amazing.With the recent easing of restrictions, Joanne was recently able to visit the Air Ambulance NI airbase and meet with representatives of the medical team.Joanne is encouraging the entire Equestrian Community to support her campaign. You can do so by Supporting the Horse Powered Take Off competition via https:dragoncompetitions product horse-powered-take-off .Including Ambulance NI in your horse show, such as by making a small donation from ticket sales.Organising your own lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo event, such as a cake sale, tea party, sponsored give away, or hack and snack.Working alongside Dragon competitions, Joannersquos competition will run throughout September and October and she has secured some fabulous prizes, including an equine bundle worth pound, from Fane Valley, pound, in cash and a horse solarium worth pound from R Nesbit Paddock Equipment. The winners will be drawn on October  by Dragon Competitions.Grace Williams, Area Fundraising Manager for Air Ambulance NI, said: ldquoWe are so inspired that Joanne has made a great recovery. Patients are at the centre of everything we do, and it is always lovely when patient families choose to get in touch.ldquoWe are humbled she decided to support the of wonderful work of Air Ambulance NI through her equestrian competition and campaign.ldquoAs a service we rely heavily on charitable donations to keep the medical team in the air, delivering critical care to patients who have suffered trauma throughout Northern Ireland.

For that particular scene, we approached Kilmore Coach Hire who drove us around the village until we got what we needed.The cast and crew also filmed inside Bright Parish Church before they set off to allow a christening to take place.ldquoWe were lucky the farmer who owned the surrounding fields was so generous in allowing us to film, as well as the church minister, said Declan.ldquoIt was kindness such as this from the locals which allowed us to make this happen.The McIlmail duo were not the only local faces who appeared in the award winning short, as Newcastlersquos Sandra Brown portrays lsquoMaggiersquo and Crossgarrsquos Chris Heath takes up the role of lsquoEamonrsquo.Notably, not all of these cast members have actually met each other in person. Due to the restrictions in place, actors only metthey were in the same scene.Declanrsquos cousin, Aroacuten Holden from Downpatrick, was the editor for the film who helped piece each scene together. Aroacuten also introduced Declan to a number of others who assisted in creating the short, and therefore was referred to as ldquoan invaluable help by the young director.The short continues to enter numerous film festivals in the hopes of adding more honours, including ceremonies in England, Scotland and the USA.Meanwhile, Declan is currently directing a new featurefilm based in Belfast named lsquoThe Trick Roomrsquo, which entails the story of a cross-community cricket team.To keep up to date with the latest news surrounding Shine, visit @shine_shortfilm on Instagram or check out https:www.imdb title tt ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Jockeys.jpg","title":"Locals among the prizes at Downpatrick meeting  ","story":"IT was a good day for local owners and trainers at Fridayrsquos penultimate meeting of the year at Downpatrick.They were successful in three of the seven races on the card, that featured four over hurdles, two chases and a bumper.

They also recognise the need to offer additional space for extra activities.As part of the consultation process, residents are asked to complete a small online questionnaire, with all information used by the council to determine the best way forward.News of the proposal to upgrade the community centre comes after the local authority was asked to address its under investment in the market town and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities was a critical component of its future investment plans.Earlier this year, the need for ultra-modern leisure provision topped the agenda during an online meeting between local politicians and senior council officials who were asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.Major new leisure provision has recently been provided across the council area, including Downpatrick, Saintfield and Newry, with plans in the pipeline for signicant investment in new leisure services in Newcastle.Politicians say that while Ballynahinch has missed out on major local authority investment over recent years, the organisation needs to address this now to cater for the needs of local people and sporting organisations.They argued that the current community centre needs major improvement or potentially replaced and that funding must be earmarked to allow this to happen.Politicians say itrsquos vital that Ballynahinch is a key part of any future council strategy when it comes to leisure activities.Several councillors believe the current Ballynahinch Centre requires signicant investment to meet the needs of local people and while many favour a new-build, they recognise that this is unlikely in the short to medium term.Moving forward, they say Ballynahinch cannot be left behind given that it has missed out on major funding for a signicant number of years and that ratepayers in the town and surrounding area deserve nothing less.The consultation closes at pm on Wednesday, September  and to take part, log on at https:tinyurl uejtmpc.

I mean be honest, it’s the centenary of the formation of a state which is based on religion so a fall-out over a religious service is definitely on-messagePhrases like ‘prostate examination’, ‘contemporary dance workshop’ and ‘Nolan Show Special’. In the top  of such phrases there must surely be a place for ‘interdenominational church service’. So I have a lot of sympathy with Irish President Michael D Higgins.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...As outreach to unionists, Michael D Higgins could make his speeches from Jamie Bryson’s binIf I were invited to a two hour session on the cold hard pews of a cathedral I would invent literally any excuse to get out of it. I’d say they got my title wrong even though they didn’t .Yes, the political drama this week was caused by the churches who made Michael D an offer he couldn’t refuse until he refused it.Michael D turned down an invitation to a service to mark  years of Northern Ireland.This was a surprise to most people. The events to celebrate the centenary of Northern Ireland have gone well so far. In fact they were going so well that up to now nobody really knew they were happening — and the year is almost over. There was something about schools getting a free tree, Seamus Heaney being a unionist and the Shinners objecting to a stone, but that was it. Ulster’s th birthday bash was nearly as low key as Prince Andrew’s th.I’m old enough to remember the attempt in  to celebrate  years of Northern Ireland, an attempt which was somewhat undermined by the outbreak of what is best described as a D list Civil War. Back then there was an exhibition and a funfair with the catchy slogan ‘Ulster ! Come and join the fun’. ‘Ulster ! Come to church’ quite frankly doesn’t have quite the same ring. So this church service kerfuffle furore came out of the blue. Of course it shouldn’t have. I mean be honest, it’s the centenary of the formation of a state which is based on religion so a fall-out over a religious service is definitely on-message.Michael D’s refusal to go to church to thank God for partitioning Ireland led to entirely predictable reactions from both sides. We all got to check our Northern Ireland ‘outrage’ bingo card. During the week I got — ‘sectarian statelet’, ‘Nationalist hypocrisy’ ‘ years of unionist misrule’ ‘so this is their “New Ireland”!! ’, ‘Ireland unfree will never be at peace’ ‘insult to unionists’ ‘planters’ ‘foreign head of state’ and ‘border poll now!’If you got all of those, congratulations on having a very cross-community twitter feed. If you got only half of those, well ...The church leaders suggested that their service “to mark the centenary of partition of Ireland and the creation of Northern Ireland” was non-political, which, to be polite, is somewhat disingenuous. If it’s non-political and they’re not going to even mention partition then what is the point of it  I’d preferthey went full throttle and properly and unapologetically celebrated Northern Ireland with a reading from the Book of B Specials, a video of Ian Paisley at the  Ulster Says No rally, followed by the parable of the Ulsterman and the  lost counties and ending with a special prayer ‘What God has ided, let no man re-unite’.• As outreach, Michael D could make his speeches from Jamie’s binWhen Michael D’s refusal to go to Armagh emerged there was much heated debate about snubs.Of course both unionists and nationalists have form in this area. All our politicians are professional snubbers and boycotters.Arlene Foster wouldn’t even go to a Republic of Ireland football match in the Euros in . Right now the DUP are sporadically boycotting North South bodies. And Sinn Fein boycotted Stormont for three years. So no-one is coming at this with clean hands. Michael D is a polymath. A poet.  Even the most disappointed unionist would agree that President Higgins is an intelligent, thoughtful and erudite man. He is unlikely to be seen at Feile an Phobail singing ‘ooh aah up the Ra’ along to the Wolfe Tones. However there does seem to have been a failure of diplomacy and some redress is probably called for. Michael D will need to engage in some serious unionist outreach. I have a few suggestions.Perhaps he could donate the tricolour that flies over Aras an Uachtarain to an th night bonfire. Or he could, in future, make all his speeches to the nation from the top of Jamie Bryson’s wheelie bin. And he could start by offering Ben Lowry free Irish language lessons.Another way to make amends would be for Michael D to turn up to watch the Northern Ireland women’s football team. This team is truly cross-community, peace and reconciliation yada yada yada... But everyone should forget about politics and just enjoy the really great job they are doing. Northern Ireland Women have already qualied for next year’s Euros and have won convincingly twice in the last two world Cup qualiers. I’m slightly biased of course because Cltonville legend Marissa Callaghan is also the Northern Ireland captain and three Cltonville players scored against Latvia on Tuesday night. And more importantly they’re a lot cheaper to watch than the men. They take on England on rd October. Let’s mark  years of Northern Ireland and get the Queen, Michael D, Michelle O’Neill and Paul Givan to Wembley. Evenwe lose it’ll definitely be better crack than a church service.l Other articles by Tim McGarry below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letterl Tim McGarry September : Arlene Foster is off to the Lords — and I am going to stand as a TUV candidatel Tim McGarry August : For advice on the benefits of Brexit, just ask the Shinnersl Tim McGarry August : Sir Jeffrey and I have much in common — and we both got into trouble for Team GB tweets——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...He talked about people who have not had their jabs because they “have listened to nonsense that has been going out on social media”.Mr Poots was talking more about anti vaxxer conspiracy theories and not about people whose opposition is based on religious grounds.But even so, his comments are influential because he is a former health minister and a Free Presbyterian.Some anti abortion campaigners are deeply concerned about the link between the developments of vaccines and aborted foetuses. But the vaccines on offer in Northern Ireland do not contain fetal cells. According to the Department of Health, their development has “involved the use of cell lines grown in labs, having been replicated from fetal cells obtained decades earlier” and thus “any link between any vaccine development and abortions is incidental and remote”.The debate about cell lines is a sensitive one. But the conspiracy concerns can be much more easily dismissed, with their grossly exaggerated claims about side effects of the treatments.The vaccines do not necessarily prevent infection with Covid but have been overwhelmingly successful in suppressing its impact on people who have been double jabbed.Many conspiracists are impervious to elementary statistical information on the value of getting vaccinated against coronavirus.As both Mr Eastwood and Mr Poots say, repeated lockdowns are not feasible as a response to Covid. Vaccines are.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We install energy-efficient boilers, which will help you save money on your energy bills whilst achieving our goal to reduce carbon emissions in the UK.\"Check your eligibility and start the simple process by clicking hereWho is First Choice Energy Limited First Choice Energy Limited is based in Dafen Industrial Park, Llanelli.It is passionate about creating a more sustainable world by improving energy systems for homeowners in Wales and is extremely proud to be certied ECO installers helping residents live in more energy-efficient homes - while making our environment more sustainable and eco-friendly.Director Aaron Davies took on the business from his father, who has been in the trade for nearly  years and is still very much hands-on with the team.First Choice Energy Limited is a registered on the Gas Safe Registered Engineers list, it is endorsed by Trustmark Government Endorsed Quality and is Blue Flame approved.What benefits are considered Eligibility for a free boiler grant will depend on several factors. Firstly, a permanent resident within the property needs to be in receipt of one of the following benefits, such as:Armed Forces Independence PaymentAttendance AllowanceCarerrsquos AllowanceChild BenefitConstant Attendance AllowanceDisability Living AllowancePension Guarantee CreditIncome-related Employment and Support Allowance Income-based Jobseekerrsquos Allowance Income SupportIndustrial Injuries Disablement BenefitMobility SupplementPersonal Independence PaymentSevere Disablement AllowanceTax Credits Universal CreditWhat is EC  Funding The Energy Company Obligation or ECO is the name given to the UK Governments programme to make houses more energy efficient on a nationwide basis.The current ECO scheme, ECO, is scheduled to run until  March  and is focused exclusively on lower-income households, a wide range of benefit recipients qualy for improvements in their homes energy efficiency, with measures including new heating systems and boiler upgrades, external insulation, internal insulation and loft insulation as well as double glazing and more.What does the process involve First, fill in the Grant Eligibility Survey to seeyou qualy for the free boiler. Providing you are eligible, the team at First Choice Energy Ltd will speak to you on the phone and then come out and survey your home. This will include things like measuring your floor space, checking the thermostats on your radiators, identying the brand and model of your current gas boiler and asking some general questions regarding your property. A survey generally takes no longer than an hour.When itrsquos time to install a new boiler, your previous boiler will be replaced with a new gas-fired condensing boiler and the floor insulation will be fitted by a carpenter. Although the process sounds messy and time-consuming, on average it takes no longer than a day. And of course, the cost to install the boiler and install the floor insulation is covered by the grant.Will I need to pay any contributions Householders that are eligible for free boiler grants have no obligation to pay back any installments. Plus there are no terms and conditions to be met other than the basic qualying criteria.Why do I need a new boiler Your boiler may be on its way out, or not working properly, so now is the time to act. With energy bills more expensive than ever, your boiler needs to be heating your home for the lowest possible cost. A boiler installed around  years ago will most likely be around -% efficient. So, by upgrading this old boiler to a new one, the carbon savings will be signicant enough to warrant the cost and therefore will qualy under the free boiler scheme.Boilers installed in the UK are required to be condensing boilers. These are far more efficient than traditional boilers as they release gas at just  degrees Celsius , therefore requiring less energy to generate the same amount of heat.What happensI am not eligible The team at First Choice Energy may be able to help you with other grant schemes or offer advice and guidance on how to help with any problems you could face.For more information visit First Choice Energy Ltd or email: Firstchoiceenergylimited@gmail article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Brought to you byFIRST CHOICE ENERGY s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityRecent years have seen increasing numbers of the Grey seal population breeding in and around the lagoon and spotting them is an exciting wildle encounter that many visitors wonrsquot forget.However, the combination of the Blue Lagoons high visitor numbers, and its sheltered nature which makes it so attractive to seals, creates a situation where there is a high potential for disturbance to seals.The time seals spend resting on land is vital to their health and that of their pups as they are digesting a recent meal, socialising, and feeding their young.Blue Lagoon to closeIn order to provide them with a safe environment to raise their pups, National Trust Cymru will be closing the Blue Lagoon to visitors from September  through to November .Visitors will still be able to watch these wild creatures in their habitat from the coastal path and coasteering activity providers who have signed up to the National Trustrsquos Coasteering Agreement and undertaken specic training on how to operate around seals, will still have access to the lagoon with groups of visitors who have booked in advance.Mark Underhill, National Trust Cymrursquos Countryside Manager, Pembrokeshire said: ldquoThere are two species of seal that can be found in Britain the Common seal and the Grey seal. Only Grey seals occur regularly in Pembrokeshire, where they are present all year around.ldquoAbout half the worldrsquos population of Grey Seal breed on our coastline and the total number in West Wales, mostly Pembrokeshire, is estimated to be about ,, with some , pups being born each year.ldquoThe breeding season is vital for our seal colonies here in Pembrokeshire, and we ask that visitors do not access the Blue Lagoon and that they follow the guidelines laid out by the Seal Alliance and Pembrokeshire Marine Code when on the coastal path.Paul Renfro from the Pembrokeshire Coastal Forum said: ldquoThe Pembrokeshire Marine Code recommends remaining at least m away from the seals, though they can be disturbed at any distance so itrsquos important to be responsive to their behaviour.     ldquoIf a resting seal looks up or turns to looks at you then you are close enough at whatever distance you are at. Seals can be particularly sensitive to disturbance after periods of stormy weather and during the breeding season so we recommend giving them extra space at these times.How to avoid disturbing sealsTo avoid disturbing seals at this very important time of year, National Trust Cymru recommends adopting the following strategies:Sssh, stay quiet: Channel your inner David Attenborough and speak with a low voice and encourage your children to do the same. Noisy dogs can frighten seals soyour four-legged friend is a bit chatty, please leave them at home when you visit a seal breeding area.Donrsquot get too close: Ensure you stay at least  metres away from sealsand never come between a seal and her pup, or a seal and the sea. Doing so will cause distress to both the mother and pup.Keep dogs on a short lead: Keep your dog on a short lead. Do not allow them to run loose or play with balls, frisbees or sticks anywhere near a breeding colony as this will cause them distress.What to doyou see a seal in distressIf you spot a lone seal pup on a beach itrsquos probably not in distress. Seal pups are often left alone on the beach whilst its mum goes off to catch dinner.Never approach the seal. It will cause further distress and may be dangerous for you and the Seal.Look to see how many people there are about. In most cases when seals are in distress itrsquos due to contact with curious and well-meaning visitors.If you are still concerned, contact conservation group Welsh Marine Le Rescue   or   who will be able to offer you further guidance. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
